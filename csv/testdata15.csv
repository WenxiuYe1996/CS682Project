Abstract
Our limited understanding of the climate controls on tropical forest seasonality is one of
the biggest sources of uncertainty in modeling climate change impacts on terrestrial
ecosystems. Combining leaf production, litterfall and climate observations from satellite
and ground data in the Amazon forest, we show that seasonal variation in leaf
production is largely triggered by climate signals, specifically, insolation increase (70.4%
of the total area) and precipitation increase (29.6%). Increase of insolation drives leaf
growth in the absence of water limitation. For these non-water-limited forests, the
simultaneous leaf flush occurs in a sufficient proportion of the trees to be observed from
space. While tropical cycles are generally defined in terms of dry or wet season, we show
that for a large part of Amazonia the increase in insolation triggers the visible progress
of leaf growth, just like during spring in temperate forests. The dependence of leaf
growth initiation on climate seasonality may result in a higher sensitivity of these
ecosystems to changes in climate than previously thought.
Introduction 1
The Amazonian forests account for 14% of the global net primary production (NPP) 2
and are a major component (66%) of the inter-annual variation in global NPP [1]. 3
While large seasonal swings in leaf area have been reported at least in parts of the 4
Amazon basin [2{4], the environmental controls that trigger the synchronous 5
development of new leaves are not well understood [5{7]. As a result, current earth 6
system models inadequately represent the dynamics of leaf development, despite its 7
PLOS 1/19major role for photosynthesis of tropical vegetation [8]. In equatorial forests, leaf 8
flushing correlates with increased light availability and photosynthetically active 9
radiation during the dry season [4,9], and is theoretically driven by a change in daily 10
insolation [10]. However, water availability constrains leaf phenology in southern 11
Amazonia and most of the Congo basin, impeding the maintenance of the evergreen 12
state during the dry season [11]. The climate thresholds controlling the phenological 13
responses of vegetation remain unclear [12], as well as the sensitivities of these responses 14
to future climate changes [13]. 15
The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), from the Moderate Resolution Imaging 16
Spectroradiometer (MODIS), improves the sensitivity of the vegetation signal in high 17
biomass regions and it strongly correlates with chlorophyll content and photosynthetic 18
activity [5,14]. An unexpected result from this index was the Amazon forest ""greening"" 19
in the dry season [5]. The evidence provided by the MODIS sensor raised a debate not 20
on the fact of the dry-season greening of the forest, but on deciphering if this greening is 21
more intense during drought years or not [6,15]. Later, it has been suggested that the 22
observed greening during the dry season in the Amazon could be attributed to artefact 23
of sun-sensor geometry [16,17]. However, a new version of EVI supports the dry season 24
greening in the Amazon [4,18]. This EVI is corrected for the sun-sensor artefact from 25
the multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction algorithm (MAIAC) [19]. 26
Furthermore, a recent analysis of seasonal canopy leaf area index (LAI) changes 27
estimated from independent lidar-based satellite observations over the Amazon forest 28
fully supports the existence of the greening [20]. 29
While the biophysical interpretation of EVI increase remains to be fully assessed [21], 30
recent accumulation of evidences in the Amazon converge to a positive correlation of 31
EVI increase and leaf flushing. This have been observed with different types of field 32
data such as percentage of trees with new leaves [18,22,23], green crown fraction 33
measured above the canopy with camera [8], indirect estimation of leaf flush with 34
litterfall [24,25], leaf spectral reflectance measurements [26] and remote-sensed changes 35
of lidar-derived canopy leaf area index (LAI) [20]. 36
The observations of leaf-flushing during the dry season challenge our vision of 37
droughts in tropical forests. The droughts may have negative impact on the forest 38
structure and dynamics [27], such as increase in mortality [28,29] or reduction of tree 39
radial growth [25]. Furthermore, tropical trees show at some extent adaptation to 40
drought with leaf water potential at wilting point ranging from -1.4 to -3.2 MPa [30]. 41
But, in case of water stress, a common behavior of the trees is to shed the leaves, as 42
observed in dry tropical forest [31]. This indicates that leaf-flushing in the heart of the 43
dry season necessarily implies a sufficient supply of water. Above 2000 mm of annual 44
precipitation, global tropical forests maintain evergreen state and present the increase of 45
the photosynthetic capacity | the greening | during the driest season [11]. These 46
forests, whose canopies' processes are observed using remote sensing, are not limited by 47
water; they satisfy their water demands during the dry season using the supply of 48
redistributed subsurface water of the wet season [11]. Despite the leaf phenology of 49
Amazonian forests appears driven by sun-related variables and shows greening during 50
dry seasons, an analysis of the potential drivers in a continuous spatial framework is 51
still missing [4,5,9,20]. 52
To investigate the Amazon seasonality, we model the period of increase in leaf 53
production, proxied by the main period of increasing remotely sensed Enhanced 54
Vegetation Index (EVI) [14,32], with the seasonal increase of the potential climate 55
drivers, i.e.precipitation and insolation (proxied by maximal temperature, S1 Fig). We 56
assume that EVI ""greening"" relates to seasonal flush of new leaves based on recent 57
evidences obtained in Amazonia [8,20,22,23,26]. EVI values were computed from the 58
multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction algorithm (MAIAC) [19]. We 59
PLOS 2/19used EVI normalized to a nadir view angle and 45sun zenith angle to avoid artifacts 60
from changing sun-sensor geometry over time. 61
Materials and Methods 62
Satellite greenness from MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index 63
(MAIAC EVI) 64
We used enhanced vegetation index (EVI) imagery obtained by the Moderate 65
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, on board the Terra and Aqua 66
satellites (EOS AM, NASA) [33]. Data were processed with multiangle implementation 67
of atmospheric correction algorithm (MAIAC) [19]. Data were obtained for 12 MODIS 68
tiles (h10v08 to h13v10, spanning 10N to 20S in latitude and 80W to 40W in 69
longitude) from NASA's Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System 70
(LAADS Web: ftp://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/MAIAC). MAIAC observations are based 71
on MODIS Collection 6 Level 1B (calibrated and geometrically corrected) observations, 72
which removed major sensor calibration degradation effects present in earlier collections. 73
We used observations from the Terra and Aqua satellites collected between 2000 and 74
2012 at 1-km spatial resolution. EVI data were corrected for bidirectional reflectance 75
effects by normalizing all observations to a fixed sun sensor geometry (solar zenith angle 76
of 45and nadir view angle) [19]. Advanced cloud detection and aerosol-surface 77
retrieval in MAIAC improves the accuracy of satellite-based surface reflectances over 78
tropical vegetation 3 to 10 fold compared with the standard MODIS products [34]. 79
Climate measurements 80
Precipitation measurements were obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring 81
Mission (TRMM) 3B43V7 product, which provides monthly precipitation estimates at 82
0.25spatial resolution, for the tropical and subtropical regions. We analyzed data from 83
2000 to 2013. Maximal temperature ( tmx,C) was obtained from monthly climate 84
global dataset (CRU-TS3.21) available at 0.5spatial resolution, from 1901{2012, 85
produced by the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia [35]. 86
Additionally, we used monthly incoming solar radiation at the surface ( rad, W.m"
