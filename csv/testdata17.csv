ABSTRACT
Simulations of the preindustrial and doubled CO 2climates are made with the GISS Global Climate Middle
Atmosphere Model 3 using two different estimates of the absolute solar irradiance value: a higher value
measured by solar radiometers in the 1990s and a lower value measured recently by the Solar Radiation and
Climate Experiment. Each of the model simulations is adjusted to achieve global energy balance; without thisadjustment the difference in irradiance produces a global temperature change of 0.4 8C, comparable to the
cooling estimated for the Maunder Minimum. The results indicate that by altering cloud cover the model
properly compensates for the different absolute solar irradiance values on a global level when simulating both
preindustrial and doubled CO
2climates. On a regional level, the preindustrial climate simulations and the
patterns of change with doubled CO 2concentrations are again remarkably similar, but there are some dif-
ferences. Using a higher absolute solar irradiance value and the requisite cloud cover affects the model’s
depictions of high-latitude surface air temperature, sea level pressure, and stratospheric ozone, as well astropical precipitation. In the climate change experiments it leads to an underestimation of North Atlanticwarming, reduced precipitation in the tropical western Paciﬁc, and smaller total ozone growth at high
northern latitudes. Although signiﬁcant, these differences are typically modest compared with the magnitude
of the regional changes expected for doubled greenhouse gas concentrations. Nevertheless, the model sim-ulations demonstrate that achieving the highest possible ﬁdelity when simulating regional climate changerequires that climate models use as input the most accurate (lower) solar irradiance value.
1. Introduction
The sun’s energy is the primary determinant of the
earth’s climate, which changes when there is an imbal-ance between incoming solar energy (at near-ultraviolet
and visible wavelengths) and outgoing terrestrial energy
(at infrared wavelengths). Measurements made by theTotal Irradiance Monitor (TIM) on the Solar Radiationand Climate Experiment (SORCE) (Rottman et al.2005) indicate that the total solar irradiance (TSI)is;1361.3 W m
22(Kopp and Lean 2011), which pro-
vides incoming solar energy of 340 W m22averaged over
the whole earth. The TSI that TIM measures is ;6Wm22
lower than the canonical value of 1367 W m22that many
climate models presently use (Kopp and Lean 2011) andsome 15 W m
22less than initial space-based measure-
ment, made by the Nimbus-7 spacecraft, of 1376 W m22
(Hickey et al. 1980). Extensive laboratory calibration
and assessment establish the lowest of these values as
the most accurate and most likely absolute value of total
solar irradiance.
Reducing total solar irradiance by 6 W m22(;0.4%)
reduces incoming solar energy by 1.5 W m22(the irra-
diance spread over the surface of the earth) and ab-sorbed solar radiation by a little over 1 W m

the solar irradiance value produces an equivalent un-certainty in the earth’s energy balance (the differencebetween incoming and outgoing radiation) that is largerin magnitude than the earth’s current energy imbalance,which climate models estimate to be less than 1 W m
22
(Loeb et al. 2012). An imbalance in the earth’s present-
day incoming (solar) and outgoing (terrestrial) energy is
a harbinger of unrealized climate forcing that may con-
tribute to future climate change.
We investigate the difference that using the new lower
absolute value of total solar irradiance makes in generalcirculation model climate simulations, such as those usedin the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) reports. Were the sun’s total solar irradianceto actually change by 6 W m
22, the resultant climate
forcing of ;1Wm22[assuming climate sensitivity of
0.78C( W m22)21forcing] would be comparable to the
forcing by increasing CO 2concentrations in the industrial
era since 1850 (about 60% of the estimated greenhouse gasforcing). The temperature change that such a decrease
induces is highly signiﬁca nt, with a global value of 20.438C
and regional changes shown in Fig. 1. Coincidentally, suchchanges are of similar magni tude to the climate response
simulated for prescribed solar irradiance change fromthe Maunder Minimum of anomalously low solar activity

duction of 6 W m22does not represent a change over
time. Rather, it is a more accurate estimate of the TSIabsolute value; the change with time that has beenmeasured during the 11-yr solar cycle is a factor of5s m a l l e r ,o fo r d e r1 W m
22. The investigation here,
which is the ﬁrst of its kind, explores the impact thatuncertainty in the absolute level of solar radiation has
on the current (or more precisely the preindustrial)
climate and on climate change simulations.
Climate models used for simulating anthropogenic
climate change are ‘‘calibrated’’ to ensure that theglobal-mean net radiation at the top of the atmosphere,and hence the net heating at the surface, is small. Thisradiation balance is implemented in simulations ofpreindustrial climate against which climate forced sce-
narios are then referenced. In the absence of such
a calibration, the model’s energy imbalance forces oceantemperatures to depart from observed conditions with-out any climate forcing, producing spurious climatetrends. Individual climate models employ a variety ofprocedures to achieve this radiation balance (Solomonet al. 2007, p. 596) but most approaches involve cloud orconvective parameterizations. For example, Goddard
Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Model E tunes the
threshold relative humidity for the initiation of ice andwater clouds to achieve global radiative balance (i.e., netradiation at the TOA within 60.5 W m
22of zero) and
a reasonable planetary albedo (between 29% and 31%)for the 1 3CO
2simulations (Schmidt et al. 2006, p. 163).
It is because of this model ‘‘calibration’’ that differencesin the absolute value of total solar irradiance that vari-
ous models use are assumed not to impact their simu-
lations of climate change.
To test this assumption, we investigate differences in
climate speciﬁcation and climate change that the lower,more accurate, TSI value of 1361.3 W m
22makes rela-
tive to the higher value of 1367.0 W m22.W es i m u l a t et h e
preindustrial climate and a climate with doubled CO 2
concentrations (2 3CO 2) using the coupled atmosphere–
ocean model described in the following section, as well as
speciﬁed preindustrial sea surface temperatures (SSTs)and sea ice [updated from Hurrell et al. (2008) for phase5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project(CMIP5), provided by the Hadley Centre].
2. Climate model and procedures
The GISS Global Climate Middle Atmosphere Model
3 (Rind et al. 2007), which we refer to as Model 3, hasbeen employed for many experiments involving increasedatmospheric CO
2concentrations, solar irradiance varia-
tions (Rind et al. 2008), and paleoclimate simulations.The model includes a full middle atmosphere (top at
;85 km) and is coupled to the Russell et al. (1995) ocean
model, which is similar to the ocean model used in theGISS–IPCC ‘‘Er’’ experiments (Schmidt et al. 2006).When Model 3 is run with doubled atmospheric CO
2
concentrations to equilibrium in a ‘‘ qﬂux’’ mode, it has
a sensitivity of about 2.8 8C [0.78C( Wm22)21] (note that
theq-ﬂux mode is not used in these experiments).
The version of Model 3 that we use here has
48latitude 358longitude resolution and 23 vertical
atmospheric layers. Climate simulations are made usingeither the dynamical ocean or speciﬁed SSTs and sea ice(for preindustrial times, 1876–85, available from theHadley Centre at http://www.metofﬁce.gov.uk/hadobs/hadsst3/). Since the model covers the full middle atmo-sphere, a difference in the level of solar radiation input
to the model affects solar absorption at higher altitudes
near the stratopause as well as in the troposphere. Alinearized ozone photochemistry scheme (McLindenet al. 2000) is employed in the stratosphere to morefully assess the impact of different solar irradiancelevels in this region and to calculate ozone directly,while a simpliﬁed ozone photochemical scheme adaptedfrom the Goddard Earth Observing System chemical
transport model (GEOS-Chem) results is used in the
troposphere (Rind et al. 2007).
Similar to all GISS models, Model 3, like Model E,
achieves approximate radiative balance (in 1 3CO
2runs,
i.e., with no external climate forcing) by adjusting itsparameterization of cloud formation. The GISS models,including Model 3, derive clouds via a probabilistic rep-resentation of the chance of forming a cloud compared
with the relative humidity speciﬁed for the particular
model gridbox and atmospheric layer (Yao and DelGenio 1999). In practice, the relative humidity is com-pared with a random number (from a random numbergenerator) at each time step; a cloud is allocated to ﬁll thegrid box when its relative humidity exceeds the randomn u m b e r .H o w e v e r ,w h i l et h ec h a n c eo fg e t t i n gac l o u di smuch greater with a relative humidity of 90% than 10%,
there is no certainty in either case. When a cloud is
deemed present, it is presumed to occupy 100% of thegrid box for that atmospheric level; otherwise, there is0% cloud cover in that level. On a monthly average, thisfull cloud cover in each grid box occurring part of thetime produces a similar radiative response to calculat-ing partial cloud cover in the grid box all of the time(A. Lacis 2013, personal communication), for which the
random number could also have been used.
In Model 3, the tuning parameter of choice for in-
vestigating the impact of different solar irradiance valuesis the initial relative humidity at which the calculation isbegun. Since even a 10% relative humidity occasionally1102 JOURNAL OF CLIMATE V OLUME 27produces a cloud with this scheme, the lower the relative
humidity at which the procedure is initiated, the greaterthe cloud cover. Observations do not indicate with anygreat precision what the relationship between relativehumidity and cloud formation should be, and it is likelyto be situation dependent. Nevertheless, this approachproduces the broad representation of cloud cover seenin various datasets (e.g., Schmidt et al. 2006). As noted
above, from Schmidt et al., the procedure is not entirely
without an overall constraint as observations do indicatethat the model planetary albedo should be ;30%.
Clouds can have both positive and negative effects on
the earth’s radiation balance, but in general the greaterthe cloud cover the larger the atmospheric and planetaryalbedos, the smaller the solar energy present in the cli-mate system. This is evident in both observations [e.g.,
Kiehl and Trenberth (1997), who found clouds produce
an e tc o o l i n go f 220 W m
22] and models [Solomon
et al. (2007, p. 768) where the global annual mean effectof cloud cover averaged over all models for 1980–99 is222.3 W m
22]. Thus, in the Model 3 simulations, changing
the incoming absolute solar irradiance value requires thatthe initial relative humidity for starting the cloud cal-culation also be changed to maintain radiative balance.
Speciﬁcally, when substituting a total solar irradiance
value of 1361.3 for 1367.0 W m
22the initial relative hu-
midity is raised from 82.7% to 83.1%, which reduces theglobal cloud cover from 58.3% to 57.8% and admits moresolar radiation to the earth system, thereby compensatingfor reducing the incident energy value spread over theearth from 341.8 to 340.4 W m
22. In the simulations made
using speciﬁed sea surface temperatures and sea ice for
the two solar irradiance values, the compensatory initial
relative humidity for cloud formation changed from81.45% for TSI 51367.0 to 81.97% for TSI 51361.3.
Changing the cloud cover in a climate model affects
multiple aspects of the climate system and potentiallyimpacts climate sensitivity as well. Furthermore, achiev-ing a new radiation balance on a global basis does notnecessarily preclude local radiation imbalances, which
may well differ for different amounts of incoming solar
radiant energy; for example, in regions where cloudcover is absent in either case, higher incident solar ra-diation deposits more energy at the surface. To assessthe consequences of different levels of incident solar ra-diation, we performed a suite of experiments, summa-rized in Table 1, with two different values of TSI each fortwo different levels of atmospheric CO
2concentrations,
corresponding to preindustrial (270 ppm) and doubled
CO 2(540 ppm) conditions.
Radiation balance is achieved as described above for
each of the four simulations identiﬁed as runs 1 and 2(made with a dynamic ocean) and runs 1S and 2S (madewith speciﬁed sea surface temperatures), in Table 1, by
adjusting the cloud formation probability to make thenet radiation at the top of the atmosphere and at thesurface approximately zero. We then assess (section 3)the model outputs to determine whether the simulationsmade with two different absolute solar irradiance valuesand their corresponding cloud coverage differ notice-ably in their speciﬁcation of the present-day climate
(recognizing that differences between the preindustrial
and current climate atmospheric conditions will existwith both irradiance values). If so, are these differencesassociated with atmosphere–ocean interactions (runs 1and 2), or do they exist even with the same (speciﬁed)preindustrial sea surface temperatures (runs 1S and 2S)?In section 4, we investigate whether the different modelconﬁgurations associated with the two different solar
irradiance values produce different climate sensitivities
or change any characteristics of the climate system sim-ulated with doubled levels of CO
2(runs 3 and 4). We also
assess how much of the differences are associated with theatmosphere–ocean interaction versus the atmosphere–land response alone (runs 3S and 4S) by using the samespeciﬁed SSTs and sea ice in each run, obtained from thelast 100 years of run 3.
All Model 3 simulations made using the coupled dy-
namical ocean, both for preindustrial (270 ppm) anddoubled (540 ppm) CO
2concentrations (runs 1, 2, 3, and
4 in Table 1), were extended for 500 years. Although thistime is insufﬁcient to achieve true equilibrium, the at-mospheric climate parameters are relatively stable longbefore 500 years; the results given in Table 2 are aver-ages over model simulation years 100–500. The changes
from these numbers for averages of just the last 100 years
are shown in parenthesis, and they indicate little dif-ference from the 400-yr averaging, emphasizing thestability of the results. Because the speciﬁed SST runs(1S, 2S, 3S, and 4S) have much less variability or trend,TABLE 1. Input parameters and GISS Model 3 conﬁgurations

As noted above, the model conﬁguration includes
ozone calculations in the stratosphere, so reducing thesolar irradiance value also reduces the ultraviolet (UV)portion of the spectrum that affects ozone. Since not allclimate models incorporate online chemistry calcula-tions, often using prescribed ozone instead, this portionof the ‘‘adjustment’’ to solar irradiance may not alwaysbe applicable. To test its impact, additional 500-yr runs
with the lower solar irradiance value were made without
altering the UV irradiance for the ozone calculation(run 2oz). Most of the tropospheric responses werecomparable but, as expected, signiﬁcant stratosphericconsequences arose and are described.
3. Preindustrial simulations
Listed in Table 2 are global annual diagnostics from
the Model 3 runs made using the dynamic ocean. Theﬁrst two columns correspond to the preindustrial (1 3
CO
2) simulations using, respectively, the standard GISS
model solar irradiance value of 1367.0 W m22, run 1(column 1), and an alternate value of 1361.3 W m22, run
2 (column 2), indicative of the SORCE lower value,
which is the more probable true level of the sun’s irra-
diance. Results are 400-yr averages (from year 101 to500) and, in parenthesis, the difference of the 400-yraverage from the average over only the last 100 yr; thatthe differences are quite small indicates that the modelswere in equilibrium over the 400-yr time frame. In thesimulations made with the lower solar irradiance value(column 2), the low-level cloud cover is 48.1%, reduced
from 48.6%, and the planetary albedo is 30.71, reduced
from 30.92. Owing to this compensating change, the netradiation at the top of the atmosphere, and the net heatat the surface, differ by less than 0.1 W m
22when using
the lower solar irradiance value, with incoming andoutgoing radiation amounts that differ by 0.2–0.3 W m
22.
The global, annual average surface air temperature andintegrated atmospheric temperatures are about 0.1 8C
cooler in the run with the lower solar irradiance, and
there is a corresponding small reduction in the watervalue amount in the atmosphere, as well as a slight in-crease in snow cover. Despite cloud cover differences, thegreenhouse efﬁciency of the atmosphere is essentiallyTABLE 2. Global annual averages for years 101–500 of the Model 3 simulations.

differences from the 400-yr averages obtained when averaging over just the last 100 years.

compensation largely eradicates the impact of usingdifferent solar irradiance values in the Model 3 speciﬁ-cation of the preindustrial climate.
Differences in regional climate speciﬁed with the two
different values of solar irradiance can be somewhat
larger than the global differences even with the Model 3
radiation budget parameters nominally calibrated tohave zero difference globally. Shown in Fig. 2 are 400-yrannual-averaged differences determined as run 1 (highersolar irradiance) minus run 2 (lower solar irradiance) fornet radiation at the surface (Fig. 2a), total cloud cover
(Fig. 2b), and planetary albedo (Fig. 2c). Also shown onthe right side of the ﬁgures are the zonal averages ofthese differences, for both the last 100 yr (model years401–500, dashed line) and 400 yr (model years 101–500,solid line) of the simulations. The net radiation at the
surface (Fig. 2a) is of mixed sign, with a tendency for
greater radiation at the surface at high latitudes and lessin the tropics. This is a direct result of the different cloudcover parameterizations (Fig. 2b) with total (and low)cloud cover a few percent higher (in absolute terms) in

The surface energy differences also affect the sea ice
distribution with notably less sea ice around most of
Antarctica associated with the greater positive surfaceradiation that accompanies the higher absolute value ofsolar irradiance. The planetary albedo differences (Fig.2c) reﬂect the cloud and surface responses, with re-ductions of up to 1% (absolute) where sea ice and cloudsare both diminished and increases of up to 1% wheretropical cloud cover has increased.
Unfortunately, cloud cover observations are not sufﬁ-
ciently constrained for us to assess whether the differencesnecessitated by altering cloud cover to accommodate thereduced solar insolation makes Model 3 more or lessaccurate in that respect. The differences shown in Fig. 2are of order 1%, and International Satellite Cloud Cli-
matology Project cloud observations on a monthly av-
erage are accurate to only 3% (http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/
index.html). Similarly, the difference in net radiation atthe surface is less than 2 W m
22, while ISCCP errors are
;15 W m22. The following section provides additional
comparisons with other observations.
Regional impacts of different TSI values are also ev-
ident in other Model 3 climate parameters, which Fig. 3illustrates. Shown are the differences in surface air
temperature (Fig. 3a), sea level pressure (Fig. 3b), and
precipitation (Fig. 3c), which are similarly determined asrun 1 (higher solar irradiance) minus run 2 (lower solarirradiance). Sea level pressure is less at higher latitudeswhere the air has been made less stable owing to more

level pressure, and (c) precipitation.1106 JOURNAL OF CLIMATE V OLUME 27surface radiative forcing and greater surface air tem-
perature, with minimal differences in the tropics. Manyof the temperature differences arise from advectivechanges associated with altered wind ﬂow due to the sealevel pressure response. Higher temperatures also occurin the regions of sea ice reduction, especially aroundAntarctica.
In addition to these latitudinal differences, when using
the higher solar irradiance value there is also a general
tendency for Model 3 to preferentially reduce pre-cipitation over the oceans and increase it over land, asevident in Fig. 3c (the ratio of precipitation over land tothat over the ocean grows by about 1%). Certain landregions have little cloud cover to begin with, and thus the
reduced cloud cover needed to calibrate the model forthe lower values of solar irradiance has little effect.Without altered cloud cover the net radiation at thesurface (driven by net solar radiation at the top of theatmosphere) tends to be larger when using the higherabsolute solar irradiance value (e.g., the Sahara, Fig. 2a).This leads to relative ascent over land with corresponding
subsidence over the ocean and consequent precipitation
anomalies. The signiﬁcance of each of these differences isdiscussed below in comparison with the standard errors inthe mean values of the 1 3CO
2run (run 1), which are
shown in Fig. 4.

and the standard error in the mean values (Fig. 5b).Most notable is an overestimation of a few Dobsonunits (DU) in the total column ozone at high northernlatitudes when using the higher solar irradiance value,a difference that is about ﬁve times larger than thestandard error in the model’s mean values. In general,with the higher value of total solar irradiance, Model 3
produces larger atmospheric temperatures at all levels
in the troposphere and stratosphere, of order 0.15 8C
relative to the lower irradiance level. Figure 6a showsthe differences in the vertical proﬁle of the zonally aver-aged temperature. The simulated warmer conditions bythemselves lead to a reduction of ozone concentrations ingeneral (0.03% DU decrease) in the experiment in whichUV spectral irradiance remained unchanged (run 2oz), as
shown in Fig. 6b. However, when the UV irradiance is
also reduced, consistent with SORCE’s overall lowertotal solar irradiance value, using the higher solar(and UV) irradiance produces higher ozone levels atmost locations in the stratosphere by 1.3 DU overall(Table 1), because of larger (by 0.5%) photochemical
production. Figure 6c shows the corresponding differ-ences at different altitudes. Poleward transport is alsooverestimated (by 0.5%–1%) in both hemispheres, pri-
marily associated with the increased atmospheric loading.
Figure 6d shows that these dynamical differences arelarger and located farther poleward in the NorthernHemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere, as evidentin the resultant distribution (Fig. 5a). The result of theoverestimated temperature, photochemistry, and dy-namics is an overestimate by some 4 Dobson units (1%)of the total column ozone at high northern latitudes when
using the higher solar irradiance value.
Most of the climate speciﬁcation differences depicted
above, while understandable (and reproducible in thesimulations with no solar UV spectrum changes for ozonephotochemistry), are small. Differences in global annualaverages are not statistically signiﬁcant by comparisonwith the standard deviations of the model runs. There-fore, the procedure by which net radiation balance is
assured with the differing solar irradiance values proves
to be sufﬁcient to minimize differences in the Model3 global annual-average sim ulations of preindustrial
climate, at least from the perspective of the model’sinherent variability.

averages are shown on the right.1108 JOURNAL OF CLIMATE V OLUME 27In speciﬁc regions the differences can, however, reach
signiﬁcant levels, even though compensating tendenciesminimize the global average changes. Figure 4 shows the
regional distribution of the standard error (the stan-
dard deviation divided by the square root of the samplesize) in run 1 (for simulation years 100–500) for totalclouds (Fig. 4a), surface air temperature (Fig. 4b), sealevel pressure (Fig. 4c), precipitation (Fig. 4d), andtotal ozone (Fig. 5b). These indicate the Model 3 in-herent variability. Differences in the radiation budgetand climate parameters shown in Figs. 1 and 2 for two
different solar irradiance values are signiﬁcant at the
95% level when they are larger than twice the standarderror of their 1 3CO
2simulations shown in Fig. 4. This
is true for tropical cloud cover differences (Fig. 2bcompared with Fig. 4a), high-latitude surface air
temperature differences (Fig. 3a compared with Fig.
4b), and sea level pressure differences (Fig. 3b com-pared with Fig. 4c). Regional precipitation differencesare comparable to, or only marginally larger than, thestandard error in the 1 3CO
2run (Fig. 3c compared with
Fig. 4d). The impact of using different input solar ir-radiance values is especially evident on the Model 3speciﬁcation of total ozone, where high-latitude dif-
ferences on the order of 4 DU (Fig. 5a) exceed, by
a factor of 5 or more, the standard error (Fig. 5b).

point in their development, to shorten the simulationtime when investigating different approaches to atmo-spheric physics and numerical parameterizations. SSTs
are also speciﬁed when calibrating parameterizations to
produce near-zero net radiation balance for the currentclimate (e.g., Schmidt et al. 2006). So the impact thata change in total solar irradiance has on that conﬁgu-ration is also of interest. With the additional simulationsdesignated runs 1S, 2S, 3S, and 4S in Table 1, we in-vestigate what proportion of the differences results fromthe interaction of the atmosphere and ocean via the
coupled models compared with that generated simply by
the effect of the altered solar irradiance and cloud coveron the atmosphere–land system. Runs 1S and 2S bothused the same speciﬁed preindustrial sea surface tem-peratures and sea ice and were assessed similarly to theresults shown in the Figs. 2, 3, and 5 (which used a dy-namic ocean). These additional simulations (not shown)using speciﬁed SSTs indicate that differences in cloud
cover, planetary albedo, and net radiation at the surface
over the tropical oceans (Figs. 2b,c) are also present whenthe sea surface temperatures are speciﬁed. This suggeststhat these differences are independent of ocean in-teraction; they are actually slightly reduced in magni-tude with the coupled ocean response. In contrast,differences in the vicinity of Antarctica are the result ofatmosphere–ocean interactions via effects of the dy-
namic ocean sea ice change. Differences in surface air
temperature over land for the most part occur withoutan ocean response, while those over the ocean (includinghigh northern latitudes) require it. Correspondingly, dif-ferences in sea level pressure are greatly affected by theocean thermal response over the ocean, while differences
over land (including Antarctica) are similar in both sets ofruns (i.e., with the dynamic ocean and with speciﬁed seasurface temperatures). Tropical precipitation differ-
ences are quite distinct in the simulations made with and
without ocean feedbacks, as they are inﬂuenced by cir-culation changes induced by land–ocean temperaturegradients. In the stratosphere the ozone differences (Fig.5) do not feel much inﬂuence from the dynamic ocean,especially in the polar regions. We conclude, therefore,that a number of the differences induced by altered solarradiation and cloud cover maintain their characteristic
nature regardless of whether the ocean responds (so
would be apparent in AMIP style runs), especially awayfrom extratropical oceanic regions.
4. Model validation
We compare the simulations of the preindustrial cli-
mate made using two different input total solar irradiance
values with current observations. For the global average
radiation parameters listed in Table 2 the differences aregenerally too small to provide a clear indication ofpreference relative to current observations. We com-pare in Table 3 global annual averages of three metrics,each calculated on the 4 8latitude 358longitude grid—
speciﬁcally the mean biases (mean), root-mean-squarebiases (RMS), and spatial correlation coefﬁcient (SCC,
calculated using the Moran coefﬁcient)—to statistically
compare the two preindustrial simulations with obser-vations of temperature, precipitation and sea levelpressure. Table 3 lists the average comparison of theModel 3 simulations with the observational datasets; theTABLE 3. Comparison of Model 3 climate simulations with observations at the gridbox level. Listed are the averages (and in parentheses
the standard deviations) of the mean, root-mean-square difference, and serial correlation coefﬁcient of the simulations and selectedobservational datasets.

The smaller the difference in themeans and rms values and the larger the SCC, the betterthe model reproduction of the observations.
As the values in Table 3 indicate for all three climate
parameters considered, the differences in the Model 3simulations using different absolute solar irradiancevalues are very small, generally less than the standarddeviations of the model’s comparisons with the differentobservational datasets. Hence, for these parameters, asfor the radiative values, the compensation approachused to adjust for the different solar radiation value that
Model 3 uses produces 1 3CO
2simulations that are
practically indistinguishable.
We also compare with current climate observations
the simulations made using speciﬁed (preindustrial) seasurface temperatures and sea ice. As might be expectedfor most of the parameters listed in Table 2, differenceswhen using total solar irradiance values of 1361.3 and1367.0 W m
22are even less when the SSTs are speciﬁed
(which is why their radiative results are not given in
Table 2). Table 3 gives the relationship to observationsof these simulations made with the two solar irradiancevalues and compensatory change of initial relative hu-midity for cloud formation. As with the simulations us-ing a dynamic ocean, there is minimal difference in therelationship to observations between the two runs madeusing speciﬁed sea surface temperatures. As expected,
most of the comparisons improve slightly with speciﬁed
SSTs (smaller mean and RMS differences, higher SCC).For example, the RMS temperature bias is reduced by25% when speciﬁed SSTs are used. Note also that part ofthe error in both sets of simulations (dynamical oceanand speciﬁed SSTs) is because the comparisons pertainto simulations of preindustrial climate with currentconditions; for example, when run with speciﬁed mod-
ern SSTs, the mean temperature error is only half as
large and the RMS error is (further) reduced by 10%–15%. The conclusion is then the same as in the previoussection: compensation for using different solar irradi-ance values successfully mitigates most of the effect thiswould have on the 1 3CO
2simulation, at least in com-
parison with present uncertainties in observed climate,even though some of the differences are larger than themodel’s inherent variability.
5. Climate sensitivity and change
In this section, we investigate how the two different
absolute solar irradiance values and their corresponding
cloud cover adjustments affect the Model 3 climatesensitivity and simulation of anthropogenic climatechange. To address this, as indicated earlier, additionalsimulations were made (runs 3 and 4 in Table 1) in whichthe CO
2concentrations were instantaneously doubled
and the model run for 500 years with the coupled ocean(the simulations were actually begun some 100 years
after the 1 3CO
2run started and appeared to have sta-
bilized). Columns 3 and 4 of Table 2 give the globalannual-average results.
Considering ﬁrst the 2 3CO
2experiments themselves,
the differences between them directly (run 3 versus run4) are visually very similar to the differences in the13CO
2simulations (shown in Figs. 2 and 3), although at
times with somewhat muted amplitude. So the bias that
a different solar irradiance level introduces to the
13CO 2runs carries over, qualitatively at least, into the
climate change simulations.
Although qualitatively quite similar, changes in cli-
mate simulated using two different absolute solar irra-diance values are not identical. To understand how thevalue of solar radiation in the preindustrial simulationsimpacts climate change assessments, we compare the
23CO
2minus 1 3CO 2climate change for the two dif-
ferent solar irradiance values (i.e., we compare run 3minus run 1, indicative of anthropogenic climate changewith the higher solar irradiance value, with run 4 minusrun 2, indicate of anthropogenic climate change with thelower, more probable total irradiance value).
Both Model 3 simulations (i.e., using the two different
total solar irradiance values) made with 2 3CO
2remain
out of radiation balance for the duration of the runs, by
0.7 W m22. As noted earlier, the Model 3 doubled CO 2
sensitivity (when run with a q-ﬂux ocean, not in these
experiments) is 2.8 8C for;4Wm22radiative forcing, so
the imbalance would result in projected additionalwarming of ;0.58C. The doubled CO
2warming with the
dynamic ocean at the end of 500 yr for the higher solarirradiance is 2.51 8C, the same as with the lower value.
Hence, the compensation for the altered solar irradiance
does not change climate sensitivity on a global basis.
We next consider how the patterns of climate change
for doubled CO
2concentrations differ. Shown in the top
panels of Figs. 7–11 are the changes in total cloud cover1FEBRUARY 2014 R I N D E T A L . 1111(Fig. 7), surface air temperature (Fig. 8), sea level
pressure (Fig. 9), precipitation (Fig. 10), and total ozone(Fig. 11), for the 2 3CO
2minus 1 3CO 2climate change
simulations using the higher solar irradiance value(1367.0 W m
22). For comparison, the middle panels in
each of the ﬁve ﬁgures show the corresponding changesusing the lower solar irradiance value (1361.3 W m
22),
and in the bottom panels are the differences between the
top and middle panels, that is, (run 3 minus run 1) minus
(run 4 minus run 2). In each case, the patterns in the toppanel and the middle panel are visually quite similar sothat, at least qualitatively, the Model 3 parameterizedcompensation for different absolute solar irradiancevalues successfully mitigates differences in simulated
climate change.
Total cloud cover increases in some regions and de-
creases in others as climate changes in response to23CO
2, by up to 6% (Figs. 7a,b). The overall pattern of
cloud cover response, irrespective of the solar irradiancevalue, is associated with increased upward motion in thetropics, owing to greater latent heat release as the cli-
mate warms in response to increasing greenhouse gas
concentrations; subsidence increases in the subtropicsand midlatitudes. Many anthropogenic warming exper-iments demonstrate this response (e.g., Solomon et al.2007, Fig. 10.10), which is a combination of an expanded

the changes [(a) minus (b)]. Zonal averages are shown on the right.1112 JOURNAL OF CLIMATE V OLUME 27Hadley Cell inﬂuence and reduced extratropical storm
intensity owing to reduced temperature gradients (higherlatitudes warm more than lower latitudes). With a higher
solar irradiance value, Model 3 underestimates the in-
crease in cloud cover in the eastern Paciﬁc and tropicalwestern Paciﬁc in the vicinity of Indonesia (Fig. 7c).While not negligible, these differences are generally lessthan 1% (16% relatively). They occur in regions wherecloud cover was greater in the 1 3CO
2run with the
higher solar irradiance value, so the effect of reducingsurface energy in the 1 3CO
2simulations seems to limit
the increase in the 2 3CO 2simulations.
Corresponding changes in annual surface air temper-
ature in response to doubled CO 2concentrations also
have a characteristic pattern, independent of the absolutesolar irradiance value (Figs. 8a,b), with relatively morewarming at higher latitudes and over continental regions
(e.g., Eurasia), aided by snow cover reduction, com-pared to nearby oceans. The North Atlantic warms less
than surrounding regions owing to a reduction in North
Atlantic Deep Water production and associated pole-ward ocean heat transport, again similar to many climatewarming experiments (e.g., Solomon et al. 2007, Fig.10.8). However, there is a tendency for the areas thatwere warmer in the respective 1 3CO
2simulations to
have less warming in the climate change experiment: Itwas usually warmer in the 1 3CO
2run owing to the lo-
cally reduced cloud cover needed to achieve global en-
ergy balance with the higher input solar irradiance. Partof the reason for the reduced warming with climatechange is that in these regions there is now less cloudcover to lose.
FIG. 8. As in Fig. 7, but for surface air temperature.1FEBRUARY 2014 R I N D E T A L . 1113Sea ice changes arising from the doubled CO 2con-
centrations also contribute. Where there is less sea ice inthe 13CO
2runs, less can potentially be lost, and with
the larger solar irradiance value there is less sea ice.
Differences in sea ice between the two climate changesimulations are relatively large, on the order of tens ofpercent (relatively) in both hemispheres. Using thelarger solar irradiance value results in an underestimateof North Atlantic warming, speciﬁcally, and, more gen-erally, higher-latitude warming in both hemispheres.
The sea level pressure differences resulting from dou-
bled atmospheric CO
2concentrations are shown in Figs.
9a and 9b. Both hemispheres have lower pressure athigher latitudes, irrespective of the solar irradiance value,which is an expression at the surface of more positivenorthern and southern annular modes. This response isalso a general feature of climate warming experiments
(e.g., Rind et al. 2005; Solomon et al. 2007) and is due to1) greater warming in the tropical upper troposphere
relative to extratropical latitudes, leading (from the
thermal wind relationship) to 2) increased zonal westwinds in the subtropics and hence 3) greater equator-ward planetary wave refraction, and thus 4) greaterpoleward momentum transport (e.g., Rind et al. 2005).Although the basic pattern remains the same, the effecton sea level pressure of using a larger value of solar ir-radiance (Fig. 9c) is greater reduction (less reduction) in
the Northern Hemisphere (Southern Hemisphere), as
explained below. Unlike the situation with the two13CO
2runs (Fig. 3), the advec tive differences due to
these slightly different sea level pressure responseshave only a slight inﬂuence on the resulting surface air
FIG. 9. As in Fig. 7, but for sea level pressure.1114 JOURNAL OF CLIMATE V OLUME 27temperature differences (Fig. 8), which are dominated
by the radiative responses as discussed above.
The precipitation anomalies for the double CO 2sim-
ulations, shown in Figs. 10a and 10b, although not iden-
tical on the scale of several grid boxes, are quite similarwhen using two different solar irradiance values; bothshow increased tropical upwelling and subtropical sub-sidence in response to warming from increased green-house gas concentrations (e.g., Solomon et al. 2007, Fig.10.12). The primary differences, evident in Fig. 10c, sug-gest that using the higher solar irradiance value for cli-
mate change simulations may underestimate the increase
in precipitation (as it did for cloud cover) in the easternand especially western Paciﬁc regions. Again, wherecloud cover was greater in the 1 3CO
2run, and the sur-
face energy less, the precipitation increase was limited.Total ozone column changes associated with doubled
CO 2climate change simulated using the higher and
lower solar irradiance values are shown in Figs. 11a and
11b. According to Model 3, in a warmer climate total
ozone increases in the extratropics and decreasesslightly in the tropics. The extratropical increases are theresult of accelerated ozone photochemical generationbetween 1 and 10 mb associated with colder strato-spheric temperatures, as in this region the increasedCO
2concentrations enhance radiative cooling to space.
Figure 12a illustrates the vertical proﬁle of the zonal
mean temperature change for the doubled CO 2climate,
with cooling evident everywhere above about 100 mb.Figure 12c shows the corresponding vertical proﬁle ofthe zonal mean change in ozone photochemistry. Theincreased ozone is advected poleward and downward at
FIG. 10. As in Fig. 7, but for precipitation.1FEBRUARY 2014 R I N D E T A L . 1115subtropical and polar latitudes as a result of the north-
ward and vertical transport changes shown in Figs. 13aand 13c, respectively. The increased transport is not due
simply to the greater availability of ozone but also to an
ampliﬁed stratospheric residual circulation in thewarmer climate (e.g., Rind et al. 1990), which bringsmore low ozone air from the troposphere into thetropical stratosphere, explaining the tropical response.
The differences that the absolute solar irradiance
value makes to simulations of total ozone in a warmingclimate are shown in Fig. 11c. Corresponding differences
in the vertical temperature, ozone photochemistry, and
transport changes are shown in Figs. 12b,d and 13b,d.While the spatial and vertical patterns of change are verysimilar in each of the 2 3CO
2simulations, the slightly
warmer temperatures with the higher solar irradiancevalue (0.1 8–0.28C, Fig. 6a) reduce the photochemical
productivity in the upper stratosphere (by 2% overallrelative to the standard run, Fig. 12d), lessening the
ozone increase slightly (Table 2). This deﬁcit is then
advected to the North Pole, producing the total ozonedifferences evident in Fig. 11c. Note that, in Fig. 11c,total ozone over the North Atlantic is an exception tothis general pattern since here the climate change ex-periments using higher solar irradiance produce highertotal ozone. The residual circulation actually strengthensabout 10% more in the 2 3CO
2simulation made with the
higher solar irradiance value, as can be seen by noting
that the changes in ozone vertical transport (Fig. 13d) areof roughly the same structure as the D23CO
2transports
[Fig. 13c, increased downward (upward) transport wherethere was relative downward (upward) transport in the
FIG. 11. As in Fig. 7, but for total ozone.1116 JOURNAL OF CLIMATE V OLUME 27climate change run], and this occurs despite the overall
reduced photochemical generation. Nevertheless, thepoleward transport change in the 2 3CO
2simulation
results in relatively greater ozone convergence in thisregion (Fig. 13b; ;668N, 100–10 mb), overcoming the
production deﬁcit.
The underestimate of ozone in the Northern Hemi-
sphere polar lower stratosphere when using the higher
solar irradiance value results in relatively colder tem-peratures in the 2 3CO
2climate (Fig. 12b), which re-
duces the tropospheric stability in that region. This isthen responsible for the relatively reduced sea levelpressure (Fig. 9c). Note that a similar effect does not
occur over the Southern Hemisphere pole—not the re-duced ozone, the colder polar lower stratosphere tem-peratures, nor the lower sea level pressure.
How signiﬁcant are differences in the doubled CO
2
climate change scenarios simulated using two differentabsolute values of solar irradiance? To assess this, we
compare the ‘‘difference of the differences’’ in total
cloud cover, surface air temperature, sea level pressure,precipitation, and total ozone (Figs. 7c, 8c, 9c, 10c, and11c) with the standard errors of average values of thesimulations (Figs. 4 and 5b). We note that the difference
FIG. 12. Zonal average altitude proﬁles of the year 101–500 changes in two simulations of climate change for
doubled CO 2concentrations made using two different solar irradiance values: (a) the average temperature changes
and (b) the differences of the temperature changes; (c) the average changes in net photochemical production ofozone and (d) the differences of the net photochemical production changes.1F
EBRUARY 2014 R I N D E T A L . 1117of the differences deemed statistically signiﬁcant are
often just the more extreme aspects of a pattern of
response.
A comparison of Figs. 7c and 4a indicates that, where
total cloud cover changes are large, they are likely sig-niﬁcant. So, for example, in tropical regions differencesof 1% pertaining to the two different solar irradiancevalues (Fig. 7c) are likely signiﬁcant, being a factor of5 or so larger than the standard error in the mean total
cloud cover (Fig. 4a). This can be compared with climate-
driven changes of ;6% (e.g., in the vicinity of Indonesia,
Figs. 7a,b).
The underestimate (by more than 0.5 8C, Fig. 8c) of
surface air temperature changes in the North Atlanticregion (50 8–708N) arising from doubled CO
2concen-
trations when using the higher solar irradiance value are
also likely signiﬁcant since the standard error in themean surface air temperature in this region is of order0.18C (Fig. 4b). The differences of similar magnitude
(0.58C) in high-latitude Southern Hemisphere climate
change using the two different irradiance values arelikely not as signiﬁcant. Similarly the Northern Hemi-sphere sea level pressure differences are more signiﬁ-
cant than are the Southern Hemisphere differences
(Figs. 9c and 4c).
As in the case of cloud cover, where precipitation
changes are large they are likely signiﬁcant (Fig. 10ccompared with Fig. 4d). For example, in the tropical
FIG. 13. As in Fig. 12, but for (a) the average changes in northward ozone transport and (b) the differences in
northward ozone transport; (c) the average changes in vertical ozone transport and (d) the differences in vertical
ozone transport.1118 JOURNAL OF CLIMATE V OLUME 27western Paciﬁc, in the vicinity of Indonesia, the result
that using higher solar irradiance likely underestimates23CO
2precipitation increases by more than 50%
(0.2 mm day21out of the 0.5 mm day21change) is likely
signiﬁcant since the standard error in the mean pre-cipitation in this region (Fig. 4d) is less than0.05 mm day
21.
Also signiﬁcant are the differences in climate-driven
ozone changes for the two different values of total solar
irradiance, shown in Fig. 11c, especially at high latitudeswhere they are a factor of 4 larger than the standarderrors in the mean shown in Fig. 5b. When simulatingtotal ozone changes for double CO
2concentrations, use
of the higher solar irradiance (1367.0 W m22) instead of
the more accurate lower level (1361.3 W m22) likely
underestimates northern high-latitude total ozone
changes by at least a few Dobson units.
As was done for the 1 3CO 2simulations with two
different solar irradiance values, we also investigate howmuch of the differences between the 2 3CO
2simulations
are due to the solar irradiance and cloud cover changesdirectly as opposed to atmosphere–ocean interactions.As noted in section 2, we use the same doubled CO
2sea
surface temperatures changes in runs 3S and 4S. The
major temperature differences in Fig. 8c, over the
northern North Atlantic and near eastern Antarctica,are not present when the sea ice and sea surface tem-perature changes are the same, nor are the patterns ofprecipitation change (Fig. 10c). These then depend pri-marily on the ocean–atmosphere interaction. The high-latitude sea level pressure and cloud cover changes, incontrast, do maintain some component of the pattern
evident in Figs. 7c and 9c. The explanation for this lies in
the stratospheric ozone response. Most of the features inFigs. 11c, 12, and 13 also appear without the sea surfacetemperature differences between the doubled CO
2
simulations; hence, the inﬂuence on the high-latitude sealevel pressure and cloud cover responses does as well.
6. Discussion and conclusions
The compensation approach that the GISS Model 3
climate model uses to adjust the energy balance fordifferent absolute solar irradiance values essentiallyeliminates the impact of these differences on the modelspeciﬁcations of most climate parameters globally. Dif-ferences in regional climate that the model simulatesusing two different values of solar irradiance, 1367.0 and
1361.3 W m
22, are understandable, repeatable, small, and
typically comparable to the model repeatability de-
rived from the standard deviations of the last 400 yearsin 500-yr runs. In a few areas, for some variables, dif-ferences are more noticeable: for example, tropicalcloud cover, high-latitude temp eratures, regional precip-
itation, and high-latitude stratospheric ozone. Especiallyfor regions away from the extratropical oceans, a numberof these differences do not depend on the atmosphere–ocean interaction.
In the Model 3 simulations of climate change arising
from doubled levels of atmospheric CO
2concentrations
determined using two different solar irradiance values,
regional differences apparent in the climate speciﬁca-
tions are ampliﬁed by the climate change perturbationand, therefore, are of somewhat more consequence.Nevertheless, even here the general patterns of changeare reproduced in both sets of simulations. Noticeableregional differences do appear in some cases for thesame climate features that showed differences in the13CO
2run: tropical cloud cover and precipitation, high-
latitude temperature, and ozone. In the tropics where
cloud cover is higher in the 1 3CO 2run, increases in
precipitation and cloud cover are more muted. Overland where cloud cover is reduced in the 1 3CO
2run,
cloud cover reductions and warming are lessened.Where sea ice is greater in the 1 3CO
2run, so is sea ice
loss and warming. For these climate change experi-ments, where sea surface temperatures and sea ice are
important (tropical precipitation, high-latitude temper-
ature response), the ocean–atmosphere interaction isnecessary; for the stratosphere, high-latitude stabilityand its effect on sea level pressure, it is not.
When using a higher value of solar irradiance, and in
particular of UV irradiance, Model 3 overestimatesozone concentrations at high northern latitudes in the13CO
2simulations. In the doubled CO 2simulations, this
produces slightly warmer stratospheric temperatures,
which reduces photochemical ozone production and(compared with a simulation with the same UV values)results in an underestimate of climate-induced totalozone increases at high northern latitudes. These resultsdo not depend on ocean–atmosphere interactions.
Given the overall uncertainty of climate change sim-
ulations for future CO
2levels, the differences reported
here do not greatly affect our overall conﬁdence (or lack
of it) in the estimated climate changes. Clearly modelsshould use the most accurate solar irradiance valueavailable, which is that measured by TIM on SORCE,but we expect that this will not substantially alter thepredictions of climate change currently being made bypresent-day models. As climate models improve theircloud parameterizations and seek higher ﬁdelity speci-
ﬁcation and forecasts of climate change on smaller re-
gional scales, the requirement for the correct absolutevalue of solar irradiance will likely increase in impor-tance. In particular, we expect that using the lower ratherthan higher value of solar irradiance in present-day1FEBRUARY 2014 R I N D E T A L . 1119coupled chemistry climate models, such as those used
in the recent Scientiﬁc Assessment of Ozone Depletion(WMO 2011), will alter somewhat their projections offuture ozone changes.
While other modeling groups likely use somewhat
different compensation techniques to ensure net radia-tion balance for preindustrial simulations, it is unlikelythat the compensation produced by the GISS procedure
would ‘‘work,’’ while others would not. Nevertheless,
a comparison with other models would be useful, if forno other reason than to highlight differences in such‘‘compensation’’ techniques and how they may propa-gate uncertainties in simulations of future climate.
