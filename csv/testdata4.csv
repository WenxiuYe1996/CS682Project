Inhomogeneous forcing and transient
climate sensitivity
Drew T. Shindell
Understanding climate sensitivity is critical to projecting
climate change in response to a given forcing scenario.
Recent analyses1–3have suggested that transient climate
sensitivity is at the low end of the present model rangetaking into account the reduced warming rates during the past10–15 years during which forcing has increased markedly
4.I n
contrast, comparisons of modelled feedback processes with
observations indicate that the most realistic models havehigher sensitivities
5,6. Here I analyse results from recent
climate modelling intercomparison projects to demonstrate
that transient climate sensitivity to historical aerosols and
ozone is substantially greater than the transient climatesensitivity to CO
2. This enhanced sensitivity is primarily caused
by more of the forcing being located at Northern Hemispheremiddle to high latitudes where it triggers more rapid land
responses and stronger feedbacks. I ﬁnd that accounting for
this enhancement largely reconciles the two sets of results, andI conclude that the lowest end of the range of transient climateresponse to CO
2in present models and assessments7(<1.3◦C)
is very unlikely.
Modelled transient climate responses were in good agreement
withtheunderstandingofhistoricalforcingandobservedwarmingtrends in most analyses to ~2006 (ref. 8). Recent measurementsposed a problem, however: warming rates were slower during the
past10–15yearswhilepositiveforcingcontinuedtoincreaserapidly

4,9. Although there are uncertainties in the recent
forcingtrendsandatleastpartofthereducedwarmingratecouldbe
duetointernalvariability,analysesinboththescientificliterature1,2
and the popular press3accounting for those factors concluded
that climate sensitivity is likely towards the low end of presentmodels’range.
Inferring climate sensitivity from recent observations requires
a thorough understanding of both recent forcing and the global
mean response to various forcing agents. Although the forcing hasbeenstudiedindetail,theglobalmeanresponsehasconventionallybeen assumed to be the same for all forcing agents (in all such
analyses, not only the most recent). I examine the response to
historicalanthropogenicinhomogeneousforcinginthemostrecentsetofstateoftheartclimatemodelsimulations:theCoupledModelIntercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5; ref. 10). Simulationsto examine the influence of aerosols and ozone on climate were
part of CMIP5 (ref. 10), but were relegated to a low priority
and few results are available. Hence to examine the response toaerosols and ozone, I analyse CMIP5 historical simulations of theresponse to all forcings (histAll), to well-mixed greenhouse gas
(WMGHG) forcing (histGHG) and to natural forcing (histNat),
using the residual of histAll −(histGHG +histNat )following two
methods.Method1assumesthatstratosphericwatervapourforcinginducesaresponsesimilartoWMGHGs,sothattheresidual(with
scaled histGHG) represents the response to aerosol +ozone +
land-use (LU; representing anthropogenic changes in vegetationcover and land usage). Method 2 assumes that the response topositive stratospheric water vapour forcing oﬀsets the response to
negativeLUforcing,leavingaresidualrepresentingonlyaerosols +
ozone(Methods).
Iincludetheeightmodelsforwhichforcingduetoaerosolsand
ozone has been documented
11and all of these transient historical
climate simulations are available. I evaluate the transient climateresponse (TCR), defined as the global mean temperature change
in response to gradually increasing (1% yr
−1)CO 2at the time
of its doubling in a given model12(all values annual averages).
For consistency, the response to other forcings, which I refer tomore generally as transient climate sensitivity, is given using thesame scale (that is, the response per unit forcing times a model’s
doubled CO
2forcing). Uncertainty in the TCR for a particular
model stems from both the responses and the forcings, with thepoorly documented LU forcing contributing the largest fraction inthesecalculations.
All of the available CMIP5 models show greater TCR for
historicalinhomogeneousforcingthanforWMGHGforcing(Fig.1andSupplementaryTable1).TheTCRforWMGHGis 2.0±0.3

(mean and s.d. across model ensembles), whereas it is 2.9±1.0◦C
foraerosol +ozone +LU(Method1)and 3.0±1.1◦Cforaerosol +

fortreatingtheseminorforcingagents(LUandstratosphericwatervapour), and seem to be dominated by the response to aerosoland ozone forcing. The TCR for aerosol +ozone is 45±38%

Analysis of the large-scale forcing and temperature response
patterns provides both further confidence that the enhanced TCRis due to aerosol +ozone forcing and insight into the large
spread in model results. The models have greater net negative

However,thereis ∼0.2◦Clesspresentwarmingaccountingforthe

These results have several additional implications. Forcing in
CMIP5 models has been estimated assuming that all forcing
agents have a similar forcing/response relationship as the onefor WMGHG (ref. 13). Such an analysis would systematicallyoverestimate net aerosol +ozone forcing (the dependence of this
method on constant regional warming and feedback patterns has
been noted
25). Similarly, global mean temperature responses to
projected aerosol and ozone forcing would be underestimated ifthe forcing distribution is not accounted for. Such biases aﬀectsimple box model calculations
26, and lead to underestimates of
aerosol impacts in calculations using simple models27relative to
analogous calculations using full three-dimensional composition–climatemodels
28(seealsoSupplementaryInformation).
As there is a high correlation between TCR and equilibrium
climate sensitivity, the results suggest the lowest end of model

with palaeoclimate evidence29). Further work is clearly needed to

Methods
I examine all models for which both historical climate simulations and forcing
diagnostics are available (see also Sup plementary Information). I exclude
NCAR-CAM3.5 and bcc-csm1-1 as they omit aerosol indirect eﬀects. I alsoexclude GISS-E2-R as this model overestimates negative SH nitrate aerosol and
ozone forcing
11,30, so that its NH and SH forcings are quite similar, making its
historical runs unsuited to studying the impact of hemispherically asymmetric

forcing (other models have substantially greater hemispheric forcing gradients).
Although they may be biased, historical aerosol-only simulations with that modelare included because there are only four available models and these results are
used only in a single comparison complementing the primary analysis. This
results in eight available models in the primary analysis (Supplementary Table 1).
The residual of histAll −(histGHG +histNat )includes not only the response
to aerosols and ozone, but also to LU and stratospheric water, as well as any
nonlinearities. The forcings are ch aracterized as follows. Doubled CO
2forcing
estimated using the fixed-sea surface temperature (SST) method in individual
models is used when available12, with estimates derived by linear regression used
in the few cases when fixed-SST simulations were not performed13. HistGHG
forcing has been diagnosed from the CMIP5 simulations using linear regression13.
I use these for all models except for CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, MRI-CGCM3 andHadGEM2, for which the regression-based analysis yielded values quite diﬀerent
from values using fixed-SSTs (which is used for aerosol forcing) in an earlier
analysis
12. For those models, fixed-SST results are used if available, and otherwise
regression-method estimates are adjus ted on the basis of the diﬀerences between
the two methods (Supplementary Information). Ozone forcing is from ACCMIPanalyses
11, with the value for a few models that use prescribed ozone changes set
to0.27±0.14Wm−2, based on forcing calculations for those data sets
(Supplementary Information), and using the multi-model mean spatial pattern.For LU, I take the central estimate of forcing as −0.085Wm
−2with a range of
the same magnitude so that −0.17Wm−2is the high-end forcing and the
low-end forcing is zero (see Supplementary Information). The exception to this is
the NorESM1-M model, which does not have LU forcing and hence a value of
zero is used. For stratospheric water, I use a value of 0.07±0.05Wm−2following
the most recent assessment4. I then analyse the response to inhomogeneous
forcing, histAll −(histGHG +histNat ), in two ways: (Method 1) assuming the
response to stratospheric water vapour is the same as that for WMGHG becauseit is similarly distributed globally (that is, the histGHG response is multiplied by
(F
WMGHG +0.07 )/FWMGHG,w h e r e Fis forcing), and hence the residual represents
aerosol +ozone +LU, and (Method 2) assuming the LU and stratospheric water
forcings oﬀset one another, and hence the unmodified residual represents aerosol
+ozone (see also Supplementary Information).
For this analysis, I compare simulated temperatures for 2000 (average over
1996–2005) with those during 1850–1859 (although for GFDL-CM3 I use
1860–1869 for the first period, the earliest available; and for HadGEM2 I usedDecember 1859–November 1869 and December 1995–November 2005), with
model drift removed by subtracting changes over the same time periods in
control runs. Temperature averages are taken over up to five available ensemble
members. Values are very similar to those I obtain with these decadal diﬀerences
when instead using linear regression over the full length of the simulations
13.
TCR for the models is simply given by the simulated temperature change
divided by the imposed forcing, all multiplied by the doubled CO 2forcing
(Supplementary Information). To calculate TCR from observations, using theequation given in the text, forcing from solar and contrails is taken as 0.1Wm
−2
in total4. Uncertainties in TCR are computed with a Monte Carlo approach
incorporating uncertainties in historical temperature change, forcing and
response enhancement for inhomogeneous forcing (the value of E), all of which
are assumed to be independent. Given tha t the TCR incorporating the enhanced
response to inhomogeneous aerosol forcing is quite sensitive to the magnitude of
that forcing, the results are in turn quite sensitive to the assumed reduction of the
modelled aerosol forcing values. For example, if I do not include the 0.3Wm−2
bias-adjustment to the aerosol forcing, the mean TCR increases by 0.7◦C. As I
used the smaller aerosol forcing value including this adjustment in the TCR
calculation from observed surface temperature changes, I reduced the range ofthe positive uncertainty on the aerosol forcing, but further work is needed to
better constrain aerosol forcing.
