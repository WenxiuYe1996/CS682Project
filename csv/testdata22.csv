Chemically active climate compounds are either primary compounds like methane (CH 4), removed by
oxidation in the atmosphere, or secondary compounds like ozone (O 3), sulfate and organic aerosols, both
formed and removed in the atmosphere. Man-induced climate–chemistry interaction is a two-way
process: Emissions of pollutants change the atmospheric composition contributing to climate change
through the aforementioned climate components, and climate change, through changes in temperature,dynamics, the hydrological cycle, atmospheric stability, and biosphere-atmosphere interactions, affects
the atmospheric composition and oxidation processes in the troposphere. Here we present progress in
our understanding of processes of importance for climate–chemistry interactions, and their contribu-tions to changes in atmospheric composition and climate forcing. A key factor is the oxidation potential
involving compounds like O
3and the hydroxyl radical (OH). Reported studies represent both current and

studies of chemically active climate compounds like O 3, and of particles inducing both direct and indirect
effects. Through EU projects like ACCENT, QUANTIFY, and the AeroCom project, extensive studies on
regional and sector-wise differences in the impact on atmospheric distribution are performed. Studies
have shown that land-based emissions have a different effect on climate than ship and aircraft emissions,and different measures are needed to reduce the climate impact. Several areas where climate change can
affect the tropospheric oxidation process and the chemical composition are identiﬁed. This can take
place through enhanced stratospheric–tropospheric exchange of ozone, more frequent periods withstable conditions favoring pollution build up over industrial areas, enhanced temperature induced
biogenic emissions, methane releases from permafrost thawing, and enhanced concentration through
reduced biospheric uptake. During the last 5–10 years, new observational data have been made available
and used for model validation and the study of atmospheric processes. Although there are signiﬁcantuncertainties in the modeling of composition changes, access to new observational data has improved
modeling capability. Emission scenarios for the coming decades have a large uncertainty range, in
particular with respect to regional trends, leading to a signiﬁcant uncertainty range in estimated regionalcomposition changes and climate impact.

1. Introduction
The coupling between climate change and atmospheric
composition results from the basic structure of the Earth-atmo-
sphere climate system, and the fundamental processes within it.
The composition of the atmosphere is determined by natural and
human-related emissions, and the energy that ﬂows into, out of,
and within the atmosphere. The principal source of this energy is
sunlight at ultraviolet (UV), visible, and near-infrared (NIR)
wavelengths. This incoming energy is balanced at the top of the
atmosphere by the outgoing emission of infrared (IR) radiation
from the Earth’s surface and from the atmosphere. The structure of
the troposphere (with temperature generally decreasing with
altitude) is largely determined by the energy absorbed at or near
the Earth’s surface, which leads to the evaporation of water and
the presence of reﬂecting clouds. Through many interactions, the
composition and chemistry of the atmosphere are inherently
connected to the climate system. The importance of climate–
chemistry interactions has been recognized for more than 20 years
(Ramanathan et al., 1987 ).
Atmospheric composition inﬂuences climate by regulating the
radiation budget. As shown in Fig. 1 , clouds reﬂect incoming solar
radiation (the albedo effect) and absorb outgoing surface thermal
radiation, and reradiate at the local temperature (the greenhouse
effect). It is well recognized that the thermal structure of the
atmosphere is inﬂuenced by the presence of small amounts of H 2O,
CO2,C H 4,O3, and aerosols. The main radiative effect of the gases isthrough the greenhouse effect, while aerosols may either heat or
cool the surface, depending on their optical properties, which affect
the solar and thermal radiation.
Compounds like methane, ozone, and different types of
secondary particles (sulfate, organic particles and nitrate) are active
chemical compounds in the troposphere; they also have important
radiative effects on climate. These compounds are either emitted
directly into the atmosphere (methane, primary particles), or

climate from O 3and secondary particles are non-uniform and will
be more difﬁcult to assess than those of the well-mixed greenhouse
gases (methane). For example, changes in absolute O 3densities in
the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere have been demon-
strated to lead to pronounced impact on surface temperature
(Wang and Sze, 1980; Lacis et al., 1990 ).
Pollutants such as CO, VOC, NO xand SO 2, which by themselves
are negligible greenhouse compounds, have an important indirect
effect on climate by altering the abundances of radiatively active
gases such as O 3and CH 4. Furthermore, they act as precursors for
sulfate and secondary organic particles. Oxidation in the tropo-
sphere, driven by solar UV photo dissociation, result in the
formation of the hydroxyl radical (OH), the key oxidant in the
troposphere. The hydroxyl radical initiates a large number of
chemical reactions affecting the climatically important compounds
such as ozone, methane, and secondary particles.
Although the potential importance of the coupling between
climate change and atmospheric chemistry has been recognized for
some time, it is only recently that it has been possible to capture the
full complexity of the most important interactions. Observations
and theory go hand in hand towards understanding this
complexity. An important example is the emerging evidence that
key interactions can occur through atmosphere-biosphere inter-
actions ( Fowler et al., 2009 ), affecting biogenic emissions, ozone
deposition, uptake and removal of particles in clouds.
New observations, in particular from satellite platforms, provide
data to verify models and to diagnose the chemical and physical
processes, which are important for understanding chemical
distributions and processes involved, as well as their long time
trends and sensitivity to climate change.
Tropospheric climate–chemistry interactions deal to a largely
with chemical processes and compounds that show large inho-
mogeneous global distribution and trends, mainly initiated by
inhomogeneous distribution of precursor emissions. There have
been extensive studies of climate impact from speciﬁc sectors with
large spatial variations in emissions and composition changes such
as air and ship trafﬁc during the past 3–5 years ( Sausen et al., 2005;
Eyring et al., 2005a,b ;Eyring et al., 2007a; Dalsøren et al., 2007 ).
The potential impact from such sectors is discussed.
There are signiﬁcant differences in the temporal changes of
human-related emissions and natural emissions as well as in their
geographical distribution. Human-related emissions are character-
ized by different responses worldwide to regulations and to different
growth rates in energy use, in transportation systems, and in
industrial behavior. European and U.S. emissions of pollutants
generally show reductions from regulatory actions over the last 2 to
3 decades, while emissions in regions like Southeast Asia, and in
other developing countries show large increases during recent years.
Similarly, certain industrial sectors such as aircraft and shipping
show large increases, with potential for further large increases in the
future (see Chapter 3). Natural emissions of key climate precursors
(NO x, CO, biogenic VOCs and sulfur compounds) are characterized
with large year-to-year variations (e.g., biomass burning).
In addition, there is a strong potential for large changes in the
emission and deposition of these compounds resulting from future
climate change (e.g., due to changes in surface temperature,
moisture, atmospheric stability and biogenic activity). Such climate
responses have the potential to affect global chemistry. Although
there are a few recent examples indicating possible strong feedback
from climate change ( Zeng and Pyle, 2003; Collins et al., 2003; Sitchet al., 2007; Solberg et al., 2008 ), further studies are needed to
reveal the full extent of this impact.
This synthesis is based on studies following the Working Group
I Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC ( IPCC, 2007 ). ACCENT
activities, and activities obtained in other EU ﬁnanced projects
have initiated some of the results described. The IPCC report
describes progress in understanding of the human and natural
drivers of climate change, climate processes and attribution,
observed climate changes and estimates of projected future
changes. We will especially focus on developments of signiﬁcance
for climate–chemistry interactions that have appeared after the
writing of the IPCC report, with reference to newly published
research results. We will, however, also include earlier work where
we ﬁnd it necessary, to give a more comprehensive picture of the
scientiﬁc development.
2. Key interactions in the climate–chemistry system
The physical climate is a major determinant of the atmospheric
concentration for all chemically active species, including key
climate compounds like CH 4,O3and secondary aerosol compounds
like sulfate and organic aerosols. This applies both locally (more
important for short-lived species, e.g., ozone, aerosols) and globally
(more important for long-lived species, e.g., methane). The physical
state of the atmosphere varies considerably with location, in
particular with altitude and latitude. Physical climate exerts its
inﬂuence in many ways, e.g., by affecting natural emissions,
photolysis rates, chemical reactions, transport and mixing, and
deposition processes. When considering climate–chemistry inter-
actions in the atmosphere, it is not only important to study the
emissions and distribution of the climate compounds, but also to
consider the chemical processes and the distribution of the
compounds determining the tropospheric oxidation.
An overview of important climate–chemistry interactions is
given in Fig. 2 for the chemical active climate compounds O 3,C H 4,
and particles (sulfate, secondary organic aerosols (SOA)) and dis-
cussed in Chapter 7.
The role of climate for atmospheric chemistry can be demon-
strated by considering its inﬂuence on the hydroxyl radical (OH).
OH is the major component for the overall oxidising capacity of the
troposphere. The primary source of OH is the reaction of excited
state oxygen atoms, and it is formed from ozone photolysis, and
reaction with water vapour:
O3Dhn/Oð1DÞDO2ðl<320 nm Þ (R1)
Oð1DÞDH2O/2OH (R2)
Water vapour concentrations are assumed to increase in
a warming climate, thus increasing the rate of reaction R2, which
contributes to ozone loss as it competes with the stabilization of O
(1D) to the ground-state oxygen atom that would return ozone. On
the other hand, higher temperatures also cause larger emissions of
isoprene, an important ozone precursor, and reduce the stability ofPAN, thus releasing NO
x, which catalyzes ozone production. Model
studies indicate that the result of these temperature responses
would be an increase in summertime ozone over polluted areas and
a reduction of background ozone ( Jacob and Winner, 2009 ). The
same publication also summarizes possible effects of temperature
increase on particle formation, with sulphate aerosols likely to
increase in a warming climate related to faster SO 2oxidation
(Aw and Kleeman, 2003; Dawson et al., 2007; Kleeman, 2007 ),
while nitrate particles and organic semi-volatile components are
reduced as they shift from the particle phase to the gas phase
(Sheehan and Bowman, 2001; Tsigaridis and Kanakidou, 2007 ).I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 51412.1. Observing chemistry–climate interactions
Direct observation of chemistry–climate interactions is extremely
challenging. Composition change is often caused by non-climate
factors such as anthropogenic emission trends, while multiple
forcing agents have caused climate change in recent decades. This
makes it difﬁcult to attribute trends to particular gaseous or aerosol
species. The hemispheric asymmetry of observed temperature
trends and characteristics of the regional spatial structure of
temperature changes have been used however to indirectly estimate
the effects of Northern Hemisphere sulfate aerosols ( Santer et al.,
1996; Kaufmann and Stern, 2002; Stott et al., 2006 ).
Some effects of climate change on chemistry are observed
during short-term climate anomalies periods. For example, as
expected from the atmospheric increase in sulfate particles, global
temperatures decreased signiﬁcantly during the years following
the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Observations show that tropo-
spheric water vapor decreased after the eruption ( Soden et al.,
2002 ), in agreement with the response seen in climate models.
Additionally, methane emissions from wetlands were reduced
during this time ( Walter et al., 2001 ). Observations provide addi-
tional evidence for climate-sensitive emissions: Satellite measure-
ments show inter-annual variations in formaldehyde distributions
that appear to be tied to changes in biogenic isoprene emissions
(Palmer et al., 2006 ). Ice core records show that emissions of
mineral dust can also change dramatically with climate change, at
least over glacial-interglacial transitions ( Delmonte et al., 2004 ).
Large inter-annual variations in biomass burning have also beenobserved ( van der Werf et al., 2006 ), some of which have been
related to climate (such as anomalies following a large ENSO event).
The inﬂuence of composition changes on climate has been
estimated using a variety of observations. Changes in the Earth’s
outgoing energy have been observed at precisely the wavelengths
where CO 2, methane and ozone absorb long-wave radiation,
demonstrating their impact in the enhancement of the greenhouse
effect ( Harries et al., 2001 ). Recently, satellite data have been used
to estimate the clear-sky radiative forcing from upper tropospheric
ozone over the oceans at 0.48 /C60.14 W m/C02(Worden et al., 2008 )
(note that this is a total forcing value, not the anthropogenic
portion). For aerosols, satellite-based estimates of the direct all-sky
forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) have yielded values
of/C00.35 to /C00.9 W m/C02(Chung et al., 2005; Bellouin et al., 2005;
Quaas et al., 2008 ), with uncertainty ranges that do not overlap,
emphasizing the large uncertainties resulting from the use of
satellite measurements of optical attenuation to infer aerosol
forcing. Such estimates require assumptions about factors such as
aerosol composition, shape, scattering properties, and location
relative to clouds. Satellite data have also been used to estimate
radiative forcing due to indirect effect of aerosols on cloud albedo
(the ﬁrst indirect effect), yielding a value of /C00.2/C60.1 W m/C02
(Quaas et al., 2008 ), substantially lower than that seen in most
forward model calculations.
Although there are limitations to forcing estimate from ozone
and aerosols using satellite observations, such data usually have
better global coverage than traditional data from ground based and
aircraft observations. One limitation with satellite data is that

sign is uncertain or regionally very variable. The sizes of the boxes indicate the importance of the changes for the respective component. The boxes ar e also placed vertically
approximately where the effects are most pronounced.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5142forcing is based on the total abundance of the species rather than
on the anthropogenic contribution. Additionally, satellite data are
generally limited in spatial coverage, and tend to lack sufﬁcient
coverage at high latitudes. Furthermore, radiative forcing, while
a useful metric, does not describe fully the climate response to
ozone and aerosols, especially at regional scales. Finally, the infor-
mation obtained by satellites is not sufﬁcient to characterize the
effects of aerosols.
At smaller spatial scales, much more detailed measurements are
available, giving more precise estimates of aerosol radiative effects.
For example, absorbing aerosols can substantially perturb both
total organic aerosols and surface radiative ﬂuxes ( Satheesh and
Ramanathan, 2000 ). Aerosols can also have a strong warming effect
by enhancing cloudiness at high latitudes during seasons with little
sunlight ( Garrett and Zhao, 2006; Lubin and Vogelmann, 2006 )
(see Section 6.4.2 ). Model studies have provided indirect conﬁr-
mation of the ability of aerosols to modulate local temperatures and
precipitation based on comparison of climate observations with
simulations with and without observed absorbing aerosols ( Menon
et al., 2002 ). These data provide valuable information about
chemistry–climate interactions on regional scales.
2.2. Modeling chemistry–climate interactions
A range of numerical models is developed to investigate
connections between atmospheric chemistry and the climate
system. Past changes in atmospheric composition and climate, and
projections of the future state of the atmosphere under various
scenarios use such models to understand observations. The
following discussion is restricted to models at the global scale.
Chemistry-Transport Models (CTMs) are three-dimensional
models of atmospheric composition driven by meteorological data.
The use of re-analyzed data makes it possible to simulate the real
evolution of the atmosphere; output from such models can then be
usefully compared to observational data, for example for model
validation. Extensive model validation was performed through the
ACCENT project inter-comparisons both for gas phase compounds
and for particles ( Shindell et al., 2006; Schulz et al., 2006 ). CTMs
that additionally assimilate atmospheric composition data, for
example from surface stations, sondes or satellites, are used to
simulate ‘‘Chemical Weather’’. These models can provide short-
term forecasts of the atmospheric composition, for example air
quality forecasts, and can be used in ﬂight route planning during
aircraft observation campaigns. Assimilation of atmospheric data is
extensively used for estimating emissions of compounds like CO
and CH 4(Butler et al., 2005; Bousquet et al., 2006; Bergamaschi
et al., 2007; Pison et al., 2009 ).
Alternatively, climate models provide meteorological data –
such models are called Chemistry–Climate Models (CCMs). CCMs
include different degrees of coupling between the climate and
chemistry components.
A CCM simulates the physical state of the atmosphere (dynamics
and thermodynamics), largely determined by the ﬂows of energy
through the atmosphere and across its lower boundary with theEarth’s surface. The chemistry model simulates the chemical state
of the atmosphere, integrating the emissions, transport, mixing,
physical and chemical transformation, and deposition of key
atmospheric components (trace gases and aerosols). All these
processes are linked to the physical state of the atmosphere, which
to a varying degree is parameterized in the models. Transport and
mixing are determined by wind ﬁelds and by atmospheric stability.
Chemical and photochemical reaction rates are functions of many
physical variables, such as levels of ultraviolet radiation, pressure
and temperature. Dry deposition to the Earth’s surface is controlled
by boundary layer turbulence and the surface properties, and therate of natural emissions of several important species is strongly
linked to the physical climate.
While the physical climate strongly inﬂuences the chemical
climate, as outlined above, there are also inﬂuences of the chemical
climate on the physical climate in this coupled system. Transmission
of radiation through the atmosphere depends on the distribution of
radiatively active gases and aerosols. In the stratosphere, where large
quantities of UV radiation are absorbed mainly by ozone, signiﬁcant
local heating, and reduced penetration into the troposphere occur.
Parameterizations of stratospheric interactions in a CCM remain
a major research area since the high complexity of CCMs requires
as y s t e m a t i ce v a l u a t i o no ft h er e s u l t so ft h es i m u l a t i o n sa sw e l la sa
quantiﬁcation of uncertainties in the model results. This effort is
part of the Chemistry–Climate Model Validation Activity (CCMVal)
of the SPARC (Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate
Programme) ( Eyring et al., 2005a,b; 2006; 2007b ).
Aerosol–cloud interactions represent an area with potential for
strong interactions in the climate system. Aerosols determine the
cloud radiative properties and thus the radiative heating/cooling,
and participate in the precipitation process. Fig. 3 illustrates the
processes linking aerosols, clouds and climate. Although consider-
able progress has been made in recent years to include parame-
terization of aerosol–cloud droplet interaction and explicit
microphysics for cloud water/ice content in GCMs, inadequate
understanding of the processes contributes to signiﬁcant uncer-
tainties in model simulated future climate changes. The individual
components shown in Fig. 3 are currently being developed, but
there is still a lack of consistent and accurate parameterization for
and their implementation into GCMs is being actively pursued
(IPCC, 2007 ). Further discussions of the interactions are presented
in more detail in Sections 5.2–5.4 .
Tropospheric composition also interacts with the physical
climate system via radiatively active trace gases and aerosols. In
typical ‘‘state-of-the-art’’ climate modeling (IPCC-AR4), changes in
tropospheric composition are calculated ofﬂine and then imposed

Fully coupled CCMs are not yet widely used in studies of tropo-
spheric composition.
2.3. Scale issues
Anthropogenic activity has altered the chemical composition of
the atmosphere on local, regional, and global scales. As of today, no
single model is capable of reproducing a sufﬁciently wide range of
spatial and temporal scales to address all issues related to air
pollution and climate change.
Due to computational requirements, there is a limit to the
resolution of global models, which currently is 0.5 or 1 degree. On
the other hand, in local and regional models it is difﬁcult to account
for processes that occur on the global scale, i.e. outside the modeled
domain, but which affect the regional to local scales within the
model domain. A well-known example is long-range transport of
air pollutants, with intercontinental transport of pollutants and
changes in background concentrations.
Most model results reviewed in this report are taken from global
models, as a number of global models now have sufﬁcient resolu-
tion to cover regional variability as well. However, global scale
models have obvious limitations in representing climate–chemistry
interactions occurring on local scales, such as the impact of particle
emissions or formation of clouds and precipitation.
Fig. 4 compares typical spatial and temporal scales of common
atmospheric processes with different types of models. For example,
deep convection occurs on a spatial scale of a few kilometers and
during a few minutes to hours. Global circulation, such as exchange
between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, occurs on
timescales of several months (troposphere) to years (middle and
upper atmosphere). Typical wind speeds of the respective
processes are used to relate spatial scales to temporal scales. The
ﬁgure also shows typical focus areas of today’s model systems. For
example, global climate models cover the entire globe, i.e. tens of
thousands of kilometers, and are run for up to several decades to
centuries to investigate long-term changes. Urban scale models
cover much smaller domains through which pollutants are mixed
over a much shorter time scale. In order to address all relevant
spatial and temporal scales it is necessary to use advanced
parameterizations or a modeling system consisting of a hierarchy of
models of different scales that are nested into each other. In nesting
approaches, particular attention has to be given to the way models
communicate information to each other.One-way nesting accounts only for inﬂuences from the larger to
the smaller scale, the ﬂow of information going from the coarse
model to the ﬁner-scale model, while in two-way nesting, feedback
processes from the high resolution to the coarse resolution domain
are also considered. The small-scale model uses output from the
large-scale model as boundary condition, while the large-scale
model uses a combination of output from the small-scale model to
deﬁne distributions within the domain covered by the small-scale
model. For instance at the boundaries of the smaller-scale model,
the larger scale model can provide temporally and spatially varying
ozone and particulate matter, which are species that have a sufﬁ-
ciently long lifetime to be transported over the smaller-scale model
domain. In two-way nesting, the larger scale model may replace or
assimilate species distributions from the smaller-scale model in the
grid boxes where a higher resolution is desirable. Depending on the
kind of model (e.g., chemical transport model or numerical weather
prediction model) the output to be exchanged includes chemical
species or meteorological parameters or both. One drawback is that
inconsistencies with the principal equations may emerge after the
distributions calculated by the large-scale model are updated using
output from the small-scale model. This is because after each timestep in the large-scale model the species distributions and mete-
orological parameters are calculated from the principal equations,
and any change due to input from another model will induce
inconsistencies. Currently available nesting techniques can thus
lead to problems such as artiﬁcial variability in large-scale models
that originates from the calculations of small-scale models, but
cannot be resolved in the large-scale models. Although coordina-
tion of research among model groups focusing on different scales is
well underway (e.g., Moussiopoulos and Isaksen, 2006 ), there is
still a long way to go until scale interactions are fully understood
and adequately represented.
2.4. Upper tropospheric processes
Temperatures in the tropical upper troposphere have increased
with about 0.65 K since the 1970s ( Allen and Sherwood, 2008 ),
essentially at what is expected from climate models based on
observed surface temperature trends. Other analyses suggest that
the change in the tropopause height could be a better indication of
climate change than the vertical temperature proﬁle ( Sausen and
Santer, 2003; Santer et al., 2003a; Santer et al., 2003b ). In particular,
changes affecting O
3is important since O 3contributes to chemical
changes and affects the temperature distribution in the upper
Fig. 4. Characteristic spatial scales versus characteristic timescales. Left panel: common atmospheric phenomena. Right panel: atmospheric models cove ring different spatial and
temporal scales. See text for more details.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5144equatorial troposphere/lower stratosphere ( Ramaswamy and
Bowen, 1994; Cariolle and Morcrette, 2006 ). Recent model studies
(Hoor et al., 2009 ) demonstrated that emission from different
sectors ( Hoor et al., 2009 ) has highly different effect on the height
distribution of ozone perturbation in the troposphere, which is
important as indicated in Fig. 1 . Measurements from satellites and
other platforms during recent years have improved the under-
standing of processes in the upper troposphere and lower strato-
sphere (e.g., Pan et al., 2007; Strahan et al., 2007 ).
The ability to represent dynamical processes, in particular
convection, is critical for the calculation of the transport of chem-
ical compounds from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere
of short-lived compounds like NO xand SO 2, and for the downward
transported compounds destroyed at the Earths surface like ozone.
Such processes can also bring insoluble organic trace gases to
higher altitudes to produce new particles ( Kulmala et al., 2006 ).
Currently in global models, this results in large differences in
estimates of transport and chemistry. Furthermore, there are
limitations in our ability to model stratospheric-tropospheric
exchanges (e.g., transport of ozone from the stratosphere to the
troposphere), and chemical source gases emitted at the Earthssurface and water vapor to the stratosphere.
Because of the importance of NO
xchanges to ozone, its distri-
bution and changes in the upper troposphere can be relevant to
climate. Models have generally underestimated the amount of NO x
in the upper troposphere compared with observations ( Schultz,
et al., 1999; Penner et al., 1998 ). In a more recent analysis ( Brunner
et al., 2005 ) based on global model studies in the UTLS region
comparisons were made with observations from two measurement
campaigns. A number of processes affect UTLS NO x, including in
situ production from lightning, emissions from aircraft, convection,
stratospheric intrusions, and photochemical recycling from long-
lived gases, especially peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and nitric acid
(HNO 3).Brunner et al. (2005) concluded that it is difﬁcult to
reproduce the observed distribution and variations, and that
adopted emissions were critical for the modeled results.
Observations have shown that there are speciﬁc processes
that are signiﬁcant for the upper tropospheric chemistry.
Acetone inﬂuences levels of the hydroxyl radical in the upper
troposphere ( Kotamarthi et al., 1999; Folkins and Chatﬁeld,
2000 ). Model studies have demonstrated that upper tropospheric
OH distribution and changes are sensitive to model assumptions
(Shindell et al., 2006 ;Hoor et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, new
particle formation is active in the upper troposphere ( Young
et al., 2007; Benson et al., 2008 ). Emissions from aviation, of
sulfur compounds along with small amounts of soot and
hydrocarbons, will contribute to the formation of new particles.
Once released at cruise altitudes within the upper troposphere
and lower stratosphere, these species interact with the back-
ground atmosphere and undergo complex processes, resulting in
the formation of contrails. Aged contrails may have effects on
upper tropospheric cirrus clouds – and these effects may exert
spatially inhomogeneous radiative impacts on climate.
The occurrence of wild ﬁres can be affected by climate change.
Fires generate updrafts that efﬁciently transport pollutants into the
upper troposphere, a process generally referred to as pyro-
convection. Several studies show that this can have a signiﬁcant
impact on the chemical composition in that altitude region (e.g.,
Damoah et al., 2006 ;Turquety et al., 2007 ).
3. Trends in emissions of chemical species and in chemically
active greenhouse compounds
Understanding of the past developments in emissions of
pollutants and greenhouse gases and the driving forces behind thechanges in strength of speciﬁc sources of radiatively active chem-
ical compounds is crucial for understanding and modeling of the
changing atmosphere as well as for the development of future
policies. While the role and historical trends of speciﬁc compounds
are discussed in the companion paper ( Monks et al., 2009 ), this
paper focuses on projections of future emissions.
The growth in the emissions of pollutants associated with the
growth of industry, transport and agriculture started at the end of the
19th century, and accelerated strongly after the Second World War.
While anthropogenic emissions of SO 2,N O x,C H 4 ,a n dC O 2merely
doubled in the ﬁrst 50 years of the 20th century, the next doubling
took only about half as long followed by another doubling in the last
quarter of the century ( Olivier et al., 2003, Lefohn et al., 1999; Stern,
2005; Smith et al., 2004 ). During the 20th century, emissions of black
carbon (BC) doubled and primary particulate organic carbon (OC)
increased by about 40% ( Bond et al., 2007 ). The largest sources of BC
and OC include solid fuel combustion in the residential sector and
open biomass burning. Recent year’s growth in diesel consumption
in transportation caused rapid increase in BC emissions. In the last
decades of the 20th century, a slowdown or even stabilization of
global emissions of primary air pollutants has been observed. As
discussed in more detail in the companion paper ( Monks et al.,
2009 ), this is due to the effect of air pollution legislation introduced
in the OECD countries starting in the early 1980s. The current
increase, owing to unprecedented growth rates of Asian economies,
primarily China and India, is not expected to continue.
3.1. Future emissions3.1.1. Driving forces
The most important factors determining future emission levels
are activity, level of technology development, and penetration of
abatement measures. Activity changes are strongly linked to
economic, population, and energy growth, but they are also
dependent on the geo-political situation, trade agreements, level of
subsidies, labour costs, etc. While production technology improve-
ments (with respect to emission levels) are also related to economic
growth, a far more important factor is environmental legislation.
The latter can be a key factor in determining the penetration of
abatement measures and consequently the apparent emission
factors. Comparison of historical per-capita NO
xemissions in the
United States and Europe shows a strong relationship to per-capita
income: for example, income above $5,000 in the U.S. led to a strong
increase in car ownership. Recently, several developing countries
reached such income levels and face a rapid increase in trafﬁc-
related emissions and worsening of air quality, especially in mega-
cities. Societal acceptance of measures to improve local air quality
has also grown with increasing economic wealth. Therefore, there
will be limits to growth in air pollutant emissions in the future
(Klimont and Streets, 2007 ). Transportation is one of the fastest
growing sectors, but, owing to ever stricter legislation, its emissions
have been growing at a much slower pace or even declined in some
industrialized countries. A similar development is expected also in
Asia, where many countries either already implement comparableemission limits or prepare respective policies.
Traditionally, national legislation drives the installation of
control technology, but in some regions, international (regional or
global) agreements have become the key drivers. Examples include
the Kyoto Protocol, UNECE CLRTAP (United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe Convention on Long-Range Trans-boundary
Air Pollution) Protocols, and EU Directives. At the national level, the
economic projections are frequently updated, as are some key
activity factors, e.g., population and energy use. Regional or global
projections of drivers are updated less frequently, and such work is
often driven by policy needs, e.g., the global SRES scenarios (SpecialI.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5145Report on Emissions Scenarios) ( Nakicenovic et al., 2000 ) developed
as part of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)
reports, EU energy or agricultural projections, and the work of
international agencies such as IEA (International Energy Agency),
OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development),
and FAO (United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization).
An example of the impact of already committed legislation on
NOxemission estimates for the SRES scenarios compared to the
original SRES scenario results ( Nakicenovic et al., 2000 )i s
demonstrated in Fig. 5 .
One additional aspect of environmental legislation to be taken
into account is the actual level of compliance. For projections, it is
assumed that the technical abatement measures will be imple-
mented in a timely manner to comply with the law. As far as
performance of the equipment is concerned, approaches vary
between studies: some assume that emission factors equal emis-
sion standards, while others make explicit assumptions about the
probability of failure, e.g., the percentage of ‘smokers’ among the
vehicle population. The latter assumptions most often rely on
the experience with existing equipment that might not necessarily
be representative for the new and future technologies. For a goodunderstanding of the projections, it is of utmost importance to state
these assumptions explicitly. There is also a strong interdepen-
dence among different air pollutant species, such that many species
can be mitigated at the same time by certain kinds of environ-
mental policies, i.e., ambitious CO
2reduction targets will result also
in signiﬁcant overall reduction of air pollutants. On the other hand,
some speciﬁc reduction technologies include a ‘pollution penalty’,
i.e., increase in emissions of other compounds, e.g., slight increase
in fuel consumption when particle traps are installed in vehicles
will lead to increase of several pollutants.
3.1.2. Global and regional future emission inventories
There are a number of key studies and papers that provide
important information on future emission levels, globally and in
certain world regions and countries. The IPCC SRES scenarios ( Naki-
cenovic et al., 2000 ) reﬂect a large, global, long-term effort. Although
the SRES scenarios assume improvements in production technology,
they do not include some of the expected changes in the future
penetration of abatement measures (the impacts of recent legisla-
tion); they do not include either some of the aerosols and PM species
and are available only for aggregated regions rather than countries.
There are a number of global projections that have been pub-
lished in the peer-reviewed literature. For example, Streets et al.(2004) developed a forecast of future BC and OC emissions, drawing
on SRES activity data and incorporating the evolution of production
and control technology, speciﬁcally for non-industrial sectors.
Cofala et al. (2007) developed global projections for air pollutants,
BC, OC, and methane up to 2030. A longer-term projection (up to
2100) for BC and OC also taking into account CO 2abatement options
and policies was prepared by Rao et al. (2005) ; the activity data are
based on the SRES scenarios. The Royal Society Report (2008)
assessed possible future changes in global and regional ozone
concentrations in 2050 and 2100, given changes in socioeconomic
factors ( Riahi et al., 2006 ), trends in emissions of precursor gases as
well as climate change projections. As part of its Clean Air Interstate
Rule (CAIR), the U.S. EPA has developed near-term emission fore-
casts of SO 2and NO x(http://www.epa.gov/cair ).
Several regional projections are also available. For Europe, the
GAINS model ( Amann et al., 2004 ;http://gains.iiasa.ac.at ) includes
projections of air pollutants and greenhouse gases up to 2030,
developed in consultation with national experts ( Amann et al.,
2008; Kupiainen and Klimont, 2007 ) and the EMEP database
(http://www.emep.int ) contains ofﬁcial projections (up to 2020) for
several European countries ( Vestreng et al., 2006 ). For Asia, several
studies looked at particular pollutants (e.g., SO 2,N O x) but recently
more integrated work has been also published, e.g., the Japanese
Regional Emission Inventory in Asia (REAS) ( Ohara et al., 2007 )
presenting emissions for several pollutants for the period 1980–
2020. The GAINS-Asia model has also been updated, superseding
previous versions and published projections based on RAINS-Asia
(Klimont et al., 2009 ).
The SRES scenarios are widely used in the evaluation of the
future distribution of atmospheric compounds. In the framework of
ACCENT and AEROCOM, two other scenarios of the evolution of the
emissions of air pollutants (SO 2,N O x, CO, BC, OC) and methane have
been developed (e.g., Dentener et al., 2005; Dentener et al., 2006b;
Cofala et al., 2007 ). The Current Legislation scenario (CLE) is based
primarily on national expectations of economic and energy growth
and present (end of 2002) emission control legislation. The
Maximum Feasible Reduction (MFR) scenario assumes a full
implementation of all available current emission reduction tech-
nologies. All these scenarios suggest a decrease of most emissions
in OECD countries, but large changes in Asia.
In spite of recently introduced environmental legislation
speciﬁcally targeting transport sector in urban areas as well as
power plant sector, the emissions have continued to grow in Asia:
the contribution of Asian emissions to the global emissions of SO 2
Fig. 5. Change in NO xfuture emissions resulting from trafﬁc emissions limits, compared with the original SRES scenarios B2 and A2.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5146and NO xincreased from about 30 and 20 percent in the beginning
of the 90’s to 50 and 35 percent in 2005, respectively ( Cofala et al.,
2007 ). Early inventories and projections suffered from poor data
availability, were too optimistic about the pace of introduction and
efﬁciency of environmental legislation, and underestimated the
economic growth, and several authors reassessed their previous
emission estimates for Asia for several pollutants, e.g., Streets et al.
(2006a), Ohara et al. (2007), Zhang et al. (2007), Klimont et al.
(2009) .Fig. 6 shows the evolution of the emissions of SO 2,N O xand
BC in Asia. It can be seen from this ﬁgure that the SRES A2 scenarios
show much higher emissions and seem to underestimate the
impact of the current legislation, especially for SO 2, while for NO x
also growth in transport demand was underestimated in the SRESA2 scenario. MFR scenarios suggest a large technical potential for
emission reduction after 2010 except BC where majority of emis-
sions originate from domestic combustion and end-of-pipe
measures are estimated to have only limited applicability within
considered time horizon.
Fig. 7 illustrates the estimated changes in emissions of SO
2and
NOxbetween 2000 and 2030 for a baseline scenario comparable to
the IIASA-CLE scenario ( Cofala et al., 2007 ), the basis for the
scenarios s used in the ACCENT model comparisons ( Stevenson
et al., 2006 ). The largest changes occur in the same areas, with
China and India showing a strong increase and Europe, North
America, and Japan a decline in emissions ( Akimoto, 2003 ).
Major uncertainties in emission inventories are associated with
inadequate knowledge of open biomass burning (forest ﬁres, agri-
culture waste burning), biofuel use (heating and cooking), artisanal
industry, residential combustion of coal, and agricultural produc-
tion systems. Due to a lack of comprehensive activity data, there is
a tendency to underestimate the emissions of these pollutants.
Uncertainties in inventories will vary by region, source, pollutantand inventory year. Uncertainty estimates for all world regions are
not available.
Uncertainties for individual pollutants differ also with the level
of experience of compiling an inventory, with reduced uncer-
tainties obtained over time. SO 2inventories have a long history in
Europe and North America and are considered relatively reliable in
those regions. Due to the short experience in compiling PM, BC, and
OC inventories and the lack of data on the distribution of tech-
nology types in key regions, these are even more uncertain. BC and
OC inventories have uncertainty ranges of /C025% to a factor of two
(higher for open burning) ( Bond et al., 2004 ). Typical reported
ranges of uncertainty estimates for Europe are: SO 2:/C65%, NO x:
/C614%, NMVOC: 10–39% and CO: /C632% ( EMEP, 2006 ). The TRACE-P
inventory ( Streets et al., 2003 ) estimated uncertainties in Asian
emissions that ranged from /C616% for SO 2and/C637% for NO xto more
than a factor of four for BC and OC. Within Asia, there was wide
variation among countries and regions, with emission uncertainties
in Japan being similar to those in Europe, and emissions in South
Asia having high uncertainty.
3.1.3. Future inventories from different sectors
The relative importance of different sectors for global anthro-
pogenic emissions in 2000 is presented in Fig. 8 (gaseous species)
and Fig. 9 (BC). The estimates are based on the GAINS model
calculations and for historical years are broadly consistent with the
EDGAR FT2000 ( van Aardenne et al., 2005 ) and Bond et al. (2004) .
The contributions shown in these ﬁgures can be markedly
different, however, for individual countries and regions and they
exclude international shipping and air trafﬁc. The ﬁgures also
show changes in the source structure in the CLE and MFR scenarios
for 2030. The change in size of the pie charts symbolizes1change
(increase or decrease) in emissions compared to the year 2000.

emissions of SO 2,N O x, and CO 2in nearly all scenarios, except for
2000 for NO xwhere the penetration of reduction measures in
transport sector was still relatively low in several world regions
leading to high emissions from this sector. It changes in the future
when relative contribution of emissions from transport declines
from over 50 percent in 2000 to about 40 percent in 2030. For CO 2
and SO 2, the industrial combustion share increases by few
percentage points from about 63 and 74 to 69 and 79 percent,
respectively.
Emissions of methane ( Fig. 8 ) are dominated by agriculture,
waste, and production and transmission of natural gas (the latter
two included in ‘‘Industrial processes’’). Growing demand for gas
leads also to increase in share of the latter sector in future emis-
sions; only in the MFR scenario effective control of losses reduces
its importance and makes agriculture even a more prominent
source.
Primary source of emissions of BC is combustion of solid fuels,
mostly biomass, in the domestic sector ( Fig. 9 ) representing over 60
percent of BC. Transport plays also an important role, especially for
BC due to diesel emissions, representing nearly 20% of total. Rela-
tively high share of industrial combustion in total emissions is
associated with assumptions of high emission factors for smallindustrial boilers (stokers) and furnaces used in the developing
countries.
4. Distribution and changes of chemical active greenhouse
gases and their precursors
Models and observations represent powerful tools to under-
stand past and current behavior of atmospheric constituents.
Observations by satellites, which have a global scale is of particular
importance for understanding large-scale distributions and trends.
Also, since we are considering chemical active greenhouse
compounds with signiﬁcant spatial and temporal variations, more
limited scale observations represented by surface and sonde
observations are necessary for understanding chemical processes
and their impact on the distribution. Prediction of future changes
due to emission changes and climate initiated atmospheric changes
(temperatures, dynamics, humidity, biospheric response), can only
be made if we have reasonable understanding of past and present
conditions. We need to know the non-linear responses in compo-
sition from emission changes caused by human activities, and the
behavior of the chemical active greenhouse gases (CH
4,O3, parti-
cles). Such knowledge helps us distinguish natural variability from
human-induced changes.
The number of observations available for global comparisons
have increased manifold during the last decade and includesatellite, airborne and surface observations ( Richter et al., 2004;
Levelt et al., 2006; Schoeberl et al., 2007; Oltmans et al., 2006 ). A
large number of model/measurement comparisons have been
performed, which clearly show that model performance and our
understanding of processes have improved ( Isaksen et al., 2005;
Textor et al., 2006; Kinne et al., 2006; Schulz et al., 2006; Hoor et al.,
2009 ). Models are also important for improving our understanding
of compounds with low spatial and temporal coverage in the
observations.
Future changes in the chemically active greenhouse gases and
particles are to a large extent dependent on the emission scenarios
adopted, which are based on assumptions of population growth,
technology development, implementation of environmental
measures to reduce emissions and economical growth. It is inter-
esting to note that growth in emissions since the turn of the century
from several sectors (e.g., air trafﬁc, ship transport) have exceeded
predictions made only a few years ago signiﬁcantly. Scenarios
commonly used in model predictions are the IPCC SRES scenarios,
the EDGAR and RETRO databases, and scenarios from the QUANTIFY
project for the transport sector, and particular databases or
scenarios for speciﬁc sectors like ship transport and regions like
South-East Asia. Unfortunately, there are not yet any common
accepted databases or scenarios for future adaption. A discussion of
future emission scenarios is given in Chapter 3.
4.1. Observations and analysis of greenhouse gases
and their precursors
4.1.1. Satellite observations
Satellite observations during the last decade of chemically active
compounds like ozone, methane, CO and NO 2have proven to be
particularly valuable for the validation of global chemical transport
models (CTMs), and for increasing our knowledge of key chemical
and physical processes in the troposphere. This improves our
capability to reproduce and assess the impact of man induced
emission changes ( Richter et al., 2004; Levelt et al., 2006; Schoeberl
et al., 2007 ). Such studies include the identiﬁcation of key source
regions, the quantiﬁcation of sources strengths, and the assessment
of changes and trends over past decades. The ﬁrst extended satellite
data set of observed tropospheric composition came from the
TOMS instrument ( Krueger, 1989 ), which was designed to observe
total ozone column but can be used to retrieve tropospheric ozone
columns.
The Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment GOME ( Burrows et al.,
1999 ) was the ﬁrst satellite instrument having enough spectral
resolution to observe ozone as well as some of its precursors (NO 2,
HCHO). These measurements were continued and extended with
the SCIAMACHY instrument ( Bovensmann et al., 1999 ) which has

capability, allowing CO, CH 4, and CO 2observations. More recently,
the OMI instrument ( Levelt et al., 2006 ) on the AURA platform and
the GOME-2 ( Callies et al., 2000 ) on MetOp add to the UV/visible
data record, with a high spatial resolution and improved coverage.
Using measurements in the IR spectral region, the MOPITT instru-
ment ( Drummond and Mand, 1996 ) has been observing CO in the
upper and middle troposphere since its launch in December 1999. A
number of other tropospheric species including O 3and several
hydrocarbons can also be observed in the upper troposphere by the
ACE instrument in solar occultation and in nadir from the TES and
IASI instruments. While the IR nadir observations provide some
degree of vertical information, they usually have low sensitivity to
the lowermost troposphere. However, they greatly extend the list of
observable species ( Clerbaux et al., 2009 and reference therein),
and allowing for night-time measurements. All of these datasets
are extremely useful in evaluating the modeling capabilities of
CTMs. In the next sections, some examples are given for CO,
methane and HCHO. Further discussion, on recent advances in
space borne observations of atmospheric composition and their
applications, is given in the paper by Laj et al. (2009) .
4.1.1.1. Methane. Methane (CH 4) concentrations in the atmosphere
have increased by at least 2.5-fold during the agro-industrial era
(the past 3 centuries) from about 700 ppb, as derived from ice
cores, up to a global average concentration of about 1770 ppb in2005 based on present-day surface monitoring networks. Satellite
observations of methane (CH 4) columns have become possible with
the measurements of the SCIAMACHY instrument ( Buchwitz et al.,
2005; Frankenberg et al., 2006 ). The measurements show the
hemispheric gradient, the seasonality and hot spots over rice
paddies and tropical rain forests. Overall the agreement between
satellite measured and modeled CH 4ﬁelds is good but there is
indication of a signiﬁcant underestimation of methane emissions
from tropical rain forests ( Buchwitz et al., 2005; Frankenberg et al.,
2005; Houweling et al., 2006 ), as seen in Fig.10 . A recent re-analysis
of the satellite data using improved spectroscopic data reduced the
difference ( Frankenberg et al. 2008 ).
4.1.1.2. Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2).Tropospheric NO 2columns have
been derived from measurements of several UV/vis satellite
instruments starting with GOME in 1995. As the lifetime of NO 2in
the lower troposphere is short, most of the NO 2is observed close to
the sources and satellite measurements have been used to derive
NOxemissions, both globally and for speciﬁc sources ( Beirle et al.,
2004; Konovalov et al., 2006; Martin et al., 2004; Muller and
Stavrakou, 2005; Richter et al., 2004 ). Although models represent
patterns of observed distributions, there are discrepancies that can
be linked to inaccuracies in missions. An example of such
discrepancies can be attributed to the de-noxiﬁcation of power
plant exhausts during summer in the Eastern US following emis-
sions regulations ( Kim et al., 2006 )(Fig. 11 ). Changes in NO x

time period August -November 2003 ( Frankenberg et al. (2005) ).I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5150emissions are particularly large in parts of China, as seen from
satellite observations ( Richter et al., 2005 ).
Comparisons of satellite NO 2measurements with model results
indicate a possible underestimation of microbial sources of NO x
(Bertram et al., 2005; Jaegle et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2007 ).
Furthermore, lightning NO xemissions derived from satellite
measurements are at the low end of other estimates ( Beirle et al.,
2006; Boersma et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2007 ) with potential
implications for ozone production.
4.1.1.3. Formaldehyde (HCOH). Satellite measurements reveal large
concentrations of HCHO over ecosystems emitting isoprene and
terpenes, in particular over tropical rain forests ( Chance et al.,
2000; Wittrock et al., 2006 ). The seasonal and inter-annual cycle
has been compared to models and good agreement was found in
many regions ( De Smedt et al., 2008; Palmer et al., 2003 ) (see also
Fig. 12 ) The observations have also been used to estimate emissions
of isoprene and other VOCs ( Abbot et al., 2003; Fu et al., 2007;
Stavrakou et al., 2008 ). Satellite observations show enhanced
formaldehyde distribution over regions affected by biomass
burning. Parallel inversion of HCHO and glyoxal (CHOCHO) has
conﬁrmed previous HCHO emission estimates but indicated a large
missing biogenic source for glyoxal, which must be secondary to
explain the satellite observations ( Stavrakou et al., 2009a,b ).
4.1.1.4. Carbon monoxide (CO). Comparisons of satellite CO obser-
vations from the MOPITT satellite instrument with models reveal
substantial differences ( Fig. 13 ). There is a large underestimate in
models of the Northern Hemisphere springtime maximum in CO.
A similar bias is seen in comparison with surface observations at
Northern middle and high latitudes ( Shindell et al., 2006 ), sug-
gesting that the discrepancy cannot be attributed purely to biases in
the satellite retrievals. Although all models show this bias, there is
nonetheless a large range of CO values in the various models.
Simulated CO is correlated with OH in the models ( Fig. 4.6 ). Some
models produce OH ﬁelds inconsistent with observational
constraints on OH, but even those models whose OH values are in
accord with observation-based estimates are biased in CO, sug-gesting an underestimate in current emission inventories of CO or
its hydrocarbon precursors. Indeed, in a recent study Pison et al.
(2009) , developed a data assimilation system and applied it to infer
CO emissions (for 2004), and came up with signiﬁcant higher global
emissions than currently used, indicating that underestimated CO
is a result of too low emissions. However, the large spread in
methane lifetimes in the models (a factor of two; Fig. 14 ) indicates
that there are also substantial uncertainties in our understanding of
the present-day oxidation capacity of the troposphere.4.1.2. Trends at surface stations
4.1.2.1. Ozone. Chemical transport models indicate that 60–85% of
the present ozone burden in the troposphere results from chemical
production in the troposphere. ( Fusco and Logan, 2003; Lelieveld
and Dentener, 2000 ). Comparisons of present ozone concentrations
with values at a few stations in the Northern Hemisphere making
continuous measurements in the late 19th century and early 20th
century suggest that surface ozone approximately doubled over the
last century ( Vingarzan, 2004 ). For the last two to three decades the
global picture obtained from observations is not uniform. In general,
the increases are larger from the 70s to mid- 80s than in recent
years with a more mixed picture. Fig. 15 shows ozone background
trends at northern hemispheric mid-latitude stations at the western
coasts of the United States and Europe as well as the high-altitude
site Jungfraujoch. At the low altitude station, the background
conditions were carefully selected ( Parrish et al., 2008 ). Ozone
concentrations have consistently increased at some background
stations in Europe and the US since the 1950s. European stations
show an increase until the year 2000 from when on the concen-
trations remained constant. At the west coast of the US the ozone
concentrations are still increasing in air coming from the marine
boundary layer. For northern hemisphere mid-latitude stations
observations are determined by trends in emission in the source
regions. The increase in the 1990s is likely to be affected by large
changes in stratospheric ozone concentrations ( Isaksen et al., 2005;
Ordo´n˜
ez et al., 2007 ).Large increases in emissions in Asia and from
ocean going ship during the last 10 years can probably explain some
of the increases at the west coasts of the US and Europe (ship
emissions) ( Dalsøren et al., 2009a; Dalsøren et al., 2009b ).
Stations in different areas of the world might show different
trends. Observations in the eastern Mediterranean over a 7 year
time period (1997 to 2004) show a signiﬁcant decline in surface
ozone of 3.1%/year, reﬂecting the inﬂuence of transport from
continental Europe with declining emissions of ozone precursors
(Gerasopoulos et al., 2005 ). Observations from Northern Canada
and the South Pole show a decline both at the surface and in the
free troposphere ( Logan, 1998; Vingarzan, 2004; Oltmans et al.,
2006 ). This might be linked to decreased ozone ﬂux from the
stratosphere ( Oltmans et al., 2006 ), or it could be a result of solar
ﬂuxes penetrating to the troposphere where enhanced ﬂuxes seem
to reduce ozone in pristine background areas ( Isaksen et al., 2005 ).
Observational record from other areas in the Southern Hemisphere
is sparse with no clear trends ( Vingarzan, 2004; Oltmans et al.,
2006 ). On the other hand, ship-borne measurements in the Atlantic
byLelieveld et al. (2004) for the period 1979 to 2002 show signif-
icant regional increases, with increasing fossil fuel and biofuel use
in Africa as the main source of this trend.

WRF-Chem updated emission case runs. From ( Kim et al., 2006 ).I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5151Ozone increases since preindustrial time are reproduced by
models ( Berntsen et al.,1997; Wang and Jacob,1998; Stevenson et al.,
1998; Mickleyet al.,1999; Hauglustaine and Brasseur, 2001; Shindell
et al., 2003; Wong et al., 2004; Lamarque et al., 2005; Gauss et al.,
2006 ), using current and pre-industrial emissions, although models
tend to overestimate ozone for the pre-industrial period.
As part of the EU RETRO project (ECHAM5-MOZ, LMDz-INCA)
model studies of the long-term trends for the last 40 years of the
20eth century were performed. In addition, time slice studies for
speciﬁc years were performed (OsloCTM2 and p-TOMCAT). All
models gave signiﬁcant tropospheric ozone burden increases
during the time period studied. The mean year-2000 tropospheric
lifetime calculated by these models are in good agreement with the
multi-model mean estimate of 22.3 /C62.0 days of Stevenson et al.
(2006) . Other model studies investigating shorter time periods,
(Karlsdo ´ttir et al., 2000; Lelieveld and Dentener, 2000;Granier et al.,2003; Jonson et al., 2006 ) were able to reproduce some of the
observed ozone trends.
Fusco and Logan (2003) made a thorough estimate of tropo-
spheric ozone distribution and trends. They concluded that surface
emissions of NO xhave had the largest effect in the lower tropo-
sphere at northern mid-latitudes since 1970. The large emission
increase and efﬁcient outﬂow from Asia makes China responsible
for 30% of the increase at mid latitudes. Methane levels could
explain 25% of the global ozone trends. Although reduced strato-
spheric ozone lead to a 30% decrease in cross-tropopause ﬂux
giving signiﬁcant decreased ozone in the upper and middle
troposphere, little impact on surface ozone was found in the
summer and fall.
4.1.2.2. Methane monitoring. Pre-anthropogenic methane levels of
about 700 ppb constrain the current ratio of global natural
Fig. 12. Seasonally averaged HCHO columns retrieved from GOME in 2000 (left panels) and calculated columns using the GFEDv1 biomass burning inventory and bio genic

implies that the present-day anthropogenic emissions exceed
300 Tg yr/C01compared to total emission of 500–600 Tg yr/C01.
Wetlands dominate the natural methane emissions and hydrology
changes driven by meteorological variability, climate change(e.g., thawing permafrost), and/or anthropogenic activities (e.g.,
drainage, deforestation) may have induced signiﬁcant changes.
However, even the sign of such changes is still unknown. While
higher arctic temperatures are assumed to increase high-latitude
emissions, tropical wetland areas are likely diminishing by rapid

understanding, e.g., in relation to northern peat lands ( Wania,
2007 ) and gas ebullition from northern lakes ( Walter et al.,
2006a,b ). Based on pre-anthropogenic methane levels and frac-
tionation present-day total natural emissions are likely to exceed
200 Tg yr/C01. New estimates on methane soil consumption amount
to 28 (9–47) Tg yr/C01(Curry, 2007 ).
Global methane monitoring networks include the in situ
networks of NOAA-GMD and ALE-GAGE-AGAGE, and the NDACC
FTIR network. The longest records currently span about 25 years.
Fig. 16 shows the NOAA GMD surface measurements from 1984
until 2007, and the yearly variability in changes in global methane.
The long-term methane growth rate has decreased markedly since
the early 1990s, with periods of nearly constant global concentra-
tion levels as is seen during the ﬁrst years of the 21st century. The
possible causes of this leveling off are subject of intense scientiﬁc
debate. On top of the declining trend anomalous events such as in
1991–1993 (ascribed to the Pinatubo eruption) and 1997–1998
(ascribed to an exceptional El Nino) have caused ﬂuctuations in the
annual growth rate in response to annual emission anomalies of the
order of 10 to 20 Tg.
Atmospheric inversion is a powerful tool to convert atmospheric
measurements into estimates of surface emissions. Estimating
surface emissions using atmospheric measurements in combina-
tion with a CTM and prior estimates of sources and sinks is an
efﬁcient approach. This top–down approach is increasingly used
also for reactive trace gases ( Hein et al., 1997; Petron et al., 2004;
Bousquet et al., 2005; 2006 ;Chen and Prinn, 2006 ). Using an
inversion model, Bousquet et al. (2006) analyzed the large atmo-
spheric variations of the growth rate of methane in terms of surface
emissions. They found that natural wetlands are largely dominating
the inter-annual variability over the 1984–2003 period. Emissions
due to biomass burning have an impact on inter-annual variability
only during the strong El Nin ˜o of 1997–1998. The study of Bousquet
et al. (2006) has shown that inverse modeling represent a useful
supplement to other estimates of methane emissions that can
reduce uncertainties associated with methane trend studies.
4.1.2.3. Carbon monoxide (CO). CO plays a key role for tropo-
spheric oxidation since the reaction with OH represents the main
loss of OH. Studies has shown that since 1980 there has been large
regional differences in the emission trends, and some regions like
Europe succeeded in implementing efﬁcient abatement measures(Monks et al., 2009; Olivier et al., 2003; EPA, 2003; EMEP, 2004;
Dalsøren et al., 2007 ). Northern Hemisphere (NH) CO observations
indicate an increase of about 1% year/C01from the 1950s until
the late 1980s, which are consistent with increased emissions
(Novelli et al., 2003 ). Methane oxidation represents an important
source of CO, particularly in unpolluted regions, and is likely to
have contributed to the observed increase. There were no evident
trends for the only available station in the Southern Hemisphere
(SH). The recent regional reduction in emissions seems to be
a likely explanation for measured CO decreases in the U.S. and
Europe ( EPA, 2003; EMEP, 2004 ). Anomalous declines in global
concentrations were found for the period 1991–1993 and are
likely explained by an OH increase after the eruption from Mt
Piantubo in 1991 ( Novelli et al., 1998 ). Large enhancements were
observed due to unusually large emissions from vegetation ﬁres
during the 1997–1998 ENSO period.
4.1.2.4. OH distribution and trend. Long-term trends in global OH
will have a signiﬁcant impact on methane lifetime and thereby on
the global methane trend. Changes in global OH will to a large
extent be determined by the ratio of global NO xto CO emissions
(Dalsøren and Isaksen, 2006 ), with enhanced NO emissions leading
to enhanced OH, while enhanced emissions of CO as the main
controller of OH, leading to reduced global OH.
Common to all model based studies is an overall high uncer-
tainty in estimating OH trends. There are numerous studies of
recent global OH changes. Lelieveld et al. (2002) conclude a 60%
increase of the overall oxidation capacity during the last century. In
contrast to this, Lamarque et al. (2005) found an overall decrease of
the OH burden by 8% from 1890 to 1990. Dalsøren and Isaksen
(2006) investigated the changes of OH (as well as the changes in the
lifetime of methane) from 1990 to 2001 emission changes with
a chemistry-transport model (Oslo CTM2) and found an average OH
increase of 0.08%year/C01over this time period.
Measurement campaigns with newly developed techniques to
directly measure OH provide important insight into the chemical
mechanisms more or less representative for a speciﬁc region or
chemical regime (e.g., Kleffmann et al., 2005; Berresheim et al.,
2003; Smith et al., 2006; Emmerson et al., 2007; Bloss et al., 2007;
Lelieveld et al., 2008 ). The most widely used ‘tracer of opportu-
nity’ to determine global OH is the purely man made methyl
chloroform (MCF, 1,1,1-trichloroethane). It is not quite clear how
long MCF can still be measured, since it is currently fading out

different oxidation processes in the atmosphere could affect the
OH distribution signiﬁcantly. For instance: It has been shown by
Cariolle et al. (2008) that simulated OH is signiﬁcantly affected,
when the results from a recent laboratory study by Butkovskaya
et al. (2007) are included, which show that a small fraction of the
NOþHO2yields HNO 3.
4.2. Modeling future changes
The relatively short atmospheric lifetime of chemically active
compounds like O 3and secondary aerosols, and pronounced spatial
variability of their impact, make it necessary to consider carefully
differences in regional development in future emission scenarios.
The Atmospheric Composition Change European Network of
Excellence (ACCENT) PhotoComp inter-comparison ( Dentener et al.,
2006b; Dentener et al., 2006c; Stevenson et al., 2006; Shindell et al.,
2006 ) is the most comprehensive study, which evaluates the role of
emissions and climate change until 2030. These papers describe
results from up to 26 different global models that participated in
the ACCENT study.
4.2.1. Tropospheric ozone
In the ACCENT study of ozone changes in 2030 three emissions
scenarios was selected to illustrate possible impact of emission
changes (climate change not included): An upper estimate was theoriginal IPCC SRES A2 scenario ( Nakicenovic et al., 2000 ), a central case
the IPCC B2 þIIASA-CLE (current legislation) scenario (hereinafter
B2þCLE), whilst a lower case was the IPCC B2 þIIASA MFR
(maximum feasible reduction) scenario ( Dentener et al., 2005; Cofala
et al., 2007 ; hereinafter B2 þMFR). The scenarios represent the range
of possible anthropogenic emissions in the near future. In an addi-
tional ACCENT PhotoComp experiment the potential impactof climate
change on O 3by 2030 was studied, using a subset of 10 models.
A summary of the results for tropospheric ozone from the ACCENT
PhotoComp study is given in Stevenson et al. (2006) .I ti ss h o w nt h a t
the evolution of anthropogenic emissions has a strong impact on
tropospheric ozone in 2030. Under the high growth, unregulated A2
scenario, tropospheric ozone increases signiﬁcantly at northern mid
latitudes with peak changes over SE Asia, where annual tropospheric
column (ATC) increases approach 10 DU (1 DU ¼2.67/C21016mole-
cules cm/C02)(>20% increases over year 2000). On the other hand,
under the highly regulated B2 þMFR (Maximum Feasible Reduction)
scenario, ATC is reduced by 3–4 DU over much of the continental
Northern Hemisphere. The central scenario, with B2 socioeconomics
and full implementation of year 2000 legislation (B2 þCLE), shows
increases with ATC peaking at 5 DU over S. Asia.
Emission changes could have signiﬁcant impact on surface ozone,
with large regional variations. Seasonal mean changes in surface O 3
between 2000 and 2030 for June, July, August (JJA) from the ACCENTstudy are shown in Fig. 17 . June, July, August is generally the
maximum surface O
3season at polluted northern mid-latitudes,
Fig. 16. Global methane time series from the NOAA ESRL network.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5155whereas at other locations ozone reaches a maximum in different
seasons. In particular, decreases in surface ozone up to 25 ppb can be
achieved under the B2 þMFR emission scenario while ozone is
predicted to increase by up to 25 ppb in some regions in the A2
emission scenario. The effects of climate change in 2030, while
uncertain, are small, compared to potential effects of emission
changes. The ACCENT modeling studies show that O 3in 2030
depends in particular NO xemissions, but also CH 4, CO and NMVOC.
Therefore, 2030 O 3levels are largely determined by emission control.
In a recent study organized by the Royal Society ( Royal Society,
2008 ) several new model simulations were performed to evaluate
the relative roles of changes in emissions and changes in climate
slightly further into the future (2050) when the effects of climate
change on O 3should be larger and more easily detected. Fig. 18
shows the change in seasonal mean surface O 3projected under the
new 2050 B2 þCLE emissions scenario, relative to the year 2000.
Most regions show reduced or near constant O 3concentrations by
2050 due to lower future emissions, with improved air quality over
much of the developed world. Over the North-East US in the
summer, O 3is reduced by up to 15 ppb. There are also substantial
reductions over Europe and Japan. Ozone is generally reduced
across most of the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes by about
5 ppb. One exception is during northern winter, when reduced NO x
emissions result in higher O 3levels over Europe and North America.
This is due to the reduced titration of O 3by NO. In some parts of
Asia and Africa where there is very little current legislation in place
and where signiﬁcant economic growth is projected, increases in O 3
of up to 3 ppb are expected.
Fig. 19 summarizes global annual mean surface O 3values for the
various scenarios and time horizons considered in the Royal Society
study ( Royal Society, 2008 ), the ACCENT PhotoComp study ( Den-
tener et al., 2006 b;Stevenson et al., 2006 ), and from the IPCC Third
Assessment Report ( Prather et al., 2003 ). The B þCLE and, in
particular, the B2 þMFR scenarios represent relatively successful
futures in terms of emissions control policies. The A2 scenario
represents a policy fail situation which demonstrates that back-
ground O 3levels will increase through the next century if NO x,C H 4,CO and NMVOC emissions rise ( Prather et al., 2003 ) and control
legislation is not implemented. This is illustrated by the potential
range of O 3values in 2100 given in Fig. 19 and represents the
response of surface O 3to the full range of IPCC SRES scenarios, as
estimated by Prather et al. (2003) . The high end of this range
represents scenarios with very high emissions of O 3precursors,
such as A2 and A1FI. Conversely, the low end represents the more
optimistic SRES scenarios, such as B1 and A1 T. Note that the IPCC
considered each scenario equally likely.
There have been several recent regional modeling studies which
considered future O 3levels over Europe ( Langner et al., 2005, Szopa
et al., 2006 ,Van Loon et al., 2006 ,Vautard et al., 2006 ), over
N. America ( Hogrefe et al., 2004, Tagaris et al., 2007; Wu et al.,
2008a ), and over E. Asia ( Yamaji et al., 2008 ). The regional studies
together with the global model results presented above which
provide regional information albeit on a coarse horizontal resolu-
tion (w200 km), demonstrate that future changes in surface O 3will
be spatially heterogeneous, with different drivers in different
regions and seasons.
Several studies show that enhanced hemispheric background O 3
in the coming decades will potentially offset efforts to improve
regional air quality via reductions in ozone precursor emissions
(Collins et al., 2000; Bergin et al., 2005; Dentener et al., 2005;
Derwent et al., 2006; Keating et al., 2004; Solberg et al., 2005;
Szopa et al., 2006; Yienger et al., 2000 ). Control of emissions on
a global scale is needed.
4.2.2. Projections of OH and CH 4
Over a long time horizon (a period of several decades) methane
trends might be strongly affected by changes in the OH distribution.
In a coupled climate–chemistry model simulation, Stevenson et al.
(2005) found that the expected increase in temperature will
increase humidity and result therefore in an increased OH abun-
dance in 2030. The increasing oxidation from enhanced OH will
increase aerosol formation and concentration, leading to domi-
nantly negative climate–chemistry feedbacks (less O 3, more OH,
a shorter CH 4lifetime, and more aerosols). This is also in
Fig. 17. The mean change in surface O 3(ppb) between 2000–2030 for the period June-July-August (JJA) from the ACCENT PhotoComp study ( Dentener et al., 2006a; Stevenson et al.,
2006 ). The top left panel shows the mean change in surface O 3under the B2 þCLE scenario; the top right panel under the B2 þMFR scenario; and the bottom left under the A2
scenario. The bottom right panel shows the mean change in surface O 3due to climate change. The results presented are the ensemble mean of 26 models.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5156accordance with the CCM study of Lamarque et al. (2005) ,p r e -
dicting a warmer and moister climate with a higher OH abundance
under reduced aerosol (precursor) emissions. Note that production
of secondary organic aerosols by ozone, which is not included,
could alter these results. However, since O 3is driving the produc-
tion of secondary biogenic volatile organics it is unclear what the
overall effect will be.
Future projections of CH 4depend on the evolution of its sources and
sinks. Estimates of anthropogenic CH 4sources are available for a rangeof future scenarios ( Nakicenovic et al., 2000 ). CH 4has also signiﬁcant
natural sources. Some of these (in particular, wetlands) are strongly
linked to climate change ( Gedney et al., 2004; Shindell et al., 2004 ).
A study by Stevenson et al. (2005) for the period 1990–2030
following the B2 þCLE emissions scenario, with the climate forced
by the IS92a scenario showed a CH 4growth to 2088 ppb in 2030
when climate change was not considered, but only a growth to
2012 ppb when it was included. Dentener et al. (2005) additionally
report that using the same modeling set-up, CH 4levels in 2030
were 1760 ppb for the B2 þMFR scenario (unchanged from 2000).
These values, together with the A2 value from IPCC TAR (2163 ppb),
were used as boundary conditions in the ACCENT PhotoComp 2030
scenarios ( Stevenson et al., 2006 ).Stevenson et al. (2006) showed
that the CH 4lifetime under different 2030 scenarios responded in
generally similar ways across 21 different models ( Fig. 20 ). The
results (from 10 models) all indicate that climate change will lead to
a reduction of CH 4lifetime. However, the absolute value for the CH 4
lifetime is more variable between models, which will havea signiﬁcant bearing on the future evolution of CH
4.
4.3. Aerosol distribution and interaction
4.3.1. Aerosol trends
Deep ice core drillings allow the identiﬁcation of pre-industrial
concentration levels of key aerosol components. The anthropogenicenhancement of these concentrations in the most recent snow
deposits as compared to the preindustrial levels, which are signiﬁcant
for the main aerosol components, can be regarded as the minimum
perturbation of aerosol levels in the atmosphere. The perturbation of
the average global atmosphere is likely to be larger since glaciers are
located far from major anthropogenic source regions and thus reﬂects
the diluted state of the perturbed atmosphere.
Sulfate concentration levels increased from preindustrial levels
by a factor of about 4 in 1980 at Greenland and the Canadian Arctic
(Legrand et al., 1997; Goto-Azuma and Koerner, 2001 ). Ice cores in
the Alps show larger increases due to the proximity of the European

crosses are model results simulated with a future climate, as well as a future emissions
scenario (the 2030 emissions scenario is the central one: B2 þCLE). These show a small
negative impact of climate change on global annual mean surface O
3(see Section
5.2.2 ). All other model simulations used a year 2000 climate. The bar shown for 2100 is
the estimated range of O 3responses to the full range of SRES scenarios, as reported by
Prather et al. (2003) (from Royal Society, 2008 ; their Fig. 5.5 ).I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5157sources. Nitrate levels in the Arctic from anthropogenic emissions
have increased by a factor of 2–3 between 1950 and the 1980’s
(Goto-Azuma and Koerner, 2001 ). Ice core observations show that
current BC levels exceed the 18th century levels by a factor 2
(McConnell et al., 2007 ).
Systematic surface measurements of in-situ aerosol properties
such as aerosol extinction, absorption, aerosol composition and
concentration and wet deposition have been analysis of recent
trend. Quinn et al. (2007) report recent trends in aerosol sulfate at
Alert, Alaska which show a signiﬁcant decrease from 1982 to 2004.
Peak black carbon levels at the same location decreased between
1990 and 2000, while absorption at Barrow shows almost no trend
between 1990 and 2005.
Major technology developments are expected to lead to a shift
in future emissions with a larger fraction emitted in tropical regions
with higher levels of black carbon, primary organic particles and
organic aerosol precursors and aerosol loads ( Ramanathan and
Carmichael, 2008 ).
4.3.2. Comparisons of aerosols and their precursors
Surface networks from which we can infer information about
the global tropospheric distribution of aerosols make use of
a diverse set of instruments with subsequent chemical analysis and
mass weighting procedures (see Laj et al., 2009 ). The diversity of
the instruments and the spatially unbalanced global distribution of
sites with aerosol instrumentation have made satellite retrieved
aerosol distributions a major source of information when it comes
to describing the global distribution of aerosols. Calibration and
precision of the satellite retrieved aerosol optical depth have
improved over time with an important increase of available data
over land and sea since the late 90’s with the launch of satellite
instruments such as POLDER, MODIS, MISR and CALIOP. Conﬁdence
in their products has been established through the synchronous
deployment of ground-based sun photometers (AERONET, GAW,
SKYNET, PHOTONS) and lidar systems (EARLINET, MPLNET). Note
that the optical instruments can only retrieve the bulk property of
column aerosol optical depth or extinction proﬁles which is
ambiguous with respect to underlying aerosol composition and
size. Intensive in-situ measurements of chemico-physical proper-
ties of the aerosol are being frequently used to interpret remote
sensing products. The performance of state of the art global aerosol
models and other satellites against the bulk aerosol optical depth
derived from the satellite MODIS are shown in the Taylor diagraminFig. 21 . Considerable scatter of performance can be observed,
while the median model outperforms individual models and some
other satellite retrievals. Efforts continue in AEROCOM to under-
stand the differences and hence uncertainty in simulated aerosol
optical properties. For details about the comparisons, see Kinne
et al. (2006) and Textor et al. (2006) .
4.3.3. Diversity of simulated aerosol loads
Simulation of the global aerosol distributions suggest that the
major contributors to global aerosol mass are dust and sea salt.
Anthropogenic emissions contribute to the formation of secondary
aerosol components such as sulfate, organic matter, soot and
nitrate. Fig. 22 depicts the global simulated mass distributions for
the major aerosol components, given as a median from nine models
participating in the AeroCom project ( Schulz et al., 2006 ). Note that
the creation of a median model smoothes the distribution. Due to
their short atmospheric life-time global particle distribution can be
linked to the major source regions. From the distribution patterns
of the different aerosol components, one can also infer considerable
spatial variability in the aerosol composition.
Within the aerosol model inter-comparison initiative AeroCom,
a large range of parameters have been incorporated, including those
related to the mass balance, to optical properties and to the radiative
forcing (see for further details http://nansen.ipsl.jussieu.fr/
AEROCOM ). The initial documentation showed signiﬁcant and
large diversity for almost all investigated parameters ( Textor et al.,
2006, Kinne et al., 2006 andSchulz et al., 2006 . It is hard to explain
the differences found in mass burdens and optical properties ( Textor
et al., 2007 ). As an example of these ﬁndings, Fig. 23 illustrates the
global mass fraction of aerosol found above 5 km altitude in the
AeroCom models in different experiments. The ﬁve major aerosol

species. High fractions of sulfate mass above 5 km as compared tototal column sulfate are found in all models and point to the slow
production of aerosol sulfate in clouds and via OH oxidation. Surface
emissions of relative coarse sea salt and dust aerosol particles
translate into a relatively small sea salt and dust mass fraction in the
upper troposphere. The mass fractions for the different model
experiments of the same model are shown side by side to illustrate
the impact of changing emissions on the vertical distribution.
The diversity among models and the resemblance among model
experiments from a given model as documented by Fig. 23 withrespect to the average vertical transport have led to several
important conclusions: The current global models exhibit signiﬁ-cant and important differences in the vertical mixing of aerosol
mass. The way different species are affected by vertical mixing
processes is varying from model to model. The experiment with
harmonized emissions reveals that the internal structure of any
aerosol model was by far more important for the vertical mixing
and aerosol composition than the variations in spatial and temporal
emissions imposed through AeroCom. The larger diversity in black
carbon export from continental scale regions compared to that of
carbon monoxide could be linked to the uncertainty in wet removal

from the modeled distributions of 9 aerosol transport models.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5159and thus long-range transport of aerosols ( Shindell et al., 2008a,b ).
Other processes have been emphasized recently as possible source
of diversity, such as humidity growth ( Bian et al., 2009 ), meteoro-
logical drivers ( Liu et al., 2007 ) and different aerosol compositions
(Myhre et al., 2009 ). In general the recent works support the idea
that differences in radiative forcing originate from different model
constructions.
AeroCom comparisons documented considerable differences
with respect to parameterization of several processes, including
pole-ward transport, aerosol water mass, the split between large
scale and convective scavenging, absorption of visible light,
secondary sulfate formation, and radiative forcing related param-
eters. How these are couplings are achieved will have considerably
impact on studies of aerosol-climate feedbacks (see eg Carslaw
et al., 2009 ). It is clear that a systematic comparisons with obser-
vations, and more thorough analysis of the model structures is
needed to reduce the differences in the future.
4.4. Observed brightening and dimming trends over
the last 40 years
The major anthropogenic impact on climate occurs through
a modiﬁcation of the Earth’s radiation balance by changing the
amount of greenhouse gases and aerosol in the atmosphere. The
amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface is thereby
particularly important as it provides the primary source of energy
for life on the planet and states a major component of the surface
energy balance, which governs the thermal and hydrological
conditions at the Earth’s surface.
Observational and modeling studies emerging in the past two
decades suggest that surface solar radiation (SSR) is not necessary
constant on decadal timescales as often assumed for simplicity, but
shows substantial decadal variations. Largely unnoticed over
a decade or more, this evidence recently gained a rapid growth of
attention under the popular expressions ‘‘global dimming’’ and
‘‘brightening’’, which refer to a decadal decrease and increase in
surface solar radiation, respectively.Extensive measurements began in the late 1950s during the
International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957/58. Many of these
historic radiation measurements have been collected in the Global
Energy Balance Archive (GEBA, Gilgen et al., 1998 ) at ETH Zurich and
in the World Radiation Data Centre (WRDC) of the Main Geophysical
Observatory St. Petersburg. In addition, more recently, high quality
surface radiation measurements, such as those from the Baseline
Surface Radiation Network (BSRN, Ohmura et al. 1998 ) and from the
Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) have become
available. These networks measure surface radiative ﬂuxes at the
highest possible accuracy with well-deﬁned and calibrated state-of-
the-art instrumentation at selected worldwide selected sites.
4.4.1. Surface solar dimming from the 1960s to the 1980s
Changes in solar radiation from the beginning of worldwide
measurements in the early 1960s until 1990 have been analyzed in
numerous studies (e.g., Ohmura and Lang, 1989; Gilgen et al., 1998;
Stanhill and Cohen, 2001 and references therein; Liepert, 2002;
Wild, et al., 2004; Wild, 2009 and references therein). These studies
report a general decrease of solar radiation at widespread locations
over land surfaces between 1960 and 1990. This phenomenon is
now popularly known as ‘‘global dimming’’. Fig. 24 shows the
change in global dimming since 1950 for different locations.
Increasing air pollution and associated increase in aerosol
concentrations are considered a major cause of the measured
decline of surface solar radiation (e.g., Stanhill and Cohen, 2001 ).
Changes in cloud amount and optical properties have also been
proposed to contribute to the dimming (e.g., Liepert, 2002 ).Norris
and Wild (2007) differentiate between aerosol and cloud impact on
radiative changes over Europe. They show that changes in cloud
amount cannot explain the changes in surface insolation, pointing to
the aerosol direct and indirect effects as major cause of these vari-
ations. Alpert et al. (2005) found that the decline in surface solar
radiation in the 1960 to 1990 period is particularly large in areas with
dense population, which also suggests a signiﬁcant anthropogenic
inﬂuence through air pollution and aerosols. Several studies (e.g.,
Dutton et al. 2006 ) noted a dimming over the 1960 to 1990 period at
Fig. 23. Aerosol compound mass fraction found above 5 km altitude on global average. AeroCom A (original model state), B (present-day prescribed emissions) a nd P (preindustrial
prescribed emissions) experiments are shown if available. Model names for experiments B and P are expanded by experiment abbreviation.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5160remote sites, suggesting that the phenomenon is not of purely local
nature and air pollution may have far-reaching effects.
4.4.2. Surface solar brightening from 1980s to present
The studies on global dimming were all limited to data prior to
1990. ETH Zurich recently undertook a major effort to update the
worldwide measured surface radiation data in GEBA for the period
from 1990 to present. Wild et al. (2005) evaluated the newly
available surface observational records in GEBA and BSRN to
investigate the trends in surface solar radiation in the more recent
years. This analysis showed that the decline in solar radiation at
land surfaces seen in earlier data is no longer visible in the 1990s.
Instead, the decline leveled off or even turned into a brightening
since the mid 1980s at the majority of observation sites. This
brightening is not just found under all sky conditions, but also
under clear skies, pointing to aerosol as major cause of this trend
reversal ( Wild et al. 2005, Norris and Wild 2007 ). The trend reversal
is reconcilable with recently estimated radiation trends derived
from independent methods, such as satellite derived estimates and
the independent Earthshine method ( Pinker et al. 2005, Hatzia-
nastassiou et al. 2005, Palle ´et al., 2005 ). The transition from
decreasing to increasing solar radiation is in line with a similar shift
in atmospheric clear sky transmission determined from pyrheli-
ometer measurements at a number of sites ( Fig. 24 ).
In addition to the strong signals of major volcanic eruptions (such
as Pinatubo and El Chichon), a general tendency of decreasing
atmospheric transparency up to the early 1980s and a gradual
recovery thereafter were found ( Wild et al.,2005 ). The transition from
dimming to brightening is also in line with changes in aerosol and
aerosol precursor emissions derived from historic emission invento-
ries, which also show a distinct trend reversal during the 1980s,
particularly in the industrialized regions ( Streets et al., 2006b ).
The documented trend reversal in aerosol emission towards
a reduction and the associated increasing atmospheric transmission
since the mid 1980s may be related to air pollution regulations
and the breakdown of the economy in Eastern European countries(Wild et al., 2005; Streets et al,. 2006a ). The observed reduction of
black carbon and sulfur aerosol measured in the Canadian Arctic
during the 1990s is likely related to the decreased emissions in Europe
and the Former Soviet Union ( Sharma et al. 2004 ). Since 1990,
a reduction of aerosol optical depth over the world oceans was
inferred from satellite data by Mishchenko et al. (2007) .T h i sﬁ t sw e l l
to the general picture of a widespread transition from dimming to
brightening seen in the surface radiation observations at the same
time.
4.4.3. Impact of dimming and brightening on the climate system
A growing number of studies provide evidence that the vari-
ations in surface solar radiation have a considerable impact on the
climate system. Wild et al. (2007) investigated the impact of
dimming and brightening on global warming. They present
evidence that surface solar dimming was effective in masking and
suppressing greenhouse warming, but only up to the mid-1980s,
when dimming gradually transformed into brightening. Since
then, the uncovered greenhouse effect reveals its full dimension,
as manifested in a rapid temperature rise ( þ0.38/C14C/decade over
land since mid-1980s). Impacts of the global dimming and
brightening transition can be further be seen in glaciers and snow
cover retreats as well as an intensiﬁcation of the hydrological
cycle, which became evident as soon as the dimming disappeared
in the 1990s ( Wild, 2009 ).
Ramanathan and Carmichael (2008) estimate a reduced surface
solar radiation of 1.7 W m/C02due to BC. When including scattering
aerosols and the indirect aerosol effect, a reduced surface radiation
of 4.4 W m/C02has been estimated. Global aerosol models produce
weaker changes in the surface radiation ( Schulz et al., 2006 ) than
the observational based method used in Ramanathan and Carmi-
chael (2008) .Kvalevåg and Myhre (2007) show that other
components such as gases and contrails (direct and indirect effect)
contribute to the reduced surface solar radiation. It is further shown
that the reduction in surface solar radiation calculated by models
occurs mostly in industrialized regions, which could explain a large
part of the observed dimming.
5. Climate impact from emission changes
This section describes the climate effects related to the changes
in atmospheric constituents, including comparisons between the
components of the system and how to deﬁne the metrics for
mitigation purposes. Although various climate effects of aerosols
and greenhouse gases are discussed, focus will be on the atmo-
spheric components discussed in the previous chapters. Changes
in land surface properties are not considered here.
The use of the radiative forcing concept is the most common
way to compare the impact leading to climate change. This concept
is used because surface temperature changes from GCMs are clearly
model dependent ( Hansen et al., 1997; Shine et al., 2003 ). The
radiative forcing (RF) is deﬁned as the net change in the irradiance
(solar and terrestrial) at the tropopause after allowing the
temperature in the stratosphere to adjust to radiative equilibrium
(Forster et al., 2007 ). The surface and tropospheric temperatures
are held ﬁxed according to the deﬁnition and considered as
a response. The impact of the temperature changes on water vapor
and clouds, is for example considered as feedback.
For some of the aerosol effects the RF concept is particularly
challenging. This is illustrated in Fig. 25 showing some of the main
atmospheric aerosol effects. The direct aerosol effect and cloud
albedo effect can be calculated in a way where only the aerosol
abundance and cloud droplet sizes change, according to the radiative
forcing concept. In the case of the semi-direct aerosol effect and the
cloud lifetime effect (see Section 5.4), the calculation is much more
Fig. 24. Time series of annual mean atmospheric transmission under cloud free
conditions determined from pyrheliometer measurements at various sites in Russia(Moscow), Estonia (Tartu–Toravere and Tiirikoja, Switzerland (Payerne) and Japan(average of 14 site, from Wild et al. 2005 ).I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5161complex since not only atmospheric concentrations change, but
cloud distribution and properties, water vapor abundance, and lapse
rate as well as other factors may change. The uncertainties in the
quantiﬁcation of the semi-direct effect and the cloud lifetime effect
were the reason why only the direct aerosol and the cloud albedo
effect was quantiﬁed as radiative forcing mechanisms in IPCC AR4
(Forster et al., 2007 ). In this paper the semi-direct and the cloud
lifetime are treated as radiative forcing mechanisms and a quantiﬁ-
cation of these based on available research is attempted.
The applicability of the radiative forcing concept is that the
climate sensitivity relating surface temperature change, as
proportional to the radiative forcing is similar for various climate
forcing mechanisms. The climate efﬁcacy has been deﬁned as the
climate sensitivity of a climate forcing mechanism divided by the
climate sensitivity for CO 2(Hansen et al., 2004; Hansen et al., 2005;
Joshi et al., 2003 ). For most climate forcing mechanisms the climateefﬁcacy is close to unity (mostly in the range 0.8–1.2) ( Forster et al.,
2007 ). The largest deviations from unity of the climate efﬁcacy are
found for idealized experiments on black carbon ( Cook and High-
wood, 2004; Hansen et al., 1997; Hansen et al., 2005 ) which is
related to semi-direct effects. When considering the BC impact on
surface albedo of snow and ice, a high climate efﬁcacy is found
(Flanner et al., 2007; Hansen et al., 2004 ).
5.1. Radiative forcing from gases5.1.1. Well-mixed greenhouse gases
The total RF due to the well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGG)
in 2005 relative to 1750 is 2.63 W m
/C02(Forster et al., 2007 ).Fig. 26
shows the percentage contribution of the RF due to CO 2and other
WMGG compared to the total RF from WMGG for two past period
(preindustrial to current, 1998–2005) and the future. Estimates for
Fig. 25. Illustrations of the a) direct aerosol effect (with both anthropogenic scattering and absorbing aerosols), b) cloud albedo effect, c) semi-direct a erosol effect, d) and cloud

contribution of CO 2to the total WMGG RF in the future is evident
even in the B1 scenario with a smallest CO 2increase.
Total RF is expected to increase strongly during the 21st century.
CO2is expected to be the dominating contributor to the total
WMGG RF also in the future. The average global CO 2concentration
has increased to 384 ppm in 2007 and the RF is increasing at a rate
higher than 0.03 W m/C02yr/C01. It is worth to note that the RF due to
CO2accounts for 63% of the total RF from WMGG over the industrial
period. However, over the 1998 to 2005 time period, the increase of
0.2 W m/C02in the RF of CO 2is the same as the increase in the total
WMGG RF ( Forster et al., 2007 ).
The increased methane burden has contributed to about 20% of
the anthropogenic climate forcing by greenhouse gases since the
pre-industrial era (0.48 /C60.05 W m/C02;IPCC, 2007 ). An emission-
based assessment of the climate forcing of methane ( Shindell et al.,
2005 ) showed that methane emissions are responsible for most of
the increase in global tropospheric ozone, with minor contributions
attributed to the increase of CO, VOC and NO xemissions. From this
estimate the combined methane and tropospheric ozone forcing is
about 0.8 W m/C02, almost half of the present-day CO 2forcing of
1.66 W m/C02. Although the methane concentration increased
between 2006 and 2007 by 0.63%, this had a small impact on the RF.
Currently CFC-12 has the highest RF among the CFCs and has the
third highest RF of the WMGG (after CO 2and CH 4). The RF due to
N2O has been steadily increasing ( Forster et al., 2007 ) and, as
a result of more intensive agricultural practice, may enhance its
growth. Since the CFC-12 concentration has leveled out the last
years and is expected to decrease in the future the RF due N 2Oi s
expected to soon be the third largest among the WMGG.
The future IPCC scenarios show a spread of more than a factor of
ﬁve for anthropogenic CO 2emissions; in addition the impact of
future warming on the carbon cycle is uncertain. This indicates
large uncertainties in concentration changes ( Friedlingstein et al.,
2006; IPCC, 2007 ). A further uncertainty is caused by a recent
suggestion that increased ozone may reduce the vegetation uptake
of CO 2(Sitch et al., 2007 ). Additionally, global dimming and
changes in the direct and diffuse solar radiation at the surface may
impact the vegetation and thus the CO 2uptake ( Mercado et al.,
2009 ). Human activity has strongly altered the direct and diffuse
solar radiation at the surface ( Kvalevåg and Myhre, 2007; Mercado
et al., 2009 , see also Section 4.4).
5.1.2. Water vapor
Water vapor trends are signiﬁcant in the troposphere ( IPCC,
2007 ); they represent a feedback to the climate system). IPCC(2007) suggests an increase of 1.2%/decade for the 1988–2004
period, and an increase of the of the order of 5% over the 20th
century. As an illustration, Boucher et al. (2004) estimate a forcing
of 1.5 W m/C02per 1% increase in the current water vapor content.
Direct human inﬂuence on water vapor is linked also to human
practices such as through irrigation ( Boucher et al., 2004 )a sw e l la s
to change in vegetation ( Forster et al., 2007 ). However, these water
vapor changes are small and difﬁcult to quantify since they involve
feedback mechanisms through perturbations of the hydrological
cycle ( Forster et al., 2007 ).
The trend in the stratospheric water vapor content is highly
uncertain ( Randel et al., 2006; Scherer et al., 2008 )a n di t so r i g i ni sn o t
well established. A direct human inﬂuence on stratospheric water
vapor originates from the water vapor emitted by aircraft and by the
oxidation of increasing CH 4in the stratosphere. The radiative forcing
due to stratospheric water vapor increase from CH 4oxidation has
been estimated using two independent approaches by Hansen et al.
(2005) and Myhre et al. (2007a) . Calculated values of 0.07 and
0.08 W m/C02, are obtained respectively. The contribution of the
stratospheric water from aircraft exhaust is very small ( Sausen et al.,
2005 ), but may be non-negligible in the future ( Søvde et al., 2007 ).
5.1.3. Ozone
Within an ACCENT network study Gauss et al. (2006) applied
ten global chemistry models to evaluate RF from ozone changes
since pre-industrial time. The range of RF due to tropospheric
ozone changes obtained by the different models is almost a factor of
two. For stratospheric ozone changes, the sign of the RF varied
among the models. The differences in RF due to tropospheric ozone
changes were explained by signiﬁcant differences in the calculated
column tropospheric ozone changes ( Gauss et al., 2006 ). Differ-
ences in the RF from stratospheric ozone change result mainly from
differences in the vertical proﬁle of ozone in the tropics ( Forster and
Shine, 1997; Hansen et al., 1997 ). The crossover altitude from an
increase of ozone in the troposphere to a reduction in the strato-
sphere varies among the different models, from a level close to
the tropical tropopause to about 25 km ( Gauss et al., 2006 ).
This crossover altitude depends on the increase in the ozone
amount in the upper troposphere and the transport to the strato-
sphere. The causes to the differences in the ozone change between
the models in the upper troposphere are mainly a result of applying
different chemical schemes and parameterizations of boundary
layer processes and convection ( Gauss et al., 2006 ).
An indirect RF from ozone precursors emission, previously not
accounted for, is the impact on vegetation from ozone enhance-
ment, which has the potential to affect the carbon cycle. This
indirect effect is linked to ozone damage on plants and crops
resulting in smaller CO 2uptake and higher atmospheric CO 2
abundance ( Sitch et al., 2007 ). The indirect effect on RF from ozone
through this process could be of similar magnitude as the direct RF
from ozone changes (see Fig. 27 taken from Sitch et al., 2007 ).
5.1.4. NO 2
NO2strongly absorbs solar radiation, thereby contributing to RF.
Due to its short life-time, the distribution of NO 2is strongly
heterogeneous with highest abundances in industrialized regions.Substantial changes in its concentrations have occurred over the
past decade ( Richter et al., 2005 ). A ﬁrst estimate of RF due to NO
2
changes gives a value of 0.04 W m/C02(Kvalevåg and Myhre, 2007 )
and is less than 2% of the total RF of the WMGG.
5.2. Direct aerosol effect
In the AR4 IPCC report ( Forster et al., 2007 ) the total direct
aerosol effect was quantiﬁed with a best estimate of /C00.5 W m/C02,
Fig. 26. Percentage contribution of the RF from CO 2,C H 4, N2O, and halocarbons to the
total RF for 2 past time periods and 4 future SRES scenarios. The future scenarios arecalculated for the time period 2000 to 2100. All values are taken from Forster et al.
2007 with regard to past changes and IPCC (2001) for the future.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5163together with a rather large uncertainty range from /C00.9 to
/C00.1 W m/C02. The large uncertainty range results from signiﬁcant
differences between estimates from global aerosol models (see also
discussion in Section 4.3). Using a combination of models and
satellite observations Myhre (2009) show that the RF due to the
direct effect of aerosols is around /C00.3 W m/C02, and that the
uncertainty range can be halved compared to the estimate by IPCC
(Forster et al., 2007 ). In the global aerosol inter-comparison study,
AeroCom, nine models used identical emissions for calculations of
RF (Schulz et al., 2006 ); they obtained a mean of /C00.2 W m/C02and
an uncertainty range of 0.2 W m/C02.Schulz et al. (2006) summarized
also some earlier model studies, which gave similar results. Studies
based on observations estimate a much stronger RF for the total
direct aerosol effect, with values between /C00.8 and /C00.5 W m/C02
(Bellouin et al., 2005; Chung et al., 2005 ). This section presents
advances since the AR4 report in global aerosol models develop-
ment, and in our understanding of the differences between model
estimates and observational based studies.
5.2.1. Recent progress in estimates of the RF
Bellouin et al. (2008) have updated the simulation from Bellouin
et al. (2005) using new satellite data and performed additional
sensitivity simulations to investigate the difference between model
calculations and methods based on observations. The latest version
of the MODIS satellite retrieval, named Collection 5, is imple-
mented instead of the MODIS Collection 4 used in Bellouin et al.
(2005) . This decreased the RF from /C00.8 to /C00.65 W m/C02.I tw a s
further shown that the treatment of clouds was a key cause to the
difference between models ( Bellouin et al., 2008 ). It was also shown
that assumption of zero RF in cloudy region used in Bellouin et al.
(2005) is questionable. In Schulz et al. (2006) the RF in cloudy
region varied substantially among the global aerosol models.
Schulz et al. (2006) considered only sulfate, primary BC and OC
from fossil and biomass burning as anthropogenic aerosols.
Anthropogenic nitrate, secondary organic carbon (SOA), and dustwere not included and these three aerosol components are all
estimated to have a negative RF ( Forster et al., 2007 ). The diversity
of the RF estimates due to nitrate is large, from around /C00.2 to
/C00.02 W m
/C02(Adams et al., 2001; Bauer et al., 2007; Jacobson,
2001; Liao and Seinfeld, 2005; Myhre et al., 2009; Myhre et al.,
2006 ). The formation of nitrate particles is dependent on other
aerosol components and precursors in a complex way and is likely
the main reason for the large range in the RF due to nitrate. The
formation of nitrate in the ﬁne mode depends on the excess ofammonia and it is thus important to obtain a sufﬁciently low amount
of sulfate to allow for the formation of ammonium nitrate. Obser-
vations show an important land – sea contrast, where ﬁne mode
nitrate dominates over land and coarse mode nitrate dominates over
ocean ( Putaud et al., 2004; Quinn and Bates, 2005 ). The size of the
nitrate particles is important since coarse mode nitrate particles give
a weak RF while ﬁne mode nitrate generate a strong RF.
SOA particles were included in the Schulz et al. (2006) study, but
only a natural component was considered, while the anthropogenic
was not taken into contribution. Several global aerosol modeling
studies of SOA have been performed ( Chung and Seinfeld, 2002;
Henze and Seinfeld, 2006; Hoyle et al., 2007; Tsigaridis and Kana-
kidou, 2003 ). The results show that SOA constitute a signiﬁcant
fraction of the total organic matter and even dominate in certain
regions. Observations also show a dominance of SOA, when
compared to primary organic matter in industrialized regions
(Crosier et al., 2007; Gelencser et al., 2007 ).
As shown in Schulz et al. (2006) the spread in RF due to the
direct aerosol effect among the models is substantial even though
the emissions are similar. The diversity among the global aerosol
models is found to be more related to the parameterizations oftransport, removal chemistry, and aerosol microphysics than to the
aerosol emissions used in the models ( Textor et al., 2007 ).
Substantial differences in RF were also found using a single model,
with various meteorological input data ( Liu et al., 2007 ).
5.2.2. Atmospheric absorption by carbonaceous aerosols
Ramanathan and Carmichael (2008) estimate that the direct
aerosol effect of BC leads to a RF at the top of the atmosphere of
0.9 W m
/C02and a reduced radiation reaching the surface of
1.7 W m/C02. The estimate by Ramanathan and Carmichael (2008) is
based on a method using a combination of observations, satellite
retrievals, and models. It is important to note that the RF due to BC
is a result of fossil fuel as well as biomass burning changes. The
emission of BC from biomass burning is also associated with
emissions of organic matter and the net effect of these emissions is
a RF close to zero ( Forster et al., 2007; Schulz et al., 2006 ). The RF
due to BC is particularly strong in Asia ( Ramanathan and Carmi-
chael, 2008 ) and contributes to an enhanced solar heating rate in
the atmosphere ( Ramanathan et al., 2007 ).
The state of mixing of BC particles is important ( Fuller et al.,
1999; Haywood and Shine, 1995 ). The aerosol optical properties of
BC have been quantiﬁed and better constrained by observations
showing that aged BC is often coated with other aerosol compo-
nents; while more fresh BC particles often are not mixed with other
aerosol components (externally mixed) ( Bond and Bergstrom,
2006; Bond et al., 2006 ). Suggestions that OC can absorb at short
wavelengths in the solar spectrum ( Jacobson, 1999; Dinar et al.,
2008; Barnard et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2007 ), has not been quantiﬁed
in terms of solar absorption or RF.
5.3. Semi-direct effects of aerosols
The degree of absorption versus scattering by aerosols depends
on type and mixing state. Aerosol species that are efﬁcient
absorbers of solar radiation in the atmosphere are mainly BC, but
also, to some extent, mineral dust and some organic compounds.
An absorbing aerosol (e.g., soot) layer, as typically encountered in
the boundary layer, may therefore lead to a substantial radiative
heating in this layer and a corresponding reduction in the solar
radiation reaching the surface ( Kaufman et al., 2002; Ramanathan
et al., 2001 ). The term semi-direct aerosol effect was ﬁrst introduced
byHansen et al. (1997) . They investigated the effects of radiative
forcing in a global climate model (GCM) and found that the large-
scale cloud cover was sensitive to the amount of absorbing aerosols
Fig. 27. Indirect radiative forcing due to ozone on plants affecting the CO 2uptake for
‘high’ (red) and ‘low’ (blue) plant sensitivity to ozone (from Sitch et al. (2007) ). Direct
radiative forcing due to ozone is included as bars.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5164in the lowest model layers. A reduction in the low-level cloud cover
corresponds to a positive radiative forcing at the top of the atmo-
sphere (TOA), and thereby a warming of the Earth-atmosphere
system.
However, the concept of absorbing aerosols inﬂuencing clouds
had already been introduced by Grassl (1975) . In this study,
absorbing aerosols within cloud droplets and in cloudy air were
found to reduce cloud albedo and heat the cloud layer. Observa-
tional support for absorbing aerosols inﬂuencing cloud cover in the
Tropics was presented by Ackerman et al. (2000) , as a minimum in
trade cumulus cloud coverage was found in regions and seasons
where clouds were typically embedded in dark haze. Ackerman
et al. (2000) also presented large eddy-model (LES) simulations
showing that absorbing aerosols may reduce trade cumulus cloud
coverage by decreasing the boundary layer convection that drives
stratocumulus formation.
This triggered a number of model studies investigating the
semi-direct aerosol effect on a global scale. Some studies ( Lohmann
and Feichter, 2001; Jacobson, 2002; Cook and Highwood, 2004 )
found that absorbing aerosols decreased low-level cloud cover, in
agreement with Hansen et al. (1997) and Ackerman et al. (2000) ,
thereby reducing reﬂection of solar radiation and having a warming
effect on the climate. Others, e.g., Menon et al. (2002) and Penner
et al. (2003) , found the opposite. In Menon et al. (2002) absorbing
aerosols increased large-scale cloud cover. Penner et al. (2003)
pointed out that the injection height of the absorbing aerosols is
crucial for their effects on clouds, possibly explaining the appar-
ently contradicting results arising from different GCM studies. The
importance of the vertical structure of the absorbing aerosols for
the semi-direct aerosol effect was also pointed out by Johnson et al.
(2004) . In LES model simulations of marine stratocumulus, they
found absorbing aerosols located in the boundary layer to increase
cloudiness, while the opposite was true for aerosol absorption
above the clouds.
Stuber et al. (submitted for publication) performed idealized
simulations with absorbing aerosols at different levels in the
troposphere using two GCMs to investigate the robustness of the
responses. Inclusion of absorbing aerosols in the lower part of the
troposphere led to a surface warming, whereas absorbing aerosols
in the middle and higher troposphere caused a surface cooling in
both models. The GCM responses of absorbing aerosols clearly
show changes in the local cloud distribution and water content
(liquid and frozen) but also change in the instability of the tropo-
sphere. The climate sensitivity of absorbing aerosols was mostly
higher than for a doubling of CO 2. These idealized experiments
show that a realistic absorbing aerosol distribution may impact the
clouds and tropospheric and surface temperature in a complex way.
Further observational support for the semi-direct aerosol effect
was given by Koren et al. (2004) , based on satellite observations
from the MODIS instrument. Focusing on the Amazon basin they
found cloud cover to be anti-correlated with smoke optical depth,
and attributed this to absorption within the smoke layer, which
stabilized the boundary layer and reduced the moisture ﬂuxes from
the surface. In Denman et al. (2007) , the semi-direct aerosol effect
was summarized to correspond to a negligible or slightly positive
radiative forcing at the TOA.
In terms of radiative ﬂuxes at the TOA, the semi-direct aerosol
effect has been reported to be dominated by a more conventional
aerosol effect on clouds, where aerosols acting as cloud conden-
sation nuclei (CCN) increase cloud lifetime and coverage by
delaying precipitation release (i.e. the cloud lifetime effect, see
Section 6.4). However, a recent study by Koren et al. (2008) shed
new light on the roles of these competing effects. Based on
a theoretical framework and satellite observations from the MODIS
instrument, they reported that, while the cloud lifetime effectdominates the semi-direct aerosol effect in regimes with relatively
low aerosol optical depths (AODs), the opposite is true for larger
AODs. AOD was in this study taken as a proxy for both CCN and the
aerosol potential to absorb solar energy. The physical reason for this
transition was that, while polluted clouds are relatively insensitive
to further increases in CCN, there is no corresponding saturation
effect for aerosol absorption, which increases steadily with aerosol
loading. The study of Koren et al. (2008) uses satellite data over
Amazon, but a similar pattern for the relationship between AOD
and cloud cover is found in many regions in a global study using
MODIS data ( Myhre et al., 2007b ).Koren et al. (2008) challenged
the modeling community to test or incorporate this new concept in
cloud-resolving or global models.
5.4. Aerosol indirect effects
More than three decades ago, Twomey (1974) stated the ﬁrst
theory on how anthropogenic aerosols may inﬂuence climate
through their impact on clouds. According to this hypothesis, often
called the ﬁrst aerosol indirect effect, an increase in atmospheric
pollution will lead to an increase in cloud albedo, everything elsebeing equal. Since then, a number of hypotheses on how anthro-
pogenic aerosols may inﬂuence climate through clouds were pub-
lished. While some of the hypotheses have been studied
extensively using models, satellite data or laboratory experiments,
other hypotheses are new and controversial and have not yet been
sufﬁciently tested.
Current suggestions for possible aerosol indirect effects are:
1) The ﬁrst indirect effect or cloud albedo effect: in warm clouds,
anthropogenic aerosols increase the cloud albedo by acting as
cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), thereby increasing cloud
droplet number concentrations and decreasing cloud droplet
sizes in the case of constant liquid water content ( Twomey,
1977 and Section 2.1.2).
2) The second indirect effect or cloud lifetime effect: The
anthropogenic decrease in cloud droplet sizes causes a less
efﬁcient precipitation production, which could lead to
increased cloud lifetimes or increased cloud horizontal and
vertical extension ( Albrecht, 1989 ).
3) The cloud glaciation effect: Ice formation in clouds at temper-
atures above approximately /C035
/C14C occurs by the aid of so-
called ice nuclei (IN) (i.e. heterogeneous freezing). Such IN are
typically insoluble particles with crystalline structure. Candi-
dates are mineral dust, biological particles and soot ( Prup-
pacher and Klett, 1997 ). Soot particles are largely of
anthropogenic origin, so anthropogenic activity may have
introduced additional IN into the atmosphere. Such an increase
in IN would lead to an anthropogenic increase in freezing and
cloud glaciation (e.g., Lohmann, 2002 ).
4) The de-activation effect: A relatively new idea is that anthro-
pogenic sulfur coatings can potentially de-activate IN ( Girard
et al., 2004 ), or alternatively make them less efﬁcient in mixed-
phase clouds ( Storelvmo et al., 2008b; Hoose et al., 2008 ).
5) The thermodynamic effect: As large droplets freeze more
readily than small droplets ( Pruppacher and Klett, 1997 ), the
anthropogenic decrease in cloud droplet radius is expected to
counteract freezing (e.g., Rosenfeld and Woodley, 2000 ).
6) Aerosol indirect effects on cirrus: The formation of pure ice
clouds (i.e. cirrus) by homogeneous freezing of super cooled
aerosols may occur at temperatures below approximately
/C035/C14C. Although this freezing process can take place without
the aid of IN, the presence of IN may delay or entirely prevent
homogenous freezing, as heterogeneous freezing processes
may deplete water vapor to the extent that the high superI.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5165saturation required for the onset of homogeneous freezing are
not reached (e.g., DeMott et al., 1997 ).
Fig. 28 shows a schematic overview of how the above effects
inﬂuence precipitation, cloud microphysical properties and radi-
ation. Except from the deactivation effect, all of the above effects
were discussed in IPCC AR4, ( Denman et al., 2007 ) in light of
recent publications. Rather than repeating what was already
thoroughly discussed in IPCC AR4, we will here focus on aerosol
indirect effects, which have recently received particular attention
from the scientiﬁc community. The following sections review
recent publications on aerosol indirect effects, and are further
divided into sub-sections on warm and cold clouds, respectively.
In Section 5.4.2 , a discussion of the recent results and suggestions
of future studies required for increased understanding of aerosol
indirect effects, and ultimately the climate system, is given.
5.4.1. Aerosol indirect effects associated with warm clouds
As mentioned above, the aerosol indirect effect on warm clouds
is typically divided further into the cloud albedo effect and the
cloud lifetime effect. Both effects act to increase cloud albedo and
cool the Earth-atmosphere system by increasing the amount of
solar radiation reﬂected back to space. In IPCC AR4, the model
estimates of radiative forcing (i.e. the perturbation to the global
energy balance of the Earth/atmosphere system) associated with
the cloud albedo effect range from /C00.22 W m/C02to/C01.85 W m/C02,
with a best estimate of /C00.7 W m/C02(Forster et al., 2007 ). Low
estimates are associated with model simulations using empirical
relationships between aerosol mass and CDNC ﬁtted to satellite
data to estimate the cloud albedo effect (Ranging from
/C00.22 W m/C02to/C00.5 W m/C02). A recent study estimating the cloud
albedo effect from satellite data alone ( Quaas et al., 2008 ) gives an
even lower estimate of /C00.2/C60.1 W m/C02, suggesting that global
models are exaggerating the effect compared to satellite
measurements. Furthermore, based on ground-based remote
sensing at the Southern Great Planes, Kim et al. (2008) reported
that while the ﬁrst aerosol indirect effect could be observed in
adiabatic clouds, it was not readily observed in sub-adiabatic cases.
A possible explanation is that entrainment and mixing-processes
attenuate the effect. However, high uncertainties are associated not
only with model estimates, but also with satellite retrievals and
in-situ measurements.McComiskey and Feingold (2008) recently demonstrated how
measurements of aerosol-cloud interactions (termed ACI) differ
substantially among various observational platforms, leading to
radiative forcing that differ by several W m/C02for the same
anthropogenic aerosol perturbation in an idealized cloud case.
Storelvmo et al. (2009) analyzed the cloud albedo effect in the IPCC
AR4 models used for transient simulations of future climate. They
found that about 1.3 W m/C02of the 2 W m/C02spread in estimated SW
forcing for the year 2000 can be explained by the different empir-
ical relationships between aerosol mass and CDNC used to calculate
the aerosol indirect effect in the models.
The range of model estimates of the total anthropogenic aerosol
effect on warm clouds (i.e. both the direct and indirect aerosol
effects) range from /C00.2 W m/C02to/C02.3 W m/C02in IPCC AR4 (note
that this range is based on a slightly different set of model studies
than that of the cloud albedo effect) ( Denman et al., 2007 ). The
parameterization of auto conversion (i.e. warm-phase precipitation
formation) is crucial when calculating the aerosol lifetime effect in
the models. Many different parameterizations of auto conversion
are available in the literature, yielding precipitation rates that differ
by orders of magnitude for the same cloud liquid water content
(LWC) and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) (e.g.,
Sotiropoulou et al., 2007 ). Consequently, an increase in CDNC
caused by an anthropogenic aerosol perturbation can lead to
substantially different precipitation responses, depending on the
auto conversion scheme. Most, if not all, global climate model
(GCM) estimates of the cloud lifetime effect predict increased cloud
thicknesses and/or lifetimes as precipitation release is reduced in
response to anthropogenic aerosol perturbations.
Furthermore, it has been suggested that in the presence of giant
CCN (GCCN; typically large natural particles like sea salt and dust),
the effect of increased CCN concentrations on precipitation release
is signiﬁcantly reduced ( Feingold et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2006;
Cheng et al., 2007; Posselt and Lohmann, 2008 ). The GCCN initiate
coalescence and precipitation, and thereby have the ability to
trigger precipitation in otherwise non-precipitating clouds. To date,
most GCM estimates of the aerosol lifetime effect have restricted
themselves to warm stratiform clouds, despite several publications
(e.g., Rosenfeld (1999) based on satellite data and Wang (2005)
based on cloud-resolving modeling) suggesting a pronounced
aerosol effect on convective clouds. Menon and Rotstayn (2006)
provided the ﬁrst global radiative forcing estimate of aerosol effects
Fig. 28. Schematic of aerosol indirect effects on warm and mixed-phase clouds, originally published in Hoose et al. (2008) .I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5166on (warm) convective clouds, based on two GCMs (CSIRO and GISS).
Whereas the CSIRO simulations suggested an enhanced total
aerosol indirect effect when aerosol inﬂuences on convective
clouds were included, the opposite was true for GISS simulations.
Lohmann (2008) included aerosol effects on both warm and cold
stratiform and convective clouds, and found a slight reduction in
the total aerosol indirect effect due to aerosol inﬂuence on
convective clouds.
5.4.2. Aerosol indirect effects associated with cold clouds
Similar to aerosol effects on convective clouds, aerosol effects on
cold clouds have only very recently been included in global climate
models. The ﬁrst global estimate of the cloud glaciation effect was
provided by Lohmann (2002) , suggesting a reduced aerosol indirect
effect under the extreme assumptions that IN are present in
unlimited amounts compared to an atmosphere containing no IN at
all. A more elaborate study of the cloud glaciation effect was pre-
sented by Lohmann and Diehl (2006) , concluding that anthropo-
genic activity may lead to increased heterogeneous freezing and
thereby inﬂuence cloud lifetime and precipitation processes,
depending on the concentration and nature of the natural IN
present. Mineral dust and certain primary biogenic aerosol particles
(PBAPs) constitute natural IN in the atmosphere. While the impact of
including realistic dust mineralogy was tested in a GCM by Hoose
et al. (2008) , no GCM has so far included PBAPs. Although realistic
natural and anthropogenic IN concentrations are required for
simulations of aerosol effects on mixed-phase clouds, the interac-
tion of such particles with mixed-phase cloud microphysical
processes like the Bergeron-Findeisen (BF) process is as important in
this context. Such processes have typically been treated in a very
simplistic manner in GCMs. Recent in-cloud observations from the
high alpine research station Jungfraujoch ( Verheggen et al. 2007 )
shed new light on the BF process and its interaction with aerosols.
Further guidance on the BF process was given in terms of a theo-
retical framework presented in Korolev (2007) ; the implementation
of this theoretical framework in a global model was found to have
a strong impact on the simulated aerosol indirect effect ( Storelvmo
et al., 2008a ).
Girard et al. (2004) were the ﬁrst to test the hypothesis of IN de-
activation by anthropogenic sulfate in a modeling framework, using
a single column model to study arctic haze events. Assuming that
sulfur coatings deactivated the IN entirely, they found pronounced
impacts on precipitation rates and cloud radiative properties.
A partial de-activation of IN as a result of sulfate coatings was also
found in to recent modeling studies (in the ECHAM5 GCM ( Hoose
et al., 2008 ) and in the CAM-Oslo GCM ( Storelvmo et al., 2008b ).
Rather than assuming that a sulfate coating deactivates the IN
completely, both studies showed a shift of the IN from contact
freezing nuclei to immersion freezing nuclei. In contact freezing
mode, IN initiate freezing when colliding with cloud droplets. This
freezing mechanism becomes efﬁcient at relatively warm sub-zero
temperatures, but requires insoluble IN particles. Coatings typically
render IN slightly soluble, allowing them activate to form cloud
droplets. Thereafter they may initiate freezing of the droplet from
within (i.e. immersion freezing), but this freezing mechanism
becomes efﬁcient at lower temperatures. Although model studieshave so far focused on de-activation due to sulfate coatings, other
species may have the same coating effect. The fact that the efﬁ-
ciency of IN, such as mineral dust, may be reduced by physi-
ochemical transformation of other aerosol species has recently
been discussed in Baker and Peter (2008) . In summary, the
de-activation effect counteracts the cloud glaciation effect, and
which effect dominates in any given case depends on the concen-
tration of natural and anthropogenic IN, and the amount of
anthropogenic material available for IN coating.In a recent study, Penner et al. (2009) have shown that the effect
on cirrus clouds of emission of anthropogenic aerosols, for instance
from aircraft could have signiﬁcant impact and reversing the sign of
radiative forcing. Note that the results are preliminary, and further
studies need to be done before conclusion can be made.
5.4.3. Aerosol indirect effects associated with various cloud types
A recent and comprehensive report on aerosol pollution impact
on precipitation, produced by the International aerosol precipita-
tion science assessment group (IAPSAG) ( Levin and Cotton, 2007 ),
concluded that despite the progress made in recent years, pollution
effects on precipitation are not understood, neither on the scale of
a local storm nor on the global scale. Obtaining observational
evidence for pollution affecting precipitation release and cloud
lifetimes is challenging, and recent modeling results render not only
the magnitude but also the sign of this effect as highly uncertain.
However, ﬁndings in recent publications suggest that the effect of
incre ased aerosol concentrations on convective precipitation is to
a large extent determined by environmental parameters like the
unperturbed aerosol concentration or the relative humidity.
Fig. 29 gives an overview of the majority of global estimates of
the aerosol indirect effect. Evidently, the spread in estimates has
not decreased with time. On the contrary, estimates span a larger
range than ever, much due to the new aerosol indirect effects
recently taken into account.
5.5. Radiative forcing summary
In Chapter 5, new radiative forcing mechanisms are discussed
and quantiﬁed, as well as the increases in WMGG concentrations
affecting the RF estimates. Fig. 30 andTable 1 show estimates of the
RF for seven different types of climate forcing mechanisms over the
industrial era up to 2007. Only anthropogenic atmospheric
compounds are included. For anthropogenic climate forcing on
surface and natural climate forcing we refer to Forster et al. (2007) .
The WMGG dominates in terms of RF and consist of CO 2,C H 4,N2O,
and halocarbons. We group ozone, NO 2, and stratospheric water
vapor into a common class of short-lived gases (SL-G). These gaseshave quite variable lifetimes that are too short for them to be well
mixed in the atmosphere. Estimates for ﬁve groups of aerosol
effects are included in Fig. 30 . RF due to the direct aerosol effect and
the cloud albedo effect have been estimated earlier, but separate
estimates of the semi-direct aerosol effect and the cloud lifetime
effect have not been provided earlier ( Forster et al., 2007; Hansen
et al., 2005 ). We also discuss here an estimate for indirect aerosol
effects of mixed phase clouds.
6. Contributions to tropospheric changes from the transport
sector and for different regions
Several recent studies on the impact of emissions from the
transport sectors, in particular ship and aircraft have been per-
formed (Eyring et al., 2009; Hoor et al., 2009 ;Collins et al., 2009;
Dalsøren et al., 2009a ). Both sectors differ from land-based sectors.
A typical example of the differences is illustrated by emission from
ship trafﬁc. Ocean going ship types (e.g., bulk, oil transport,
container ship) have highly different ship tracks, with different
environmental impact, and highly different growth rates ( Dalsøren
et al., 2009a ). Furthermore, the climate impact from the different
transport sectors is different, which makes it necessary to treat
sectors individually.
Ships and aircraft have so far not been affected by international
policy measures to reduce emissions. Understanding and quanti-
fying the impact of ship emissions is particularly challenging sinceI.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5167the associated composition changes lead to large positive and
negative global climate forcings.
Recent regional differences in NO xemissions play a signiﬁcant
role in the atmospheric oxidation process and on the impact on
climate compounds like O 3and CH 4and oxidants like OH. For the
period 1996–2004 substantial reductions of NO 2were found over
Europe and the United States, corresponding to regional emission
decreases during this period, while emissions continued to increase
in developing countries and accelerated in some transition
economy regions, as demonstrated in Fig. 31 (Akimoto, 2003 ).
There has been a large increase in NO xemissions since pre-
industrial time, which have led to signiﬁcant increase in the
atmospheric nitrogen burden. Tsigaridis et al. (2006) estimate
a factor of global increase by a factor of 4. Galloway et al. (2004)
calculated an increase in the nitrogen oxide deposition from 12.8
Tg(N)year/C01in 1860 to 45.8 Tg(N)year/C01in the early 1990s. Using
emissions valid for 1992 and a critical load varying between
different natural ecosystems, Bouwman et al. (2002) estimated that
sulfur and nitrogen deposition exceeded critical loads over 7% of
the region covered by natural vegetation (See also Fowler et al.,
2009 ). Changes in modeled NO 2concentrations during the 1990s
qualitatively reproduce the different changes in regional emissions
(Granier et al., 2003 ). Large decreases are found over Europe and
Russia, smaller decreases are identiﬁed over western North Amer-
ica, and large increases in populated or industrialized areas in Asia
and parts of Latin America, which is in line with reported
emission trends in Fig. 31 . For further discussions on chemical
interactions of pollution emissions, in particular the regional
impact of compounds like NO x, CO, NMVOC and SO 2we refer to theaccompanying papers by Monks et al. (2009) and Fowler et al.
(2009) .
6.1. Composition change due to emission from the transport sectors
During recent years a strong focus has been on the atmospheric
impact from the transport sectors. Several ongoing EU projects
(ACCENT, QUANTIFY, ATTICA, ECATS) investigate the effects of aviation,
shipping, road trafﬁc and other land-based transport on the atmo-
sphere ( Eyring et al., 2007a ;Hoor et al., 2009 ;Eyring et al., in prepa-
ration, Dalsøren et al., 2007; Dalsøren et al., 2009a; Lee et al., 2009 ). The
focus in these projects is primarily on regional to global scales.
6.1.1. Studies of current impact
The European Integrated Project QUANTIFY has investigated the
impact of the various transport sectors on atmospheric composi-
tion and climate. A comprehensive model activity has evaluated the
impact of transport emissions on ozone, methane and the resulting
radiative forcing. Fig. 32 shows the combined effect of shipping,
aviation and road trafﬁc on column ozone. Perturbations are most
pronounced during the summer months in the Northern Hemi-
sphere, with local perturbations of 4% above the background levels,
although individual model increases can be larger.
Gas and particle emissions from ocean going ships are a signif-
icant and growing contribution to the total emissions from the
transportation sector. The EU ﬁnanced ATTICA project has pub-
lished a detailed review on the current state of research concerning
the effects of shipping emissions on atmospheric chemistry and
climate ( Eyring et al., in preparation ). Nearly 70% of ship emissions

through the formation of ground-level ozone, sulfur compounds
and particulate matter in coastal areas. Ozone and aerosol precur-
sors emitted to the atmospheres from ships are transported over
several hundreds of kilometers, contributing to air qualityproblems further inland. Fig. 33 shows satellite measurements of
NO2columns retrieved by the SCIAMACHY instrument over marine
areas ( Richter et al., 2004 ), revealing large impact of shipping in the
Indian Ocean, Eastern Mediterranean and coastlines in general, as
well as further inland.
Fig. 34 shows global ozone enhancements from the OsloCTM2
model for year 2000 due to ship emissions ( Dalsøren et al., 2007 ).
The signal clearly follows the conventional ship tracks, but also
affects continental areas. Calculations of ozone enhancements from
ship emissions by Endresen et al. (2003) give maximum ozone
perturbations of 12 ppb in the marine boundary layer during
summer over the northern Atlantic and Paciﬁc regions, while the
multi-model study described in Eyring et al. (2007a) using EDGAR
emissions obtained somewhat lower values, about 5–6 ppb, for the
North Atlantic. In an update on ship emissions and their environ-
mental impact, Dalsøren et al. (2009b) isolated the impacts of major
ship types and ports. The large and increasing contribution from
container ships was highlighted. In agreement with earlier studies, it
was found that ship emissions contribute signiﬁcantly to pollutants
like ozone, sulfate, nitrate, BC and OC aerosols. In another study,0,51,01,52,02,53,0

Fig. 30. Radiative forcing estimates of atmospheric compounds from the pre-industrial

et al. (2007) except that it has been taken into account that growth in RF due to CO 2is
0.03 W m/C02yr/C01between 2005 and 2007. Estimates for ozone and stratospheric water
vapor are similar to the value given in Forster et al. (2007) , whereas the estimate of
NO2of 0.04 W m/C02is from Kvalevåg and Myhre (2007) . The estimate of the direct
aerosol effect is from Myhre (2009) . The RF for the cloud albedo effect is calculated
based on Forster et al. (2007) , with the modiﬁcation that no model estimates have
been excluded based on the number of aerosol species treated in the various models.Additionally, estimates published after Forster et al. (2007) have also been taken into
account. While Forster et al. (2007) reported the median value of the estimates
considered, we here report the mean. However, the mean and median values differ byonly 2%. As few model studies report estimates of the cloud lifetime effect only, theestimate for cloud lifetime effect is calculated by subtracting the mean RF for the cloudalbedo effect from the mean RF for both the albedo and lifetime effect. The latter is
calculated based on studies reported in Denman et al. (2007) , in addition to recently
published estimates. This way of calculating the RF for the cloud lifetime effect relieson the assumption that the total (albedo and lifetime) effect equals the linear sum ofthe two separate effects to a good approximation (e.g., Kristja ´nsson, 2002 ). The few RF
estimates for aerosol effects on mixed phase clouds available in the literature suggesta potentially large effect, but so far model studies are inconclusive in terms of the sign
of this RF. Hence, we refrain from giving a RF estimate here, but rather give an
uncertainty range from /C00.5 W m
/C02to 0.5 W m/C02. The semi-direct effect is estimated
based on a combination of published results of realistic BC atmospheric distributions
and idealized experiments in Stuber et al. (submitted for publication) . The absorption
aerosol optical depth included in the idealized experiments in Stuber et al. (submittedfor publication) is 0.05, which is an order of magnitude larger than the total(anthropogenic and natural) absorption aerosol optical depth from global aerosolmodels ( Kinne et al., 2006 ). All the RF from the idealized semi-direct aerosol effect
experiments are within the range /C00.25 to þ0.5 W m
/C02if the values are divided by 10
(Stuber et al., submitted for publication ). The factor of 10 is adopted since the idealized
experiments are performed with an absorption aerosol optical depth this magnitude
larger than global aerosol models predicts for current condition.Table 1Summary of radiative forcing (RF) for well-mixed and short-lived greenhouse gases,and the contribution from different aerosol effects. The uncertainty range isincluded.

is of some concern (e.g., Northwest America and Scandinavia) ship
emissions contribute heavily to wet deposition of nitrate.
For road emissions Matthes et al. (2007) found maximum
surface ozone increases of 12% in northern mid-latitudes during
July. New estimates of the impact of road trafﬁc emissions on ozone,
has been calculated by Hoor et al. (2009) using an ensemble of six
global models. The result is shown in Fig. 35 along with impacts
from the other sectors. Not surprisingly, signiﬁcant enhancements
due to shipping and road trafﬁc are largely conﬁned to marine and
continental areas, respectively. However, the ship signals affect also
coastal areas, and the impact of road trafﬁc is not conﬁned to the
maximum emissions source regions in Europe and North America.
Signiﬁcant increases in ozone due to the aviation sector areconﬁned to the Northern Hemisphere, where they are zonally
mixed and, during summer, reach a maximum at high latitudes.
Scientiﬁc advances since the 1999 IPCC Special Report on Avia-
tion and the Global Atmosphere ( IPCC, 1999 ) have reduced key
uncertainties, yet the basic conclusions remain the same. The
ATTICA project has recently delivered a review of the current
impact of aviation ( Lee et al., 2009 ). Much progress has been made
in the past ten years on characterizing aviation emissions, although
major uncertainties remain, especially for particle emissions, and
the combined effect on ozone and methane through NO xemissions.
The spatial variability in the effects of the transport sectors is large,
not only because of the uneven distribution of emissions, but also
because of differences in ambient chemical and radiative regimes,
meteorological conditions, insolation, and surface properties.

The model groups involved in the QUANTIFY project have per-
formed detailed calculations of future impact from the transport
sectors. The studies focus on the time evolution between 2000 and
2050, based on the different SRES scenarios. QUANTIFY project
emission scenarios where provided for different transport sectors
(road trafﬁc, shipping and aviation) based on the IPCC SRES
scenarios A1, A2, B1, and B2 ( Nakicenovic et al., 2000 ). In addition,
a low emission scenario was provided for aviation assuming the
implementation of all available technology. The assumption is that
emissions of ozone precursors from road trafﬁc will drop to negli-
gible amounts during this century, due to emission reduction
technology. At the same time emissions from shipping and aviation
are expected to increase during coming decades, since improving
technology will not be able to compensate for the increased trafﬁc.
The climate impact from shipping is complex, since current emis-
sion trends lead to a global average negative radiative forcing
(see Section 6.2.1 ). Future climate impact will, to a large extent, be
determined by trend in emissions and on implementation of
emission regulations. It should be recognized that environmental
impact (on climate and air quality) from ships is local and regional
in nature due to contributions from short-lived compounds such as
sulfate aerosols. Dalsøren et al. (2007) have studied local effects of
ship emissions in coastal regions and in the Arctic from future
seaborne trafﬁc.
Collins et al. (2009) have calculated the impact from ship
emissions on atmospheric chemistry for the different land-based
emissions in 2000 and 2030, ACCENT PhotoComp, presented inSection 4.2.1 (Fig. 36 ). The three plots show the change in the
tropospheric ozone burden, production and methane lifetime due
to ship emission. Shipping has the largest effect when using
the 2030 MFR land-based scenario, a smaller impact when using
the 2000 or 2030 CLE and an even smaller effect when using the
high NO xSRES A2 scenario for the land-based emissions, illus-
trating the non-linearity of ozone chemistry with lower effects of
emissions when added to a higher background. The non-linearity is
stronger when looking at the change in the methane lifetime.
Collins et al. (2009) have also performed calculations showing the
effect of sulfur emissions, according to which the increase in sulfate
aerosols and sulfur deposition due to the SO 2from shipping will
offset 75% of the beneﬁts in air quality that would be expect from
land-based emission controls under the SRES A2 scenario.
6.2. Climate impact from the transport sectors
6.2.1. Impact from the different sectors
In general, emissions from the transport sectors increase ozone
and reduce methane. Ozone changes from the road sector result in
stronger forcing because of the more effective vertical mixing over
land that enhances the ozone change at higher altitudes where the
forcing efﬁciency is higher.
In a recent study Fuglestvedt et al. (2008) show, that the net RF due
to shiptrafﬁc from pre-industrialtimes to present is negative, opposite
to what is found for other sectors. Aerosols are the main reason for the
negative RF from shipping, but atmospheric reactive gases (e.g.,
methane) contribute to the negative RF. Fig. 37 depicts the combined
Fig. 34. Ozone change at the surface due to year 2000 ship emissions for January (top left), April (top right), July (bottom left), and October (bottom right) (f rom Dalsøren et al., 2007 ).I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5171RF from ozone changes and changes in methane. Ship emissions stand
out with a combined negative effect. The reason for this is that NO x
emissions from ship trafﬁc occur over pristine areas where OHenhances efﬁciently, causing a strong reduction in the CH
4lifetime and
concentration ( Dalsøren et al., 2009a; Fuglestvedt et al., 2008 ).
To investigate future impact, Fuglestvedt et al. (2008) have
integrated radiative forcing for a current emission over different
time horizons in order to compare the effect of different transport
sectors and chemical components.
Fig. 38 shows the integrated radiative forcing due to the various
components and sectors with a time horizon of 100 years, as used
in the Kyoto Protocol. According to Fuglestvedt et al. (2008) CO2is
by far the most important substance on this time scale, with the
largest contribution coming from road transport. The second
largest positive forcing comes from tropospheric ozone, again with
a dominating contribution from road transport. Changes in
methane and sulfate lead to a negative radiative forcing, with the
larges contributions coming from the shipping sector. On thechosen time scale of 100 years the contributions from the short-
lived and intermediate perturbations (ozone, aerosols, and
methane) become signiﬁcantly smaller compared with CO 2. Of the
100-year integrated net radiative forcing from total man made
emissions the net radiative forcing from transport amounts to 16%.
6.2.2. Comparison with other sectors
Recent studies have improved our understanding of the
contribution from various emission sectors and regions to RF fromozone and aerosol changes. Berntsen et al.(2006), Fuglestvedt et al.
(2008), Unger et al. (2008) estimated the contribution to ozone
radiative forcing. Unger et al. (2008) evaluated the RF due to ozone
for the year 2030 from 6 emission sectors, as indicated in Fig. 39
with the largest contribution from the transportation and biomass
burning sectors.
Koch et al. (2007) calculate the radiative forcing for the direct
aerosol from six different sectors. The impacts of present-day
aerosols emitted from particular regions and from particular

were studied. The conclusion from the work was that South-East
Asia exports over 2/3 of its emitted black carbon and sulphate
burden over the Northern Hemisphere. While Africa has the largest
biomass burning emissions, South America generates a larger
(about 20% of the global carbonaceous) aerosol burden; about 1/2
of this burden is exported and dominates the carbonaceous aerosolload in the Southern Hemisphere. The resulting calculated direct
anthropogenic radiative forcings are /C00.29, /C00.06, and 0.24 W m /C02
calculated for sulfate, organic, and black carbon, respectively. Fig. 40
shows the percentage radiative forcing from various sectors for BC,
OC, and sulfate. Two of the largest BC radiative forcings are from
residential (0.09 W m/C02) and transport (0.06 W m/C02) sectors,
making these potential targets to counter global warming suggested

power and industry sectors, and these sectors are responsible for the
large negative aerosol forcings over the central Northern Hemi-
sphere. Further studies have been performed by Shindell et al.
(2008a,b) , examining air quality (AQ) and radiative forcing due to
emissions reductions by economic sector for different regions.
6.3. The impact of large emission increases in South-East Asia
South-East Asia where emission of pollutants have increased
signiﬁcantly, particularly during the last decade, and where it is
likely that future emissions will continue to grow fast ( Isaksen
et al., 2009 ). These emissions are at such a high level that they have
the potential to markedly increase transport of ozone to the US
west coast ( Zhang et al., 2009 ), and reduce global methane levels
through enhanced OH levels ( Dalsøren et al., 2009b ). In the global
model study by Dalsøren et al. (2009b) perturbations in 2000 and
2006, and future (2020) perturbations of OH and methane lifetimesare calculated. The adopted NO
xemissions and results for the global
average changes in OH and methane lifetime are given. For details
of the adopted emissions in the model studies, see Dalsøren et al.
(2009a) . The high emission cases are based on the rapid growth in
energy use after 2000, and assumption of future signiﬁcant growth
(see also Isaksen et al., 2009 ). Note that due to the methane
response time of approximately 10 to 12 years to perturbation
changes, there will be a lag in the methane response to lifetime
changes.
In agreement with former studies it is found that global
anthropogenic emission changes have resulted in small changes in
OH and in methane lifetime from 1980 to 2000 ( Table 2 ). Asshown in Fig. 31 emission of NO x, a main OH precursor, has
decreased signiﬁcantly during this time period in Europe. The
model studies therefore indicate a signiﬁcant cancellation of the
increase in Southeast Asia from the overall global emission.
Comparison for 2000 with satellite measurements show that the
model is able to reproduce retrieved tropospheric NO 2columns
over Southeast Asia. In the high emission case the 2006 NO x
emissions were ﬁtted to the 2000–2006 increase in energyconsumption in China. This case shows better agreement with the
satellite retrieved 2000–2006 tropospheric NO
2column trend over
central and eastern China than the reference case. The satellite
comparison thereby highlights an issue noted in other studies: The
question addressed whether current emission inventories under-
estimate the recent increase in NO xemissions in Southeast Asia.
The development of global OH and methane due to emissionchanges in Southeast Asia after 2000 is also dependent on the
balance between changes in NO
xand CO emissions. From 2000 to
2006 the sign of OH and methane lifetime changes are different in
the reference case and the high NO xemission case. Though the
high NO xemission case is an upper estimate of OH changes it is
better than the reference scenario in reproducing measured NO 2
trends. From 2000 to 2020 the contributions from Southeast Asiaare moderate in the base scenario but much larger than the small
overall global emission impact from 1980 to 2000. In the 2020
high Southeast Asian NO
xemission case the impact on global OH
and methane is large. It is of comparable absolute magnitude to
the international ship trafﬁc ( Endresen et al., 2003; Dalsøren et al.,
2007; Dalsøren et al., 2009a ). The OH increase in Southeast Asia is
4.7% in the 2020 high NO xcase. Such a large change would have
a signiﬁcant effect on the oxidation of regional pollutants with
short and intermediate lifetimes.
Zhang et al. (2009) compiled a detailed anthropogenic emission
inventory for Asia for the spring 2006 period of INTEX-B but similar
toDalsøren et al. (2009b) used a higher estimate for Asian NO x
emissions by constraining them to satellite observations. Zhang
et al. (2009) found that Asian pollution enhanced surface ozone
concentrations by 5–7 ppbv over western North America in spring
2006. The 2000–2006 rise in Asian anthropogenic emissions
increased this inﬂuence by 1–2 ppbv.
6.4. Impact on the Arctic (Arctic Haze)
Human-induced climate–chemistry interactions could be of
particular importance in the Arctic. The Arctic has warmed more
rapidly during recent decades than most parts of the globe, and it is
projected to warm even more during the 21st century. During the
past 30 years, the extent of Arctic sea ice during the summer has
decreased by about 25% ( Stroeve et al., 2007 ), and the seasonal melt
area of the Greenland Ice Sheet has increased rapidly, by w7% per
decade since 1979. While much of the Arctic warming originates
from the same factors underlying global warming, studies suggest
that both tropospheric aerosols and ozone play an important role in
the Arctic.

Measurements of pollutants in the Arctic are relatively limited
compared to more populated mid-latitude regions. Long-term
(20–30 years) surface observations are available for ozone, sulfate,
BC and dust, though onlyfroma fewstations. Data fromAlert, Canada
show no appreciable trends during the 1980s, followed by decreases
in manyaerosols concentrations (sulfate, nitrate, sea-salt) during the
1990s ( Sirois and Barrie, 1999 ). Data from both Alert and Barrow,
Alaska show likewise decreasing BC during the 1990s, but suggest
that concentrations began to increase again around 2000 ( Sharma
et al., 2006 ). The trends in individual aerosol species are consistent
with observations of the overall light scattering by aerosols, which
peaks in spring as inﬂow of pollutants is large and near-surface
temperature inversions inhibit deposition, leading to the seasonal
aerosol build up known as Arctic Haze ( Iversen and Joranger, 1995 ).
Measurements of the Arctic Haze began in the late 1970s: they show
a maximum scattering during the 1980s and 1990s, followed by
decreases through around 2000 ( Quinn et al., 2007 ).
Ozone data from Barrow show a slightly increasing trend from
1975–1995, but they are not statistically signiﬁcant ( Oltmans et al.,
1998 ). In contrast, measurements of CO, the only ozone precursor
(other than methane) with long-term Arctic records, show
decreases at Northern high latitudes during the 1990s ( Novelli
et al., 1998 ). Only few long-term data on pollutants are available for
the Eastern Hemisphere side of the Arctic.
On much longer timescales, the recent analysis of black
carbon concentrations from a Greenland ice core has allowed
reconstruction of BC deposition since the late 18th century
(McConnell et al., 2007 ). These suggest that emissions in the main
source regions, North America, Europe and more recently (and to
a lesser extent) Asia, were extremely large in the early 1900s,
declined thereafter through the middle of the century, and
increased again during recent decades.
6.4.2. Climate impact of chemically and radiatively active
short-lived species in Arctic
As emissions within the Arctic are relatively small, most Arctic
pollution comes from distant sources. The relative importance of
pollutants located within the Arctic as compared with those at lower
latitudes is not clear, but remote radiative forcing appears to play
a large role ( Shindell et al., 2007 ). Direct radiative forcing due to
changes in pollutants located within the Arctic can also be
substantial, however, with seasonal values as large as 1 W m/C02
(Quinn et al., 2008 ). The contribution of various species to the total
preindustrial to present-day Arctic surface temperature trends
shows that BC, ozone and methane have together caused roughly as
much warming as CO 2, while reﬂective aerosols have caused
a cooling of comparable magnitude as seen in Fig. 41 . Shortwave
radiation is primarily perturbed via absorption by ozone and BC and
reﬂection by sulfate, OC and nitrate. Long wave ﬂuxes are affected by
ozone (and other greenhouse gases) and by aerosols. While aerosol
forcing is usually dominated by shortwave impacts, the long-wave
effects play a larger role at high latitudes during polar darkness
when observations show a distinct effect of Arctic Haze on thermal
radiation ( Ritter et al., 2005 ). Hence under Arctic conditions, aerosols
can sometimes have similar impacts as those to greenhouse gases.
Indirect effects of aerosols can also be large in the Arctic. One
prominent indirect effect is that of black carbon deposited onto
snow or ice surfaces, darkening them and reducing their albedo
(Warren and Wiscombe, 1980; Clarke and Noone, 1985; Jacobson,
2004 ). Another is the aerosol indirect effect on clouds, which can
lead to very large radiative forcings ( >3Wm/C02) by increasing cloud
cover under conditions of low insolation, which leads to a net
warming effect due to absorption of outgoing long-wave radiation
(Garrett and Zhao, 2006; Lubin and Vogelmann, 2006 ). There arelimited understanding of any of these indirect processes. For
example, aerosol indirect effects on clouds are not well character-
ized for ice phase clouds ( Quinn et al., 2008 ).
Forcing by Arctic aerosols has a strong seasonal variation for
both shortwave and long-wave components, while forcing by
ozone appears to maximize during boreal spring when Arctic ozone
abundances are comparatively large and sunlight is relatively
abundant ( Quinn et al., 2008 ).
7. Impact on tropospheric composition from climate change
and changes in stratospheric composition
Changes in climate have the potential to affect tropospheric
composition and the distribution in several ways. Changes in
circulation will alter the transport of pollutants, and in particular if
stagnant conditions during high pressure situations become more/
less frequent, conditions will be more/less favorable for the build
up of high pollutions levels (e.g., Royal Society, 2008; Matsueda
et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, higher temperatures will increase water
vapor with enhanced OH production, and lightning activities could
be enhanced in a warmer climate leading to enhanced NO x
production. Changes in surface characteristics (dryness, windspeed) will affect the exchange of components between the
biosphere and the atmosphere (see Fowler et al., 2009 ). Strato-
spheric/tropospheric exchange of, in particular, ozone is affected by
climate change, and also by changes in ozone depletion in the
stratosphere. For instance, the large stratospheric ozone depletion
in the 1980s and 1990s had an impact on stratosphere–troposphere
exchange and on ozone transport to the troposphere (e.g., van Noije
et al., 2004 ).
7.1. Impact of climate change on future tropospheric composition
7.1.1. Ozone and its precursors
Several modeling studies have investigated how future climate
change may impact tropospheric composition, ozone in particular.
An early study ( Thompson et al., 1989 ) suggested that increases in
water vapor, associated with warmer temperatures, would increase
the ﬂux through the reaction (R2: O (
1D)þH2O/2OH), enhancing
the loss of ozone and production of the hydroxyl radical. Subse-
quent work (e.g., Zeng and Pyle, 2003; Collins et al., 2003; Sudo
et al., 2003 ) additionally found that climate change led to an
increased ﬂux of ozone from the stratosphere to the troposphere.

day Arctic (60/C14to 90/C14N) surface temperature trends. Values are based on the assess-
ment of modeling and observations of Quinn et al. (2008) , and do not include aerosol
indirect effects. Reﬂective aerosols include sulfate and organic carbon.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5175More recent results from climate models, with detailed strato-
spheric dynamics have conﬁrmed that a more vigorous Brewer–
Dobson circulation (the large-scale circulation that exerts a major
control on stratosphere–troposphere exchange (STE)) is a robust
feature of models ( Butchart et al., 2006 ).Stevenson et al. (2006)
presented results from ten models that simulated the impact of
climate change between 2000 and 2030 on ozone. The main
climate feedback processes affecting ozone in these models
appeared to be the two discussed above. Some of the models were
dominated by the negative water vapor feedback, whilst the posi-
tive STE feedback was more prominent in others.
Changes in lightning (and associated NO xproduction) in
connection with climate change have been studied. Most model
studies show an increase in lightning as climate warms ( Schumann
and Huntrieser, 2007 ), with increases of up to 60% per degree K of
global mean surface warming ( Lamarque et al., 2005 ), although
other studies have shown no global trend, just a geographical shift
from tropics to mid-latitudes ( Stevenson et al., 2005 ), or decreases
(Jacobson and Streets, 2009 ). Other studies show similar discrep-
ancies, with no clear conclusions on climate change and lightning
activity. Observations show no relationship between surface
temperature and lightning in the tropics, but a strong positive
correlation over Northern Hemisphere land areas ( Reeve and
Toumi, 1999 ). Some studies suggest that increases in lightning may
be the dominant climate-related driver of future upper tropo-
spheric O 3increases ( Wu et al., 2008a ).Wild (2007) demonstrated
that changes in lightning NO xemissions had a large inﬂuence over
the tropospheric ozone burden.
Biogenic VOC emissions are a function of temperature, photo-
synthetically available radiation (PAR), leaf area index (LAI) and
plant species ( Guenther et al., 1995, 2006 ). Several global chemistry
models account for some or all of these dependencies (e.g. Hau-
glustaine et al., 2005; Stevenson et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2008a ). Most
models show an increase in tropospheric O 3as VOC emissions rise,
particularly in regions with relatively high NO xlevels; however, in
low NO xregions, O 3often decreases. VOC degradation chemistry
inﬂuences ozone’s sensitivity to VOC emissions, in particular
whether isoprene nitrate formation represents a temporary or
terminal sink for NO x(Giacopelli et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2008b ).
Horowitz et al. (2007) present observational evidence that isoprene
nitrates do permanently remove NO x, and in models that reﬂect
this ﬁnding, the surface O 3response to rising biogenic VOC emis-
sions quite rapidly saturates ( Wu et al., 2008b ), and can even result
in O 3reductions. For example, Wu et al. (2008b) ﬁnd that future
surface O 3levels in the SE US are reduced as isoprene emissions
rise. One study by Arneth et al. (2007) links biogenic VOC emissions
also to CO 2levels ( Arneth et al., 2007 ) and land-use change. The
process is not well known, and has generally not yet been consid-
ered in global models.
Changes in the biosphere associated with climate change may
have other important effects. Soil NO xemissions, produced from
bacterial activity, are likely to increase as the land warms ( Granier
et al., 2003; Hauglustaine et al., 2005; Liao et al., 2006; Wu et al.,
2008a ). Changes in the hydrological cycle, and in particular soil
moisture, may signiﬁcantly affect stomatal opening and hence dry
deposition ﬂuxes of ozone and other gases (e.g., Solberg et al.,
2008 ). Enhanced deposition will occur under wetter conditions and
visa versa. Increases in CO 2levels may reduce stomatal opening and
hence ozone deposition ( Sanderson et al., 2007 ). Furthermore,
higher temperatures will increase evaporative anthropogenic VOC
emissions (e.g., Rubin et al., 2006 ).
Trendsin cloud optical depth, aerosol loading and the solar cycle in
the tropics ( Chandra et al., 1999; Fusco and Logan, 2003 ) might
modulate troposphericozone to someextent. Climate relatedchanges
in temperature, humidity, meteorology, and land use/vegetation canalso affect ozone. Fusco and Logan (2003) estimate a 3% ozone
increase over Western Europe and 1% decline over much of North
America due to 1970–1995 temperature increase and decrease
respectively. The overall change in tropospheric ozone due to climate
change since the pre-industrial period was positive in 5 of 6 studies in
a model assessment ( Gauss et al., 2006 ). However, model studies
based on future scenarios taking into account climate changes
(Hauglustaine et al., 2005; Stevenson et al., 2006; Dentener et al.,
2005; Dentener et al., 2006c ) report a signiﬁcantly reduced global
tropospheric burden due to the effects of climate change, partly as
a result of enhanced OH formation. It should however be noted that
the signs of the changes vary in different regions of the troposphere
both for past and future changes.
More prolonged and frequent occurrence of heat waves of the
type experienced over Western Europe in August 2003 is expected
to occur in a future warmer climate. Solberg et al. (2008) applied
meteorological data in a global scale Chemical Transport Model
(the Oslo CTM2), covering the heat wave period, and showed that
under such extreme weather situations large ozone levels build up
in the planetary boundary layer with current emissions for
extended time periods (in excess of 100 ppb for several days). If the2003 heat wave is taken as a proxy for more frequent severe
weather situations during future warmer climates, the effect of
measures to control regional pollution could be strongly reduced.
7.1.2. Methane
The natural source of methane from wetlands is climate-sensi-
tive ( Gedney et al., 2004; Shindell et al., 2004 ). Changes in hydroxyl
radical (OH) concentrations directly affect the rate of methane
oxidation. Higher levels of water vapor lead to higher levels of OH
(reaction (R2)). The reaction of methane with OH is strongly
temperature dependent, and proceeds faster at higher tempera-
tures. Several model studies have noted the negative feedback of
climate on methane through these mechanisms (e.g., Johnson et al.,
2001; Stevenson et al., 2005 ). All ten of the models in Stevenson
et al. (2006) showed a reduction in the methane lifetime in
a warmer climate, with an average reduction of 4% for a global
mean surface warming of around 0.7 K.
Thawing of permafrost represents a potential signiﬁcant source
of methane to the atmosphere, and may constitute a positive
feedback mechanism in the climate–chemistry system ( Osterkamp,
2005; Lawrence and Slater, 2005; Walter et al., 2006a,b ). With
strongly enhancing temperatures in the Arctic, permafrost degra-
dation has been observed to occur rapidly ( Jorgensen et al., 2006 ),
and methane has been observed to be bubbling from melting lakes
at an increasing rate ( Walter et al., 2006a,b ). Large amounts of
organic carbon are stored in the permafrost, which partly is con-
verted to methane and emitted to the atmosphere, following the
thawing of the permafrost ( Walter et al., 2006a,b; Zimov et al.,
2006 ). There is a non-linear response in atmospheric methane
concentrations to enhanced emissions, currently giving an addi-
tional 40% increase in atmospheric concentrations (positive feed-
back) ( Prather and Ehhalt, 2001 ). The non-linear feedback is likely
to be much larger with strong enhancements in methane concen-
trations, since a larger fraction of the OH loss is through the
methane reaction. Methane emissions over periods of decades toseveral centuries in connection with permafrost thawing ( Walter
et al., 2006a,b ), combined with a methane lifetime of the order of 10
years, makes the impact of methane permafrost emissions depends
critically on the time horizon of permafrost thawing. Similar and
rapid impact on methane can occur if large amounts of methane
trapped as methane hydrates under Arctic sea ice (
Buffett and
Archer,2 0 0 4 ) are released following ocean temperature increases
and extensive sea ice melting. Although the contributions from the
described processes are uncertain, observations of emission fromI.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5176melting permafrost lakes, nevertheless show increase, although at
a small rate compared with other methane sources ( Walter et al.,
2006a,b ). Sea ice melting in the Arctic is recently found to be faster
than predicted ( Stroeve et al., 2007 ).
7.1.3. Aerosol
A few studies have considered the effects of climate change on
aerosol concentrations. Higher levels of oxidants tend to increase
secondary aerosol formation rates ( Stevenson et al., 2005; Unger
et al., 2006; Tsigaridis and Kanakidou, 2007 ). Changes in the
hydrological cycle have strong regional inﬂuences on wet removal
processes, generally increasing wet deposition ( Liao et al., 2006;
Racherla and Adams, 2006 ). The thermodynamic equilibrium of
some aerosol species may be shifted by changes in climate ( Liao
et al., 2006 ). Some sources of aerosols, such as biomass burning,
may increase as climate warms ( Jacob and Winner, 2009 ).
Following the A2 scenario, global aerosol burdens are reduced by
20% (2100–2000) in the study of Liao et al. (2006) , and by 2–18%
(2050–1990) in that of Racherla and Adams (2006) , mainly due to
enhanced deposition.
Feedback mechanisms between the physical climate state
(wind, land cover, ice cover, vegetation distribution and tempera-
ture), and natural emissions lead to changes in aerosol abundances
(dust loads, sea salt and biogenic organic aerosols) ( Mahowald and
Luo, 2003; Jones et al., 2007; Tsigaridis and Kanakidou, 2007 ). The
quantiﬁcation of such changes will require considerable research
efforts on relevant parameterizations in global models, in order to
deﬁne credible scenarios including such feedbacks.
Large uncertainties still exist in terms of natural emissions, e.g.,
DMS from the oceans and hydrocarbons from land vegetation, and
their response to climate change. There are also large uncertainties
in the contribution of biomass burning, which occurs both naturally
and due to human activity and is characterized by large inter-
annual variations, thus complicating trend analyses.
7.1.4. Effects of climate change on Arctic composition
Climate change can inﬂuence Arctic pollutants in many ways.
Changes in the transport of pollutants to the Arctic region could
occur because enhanced polar warming would reduce the gradient
between the Arctic and lower latitude pollutant source regions,
facilitating transport which is currently limited by the polar front
(constant potential temperature surfaces which intersect the
Earth’s surface and form a dome over the polar region) ( Stohl,
2006 ). Additionally, climate models generally project an enhance-
ment of the strength of Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude west-
erly winds associated with the large climate variability patterns of
the North Atlantic Oscillation and Northern Annular Mode ( Miller
et al., 2006 ), which would lead to enhanced transport of pollutants
to the Arctic ( Eckhardt et al., 2003; Duncan and Bey, 2004; Sharma
et al., 2006 ).
Emissions of ozone precursors in and near the Arctic may also
increase as boreal regions warm and forest ﬁre frequency increases.
Release of methane from enhanced boreal wetland productivity is
an additional possible consequences of Arctic warming, whose
effects would however be global given methane’s long lifetime. The
retreat of Arctic sea ice cover during springtime is also likely to alterthe ozone-depleting halogen chemistry that takes place in the
marine boundary layer ( Simpson et al., 2007 ).
The relative importance of climate-induced changes on Arctic
pollutants versus anthropogenic emission changes will clearly
depend upon future emissions. A shift of pollutant emissions from
industrialized nations to developing nations at lower latitudes is
already taking place. This may have a greater impact on pollutant
transport to the Arctic than the climate-induced changes discussed
above as pollution transport from lower latitude Asian sources issubstantially less efﬁcient per unit emission than transport from
Europe ( Stohl, 2006; Shindell et al., 2008a,b ). Furthermore,
substantial increases in local emissions are possible under
a scenario where shipping in the Arctic ocean increases substan-
tially as sea ice cover retreats ( Granier et al., 2006; Dalsøren et al.,
2007 ). Hence much work remains to better understand climate–
chemistry interactions in the Arctic and to project their role in
future Arctic climate change.
7.2. Impact of stratospheric changes on tropospheric composition
The stratosphere can affect tropospheric ozone by direct
downward transport of stratospheric high-ozone air, and by
changes in the stratospheric ozone column affecting the penetra-
tion of UV radiation, and hence tropospheric photolysis rates.
Changes in the stratosphere can also affect tropospheric circulation
patterns particularly in the polar regions such as Antarctic
circumpolar westerly winds (e.g., Perlwitz et al., 2008 ), and the
Arctic oscillation ( Hess and Lamarque, 2007 ), and hence indirectly
affect tropospheric ozone distributions.
7.2.1. Contributions of stratosphere–troposphere exchange
to the tropospheric ozone budget
Irreversible exchange of air between the stratosphere and
troposphere occurs largely in synoptic scale events. Global esti-
mates have been made using correlations between N 2O and O 3(e.g.,
Murphy and Fahey,1994 ), by 3D chemistry models (e.g., Roelofs and
Lelieveld, 1995; Jo ¨ckel et al., 2006 ), and by combining satellite
ozone observations with meteorological analyses (e.g., Olsen et al.,
2003 ). These typically give ﬂuxes in the range 450–600 Tg(O 3)y r/C01.
However there are some discrepancies in the deﬁnition of the ﬂux.
Some studies quote a ﬂux through a ﬁxed pressure level, others
through a PV surface. Many tropospheric chemistry models use the
150 ppbv ozone surface as a deﬁnition of the tropopause.
Stevenson et al. (2006) assessed the ozone budgets of 26
tropospheric chemistry models. They inferred the STE ﬂux in the
models across the 150 ppbv ozone surface by assuming a balance
between the stratospheric input, net chemical production and dry
deposition of ozone. The results gave a mean STE ozone ﬂux of
552 Tg yr/C01with a range of 151–930 Tg yr/C01. This compares to
a mean tropospheric chemical production of 5110 Tg yr/C01. Hence
STE contributes about 10% to the total tropospheric ozone budget.
This does not necessarily mean that STE contributes 10% to the
tropospheric burden since the ozone is injected into the upper
troposphere where the ozone lifetime is longer. By tagging strato-
spheric ozone in their model simulation, Sudo and Akimoto (2007)
calculated that STE contributed 23% to the tropospheric ozone
burden. Variations in STE account for 25% of the variance in the
tropospheric ozone burden between models ( Wild, 2007 ).
7.2.2. Trends in STE
The exchange of mass between the stratosphere and tropo-
sphere depends on the Brewer–Dobson circulation in the strato-
sphere (upwelling in the tropics, downwelling in the extra-tropics),which is driven by extra-tropical wave forcing. A study by Butchart
and Scaife (2001) found that the rate of global mass exchange
between the stratosphere and troposphere will increase by 3% per
decade in future. They put this down to an increased wave forcing
from more vigorous extra-tropical planetary waves in the warmer
climate. The overall trend of the Brewer–Dobson circulation is
a consistent feature of coupled chemistry climate models. Butchart
et al. (2006) estimated an average 2% per decade increase in the
tropical upwelling in 11 models over the 21st century.
The ozone concentrations in the lower stratosphere depend on
chemistry and transport, and could be strongly inﬂuenced byI.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5177climate change. Zeng and Pyle (2003) found a substantial increase
in lower stratospheric ozone, with a future climate in their model
with a top at 36 km. Another study, using a model with an 85 km
top, found that while lower temperatures increased ozone in the
upper stratosphere, this reduced the lower stratospheric ozone as
less UV could penetrate to the lower levels.
7.2.3. Trends in tropospheric ozone
Collins et al. (2003), Sudo et al. (2003) andZeng and Pyle (2003)
found that STE of ozone by 2100 would increase by 40%, 130% and
80% respectively. These models were tropospheric chemistry
models with tops between 36 and 40 km. The three studies
investigated changes in both circulation and lower stratospheric
ozone. In all these cases the change in lower stratospheric ozone
had a large effect on STE. Increased water vapor in a warmer climate
is expected to increase destruction of tropospheric ozone, but in the
above three studies increased STE partially or completely offset the
increased destruction. In the Stevenson et al. (2006) model inter-
comparison, models had varying methods of accounting for STE of
ozone. These gave STE increases with 2030s climate of 0–19%.
Recent trends in tropospheric ozone may be at least partly due
to changes in the lower stratosphere. Ordo´n˜ez et al. (2007) have
shown that a 16%/decade trend in lowermost stratospheric ozone
over Europe (1992–2004) correlates well with a 5–10%/decade
trend in lower tropospheric background ozone ( Fig. 42 ).
Stratospheric ozone depletion and its subsequent recovery will
affect lower stratospheric concentrations and hence inﬂux of ozone
into the troposphere. Ozone depletion may have offset two thirds of
the tropospheric ozone burden increase from pre-industrial times
to the present day, according to Shindell et al. (2006) . They also
suggest that of their expected 124% increase in STE in future, only
33% is due to climate change, the rest is due to ozone recovery.
7.2.4. Impact of UV changes
Since chemical processes in the troposphere are initiated by
solar UV-B penetration into the troposphere, changes in strato-
spheric ozone could affect the impact on the tropospheric oxida-
tion. Available measurements show that surface UV radiation levels
have generally increased with a geographic pattern similar to the
observed reductions in stratospheric ozone. In addition surface UV
levels will be strongly inﬂuenced by cloud cover, local ground
albedo and the atmospheric aerosol content. UV increases lead toan enhanced OH production, which reduces the lifetime of
methane and inﬂuences ozone production and loss rates. The
impact on ozone is more complex ( Isaksen et al., 2005 ). While
decreased ozone columns, enhanced surface ozone in polluted
regions, surface ozone decreased in pristine background regions
with low NO x.Collins et al. (2009) showed that during summer
with very high NO xlevels titration lowered ozone production.
Shindell et al. (2006) calculated that ozone depletion since 1979
had increased OH levels by 3.5%. This would correspond to a 5%
decrease in methane concentrations (using the factor 1.4 feedback
adjustment, from Prather and Ehhalt (2001), and assuming initial
reduction in methane lifetime is the same as the global OH
increase). Conversely ozone recovery would be expected to
increase methane and hence tropospheric ozone.
8. Cross cutting issues (policy relations, integration)
The 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) states that policies and measures to address a human-
induced climate change shall stabilize atmospheric concentrations
of greenhouse gases (GHGs) ‘‘at a level that would preventdangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system’’
(Art. 2), and that the measures should be ‘‘comprehensive’’ and
‘‘cost-effective’’ (Art. 3.3). Article 2 forms the basis for determining
the total reductions in emissions. However, due to incomplete
understanding of the climate system it is difﬁcult to determine the
appropriate level of mitigation. One major issue is the possibility
that natural ﬂuctuations such as the solar forcing have contributed
signiﬁcantly to the observed global temperature increase. One way
to assure Comprehensiveness and Cost-effectiveness as stated in
Article 3.3 is to allow ﬂexibility with respect to which species
should be mitigated. This requires an emission metric whereby the
global impact of emissions of different gases or aerosols with
different atmospheric lifetimes and different radiative properties
can be compared and weighted.
In the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the target is formulated in terms of
‘‘CO
2equivalents’’ using the Global Warming Potential (GWP)
metric concept. The principle of comprehensiveness and cost
effectiveness are made operative as the aggregate anthropogenic
carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of six speciﬁed GHGs or
groups of GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous
oxide (N 2O), hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFCs), perﬂuorocarbons (PFCs)
and sulfur hexaﬂuoride (SF 6) (Art. 3.1, Annex A). Note that apart
from being used in binding agreements emission metrics can also
be used to form a basis for common understanding of the climate
impact that can be used for example when new technology stan-
dards are developed.
While a number of interactions between atmospheric chemistry
and climate are now recognized, quantifying these interactions and
their relative importance is more difﬁcult and many uncertainties
remain. Part of the difﬁculty in fully quantifying the relative
importance of different climate–chemistry interactions is that the
composition of the atmosphere and the climate processes are
strongly coupled, thus a change in the emissions or concentration
of one gas or particle can feedback on the atmospheric composition
and climate in multiple ways. Furthermore, the large variability
both in time and space in the secondary compounds like ozone and
sulfate and organic particles make the quantiﬁcation of the
climate–chemistry interactions and adopting suitable metric for
policy measures highly complex.
8.1. Climatic response to solar forcing: overview of theories
Variations in solar activity may give rise to changes in Earth’s
atmosphere both in terms of energy as well as its composition.
Fig. 42. 12-month running means of the normalized monthly anomalies with respect
to the 1992–2004 mean annual cycle of lower free tropospheric ozone (blue) at (top)Jungfraujoch and (bottom) Zugspitze, and 150 hPa ( w13.6 km altitude) ozone averaged
for Payerne and Hohenpeissenberg (red). From Ordo´n˜ez et al., 2007 .I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5178Furthermore, some hypotheses suggest that cloud formation and
the creation of cloud condensation nuclei may be linked indirectly to
the level of solar activity through the action of galactic cosmic rays.
The notion that changes in the sun may affect weather on Earth
is old and can be traced back to early discussions in the late 17th
century ( Benestad, 2002 ). It was established in 1896 (Kristian Bir-
keland) that Aurora was connected to the solar activity, and in more
modern times an unequivocal response has been found in the
upper atmosphere ( Labitzke, 1987; Labitzke and van Loon, 1988;
Haigh, 1994, 2003; Salby and Callagan, 2000, 2004; Shindell et al.,
1999, 2001 ). But no deﬁnite and convincing evidence has yet been
found suggesting a strong link for the troposphere and Earth’s
surface climate, although changes in the temperature structure in
the stratosphere may affect the planetary wave dynamics and
hence the advection of heat.
There have been many speculations over the past centuries
about a solar connection to variations in quantities such as
temperature, precipitation, and sea level pressure, and attempts to
ﬁnd a solar link. Friis-Christensen & Lassen (1991) presented an
analysis suggesting a strong association between the warming over
the 20th century in the northern hemisphere and the solar cycle
length, but Laut (2003) andDamon & Laut (2004) reported errors in
their analysis and argued that their conclusions were invalid.
Subsequent analysis by Benestad (2005) also failed to reproduce
their results. Furthermore, it is not clear how the temperature on
Earth would be sensitive to the solar cycle length and exact which
physical processes that would be involved.
Analysis by Crook and Gray (2005a,b) andLean and Rind (2008)
found a solar cycle signature in climatic variables, although these
were weak compared to the internal variability. Furthermore,
simulations with general circulation models (GCMs) also suggest
a solar response, albeit modest ( Cubash et al., 1997; Meehl et al.,
2003 ). The level of solar activity is estimated to be high for this
millennium ( Solanki et al., 2004 ), however, direct modern instru-
ment measurements indicate that the level of solar activity has not
increased signiﬁcantly over the last 30–50 years ( Richardson et al.,
2002; Lockwood and Fro ¨lich, 2007; Benestad, 2005 ).
Traditional studies have relied on empirical evidence and
sunspot observations. More recently, additional indices as well as
more physical variables, such as the total solar irradiance (TSI) and
magnetic indices ( Lockwoo, 2002 ) have been included in similar
analyses. The level of solar output is however, still uncertain ( Lean,
2006 ), and although several reconstructions of past variations have
been published ( Lean et al., 1995; Lean, 2004; Wang et al., 2005 ),
there are still holes in our knowledge of past variations in solar
forcings. Forster et al. (2007) estimated a radiative forcing due to an
increase in TSI (1750–2005) of þ0.12 (0.06–0.18) W m/C02(90%
conﬁdence interval).
There are three main explanations for how changes in the sun
may affect Earth’s climate: (a) direct effect from TSI, (b) strato-
spheric response ( Haigh,1994, 2003 ), and (c) modiﬁcation of clouds
through shielding of galactic cosmic rays (GCR; Dickinson, 1975;
Carslaw et al., 2002; Marsh and Svensmark, 2000 ).
Climatic response involving the stratosphere is believed to
involve chemical reactions in the stratosphere (e.g. ozone), and the
fact that solar UV varies strongly over a solar cycle compared to the
total solar irradiance strongly suggests a mechanisms involving
both atmospheric chemistry and a response in the atmospheric
dynamics (e.g. wave propagation). However, the importance of this
mechanism depends on whether the variations in the stratosphere
have an inﬂuence on the lower troposphere.
While the direct TSI effect and stratospheric mechanism have
been investigated in several modeling studies, the effect of GCR has
been difﬁcult to test in the GCMs. One problem with GCR and
clouds is that the physical mechanisms are poorly known, andneither is it ﬁrmly established whether the GCR mechanism takes
place in Earth’s atmosphere. There have been several studies
questioning the hypothesis due to a lack of empirical basis ( Krist-
ja´nsson et al., 2008; Sloan and Wolfendale, 2008; Erlykin et al.,
2009 ), but also some suggesting an effect of GCRs on clouds ( Har-
rison and Stephenson, 2006; Knudsen and Riisager, 2009 ).
However, the fact that clouds may be affected by either GCR or the
atmospheric electric ﬁeld does not necessarily imply the mecha-
nism proposed by Marsh and Svensmark (2000) , where GCR is
alleged to produce higher low-cloud coverage, higher planetary
albedo, and hence lower temperatures. Pierce and Adams (2009)
attempted to model the effect of GCR on the low clouds, but found
that the changes from the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) due to
changes in the GCR were two orders of magnitude too small to
account for the observed variations in the cloud properties. For
instance, while Knudsen and Riisager (2009) reported high corre-
lation between18O records and the Earth’s magnetic dipole
moment and concluded that the tropical precipitation has been
inﬂuenced by variations in the geomagnetic ﬁeld, they also argued
that their ﬁndings gives some support to the link between GCR
particles, cloud formation, and climate. However, if GCRs result inan increase in the planetary albedo and hence a cooler climate, it is
unclear how this could lead to higher rainfall in the tropics. On the
other hand, the rainfall in the region of their study is strongly linked
to the Monsoon system, and a latitudinal shift in the position of the
system can easily translate into large increases or decreases locally.
There have also been other claims of strong solar-terrestrial links
even over the most recent decades (e.g. Scafetta and West, 2005 ),
but these are controversial and have been disputed ( Lean, 2006;
Benestad and Schmidt, 2009 ). Furthermore, a lack of trend in the
GCR since 1952 suggests that GCR is not responsible for the most
recent global warming ( Benestad, 2005 ), and recent trends in the
stratosphere further disagree with the notion of recently enhanced
levels of solar activity ( IPCC, 2007 ).
8.2. Metrics
8.2.1. Deﬁnition of a metric
In general the ‘‘CO
2equivalents’’ emissions of any component is
not linked exclusively to the GWP metric, but can be derived for any
metric M by
EmðCO2/C0eqÞ¼ Emi$Mi (1)
Where Miis the metric value for component iand Emiis the emis-
sions of component i. The metric value ( Mi) will not ensure CO 2-
equivalence in all aspects of climate change, but only with respect to
the deﬁnition of the metric ( O’Neill, 2000 ). For example the climate
impact of emissions of 1 kg of methane (with GWP 100¼25) is only
equal to that of 25 kg emission of CO 2in that the integrated radiative
forcing over 100 years after the emissions are equal. The more the
physical properties (e.g., atmospheric lifetime) of component i
deviates from that of CO 2(e.g., as for NO xand aerosols) the larger
differences can be expected for other climate impacts (e.g., on other
timescales) than the impacts that deﬁnes the metric.
The Kyoto Protocol excludes emissions of short-lived species
including all types of aerosols, or their precursors, despite the fact
that they are believed to contribute signiﬁcantly to climate change.
This could weaken efforts to mitigate climate change by weakening
the comprehensive approach embodied in the UNFCCC; indeed, the
U.S. administration has cited the absence of black carbon and
tropospheric ozone from the Protocol as one reason why they have
not become signatories. The absence could also lead to a distortion
(for example, away from economically more efﬁcient measures) of
priorities in emission reductions.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5179It is important to stress that the choice of a given metric do not
deﬁne the policy – they are tools that enable implementation of the
policy. However, different policy frameworks require different
metric concepts (e.g., Manne and Richels, 2001; Fuglestvedt et al.,
2003; Shine et al., 2007; IPCC, 2009 ). For example the Global
Temperature Potential (GTP, Shine et al., 2005 ) is more consistent
with a climate policy with a long-term temperature target (e.g., EU
2/C14C target) than the GWP metric used in the Kyoto Protocol.
8.2.2. Special challenges for metrics of chemically active
short-lived species
Inclusion of chemically active short-lived components like
aerosols and ozone precursors together with long-lived greenhouse
gases in a climate policy using a common metric concept gives rise
to several challenges. There are signiﬁcant uncertainties in our
quantitative understanding of the climate impacts for these species.
This includes quantitative and even qualitative understanding of
the many chemical and physical indirect effects. As an example of
indirect effects, the current deﬁnition of GWP 100for methane that is
in operational use in the Kyoto Protocol, includes indirect effects on
ozone and stratospheric water vapor ( IPCC, 2001; Forster et al.,
2007 ), but there may be further indirect effects of ozone on the
carbon-cycle as discussed in Section 5.1.3 (Sitch et al., 2007 ). In
addition, and maybe more importantly, there are also more
fundamental methodological issues caused by the very wide
range of lifetimes for the chemically active species compared to the
long-lived greenhouse gases including CO 2. An emission pulse of
a short-lived component will naturally give a climate response on
a much shorter time scale. The climate response is dominated by
the response time of the mixed layer of the ocean, i.e. 5–10 years
(e.g., Hartmann, 1996 ).
Emissions of short-lived components will not lead to globally or
hemispheric scale well mixed increases. A global metric value for
each component as indicated in equation (1)(and applied in the
form of GWPs in the Kyoto Protocol) may not be applicable to short-
lived components, and metric values that are regionally dependent
and possibly also time (e.g., seasonally) dependent should be used.
However, policy makers may decide that metric values that depend
on region and time are too difﬁcult to handle in a negotiation
process and instead accept the inaccuracies that are embedded in
a global metric value if inclusion of short-lived species is deemed to
be important.
Radiative forcing is the basis for the GWP metric based on the
assumption that other climate impacts such as global mean
temperature increase is scaling linearly with radiative forcing, i.e.
that the efﬁcacy (cf. Section 5) is equal for all forcing mechanisms.
For most of the short-lived components there are indications that
the efﬁcacy is relatively close to 1.0 ( Hansen et al., 2005 ;Forster
et al., 2007 ), there are indications that the efﬁcacy can be signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced for forcing mechanisms that is spatially correlated
with regions of strong feedbacks or if species speciﬁc processes are
involved. In particular will black carbon aerosols that are deposited
on snow trigger a strong snow-albedo feedback with efﬁcacy esti-
mates in the range from 1.8 to 3.5 ( Hansen et al., 2004; Flanner
et al., 2007 ). If indirect cloud effects of aerosols, except the cloud–
albedo effect (e.g., the cloud lifetime and semi-direct effects) arenot considered as forcing mechanisms but rather as feedbacks (as
inForster et al., 2007 ) the net effect of these emissions may have
a quite different efﬁcacy than the LLGHGs.
Chemically active components and aerosols frequently cause
negative radiative forcing and thus a cooling. For some compo-
nents like SO
2and organic carbon aerosols there will be a net
cooling, while for other like NO xthe warming (ozone) and cooling
(decreased methane through increased OH and formation of
nitrate aerosols) effects can be of similar magnitude. In the case ofNOxthe warming and cooling may cancel on a global and time-
integrated level, but since the methane perturbation is much more
long-lived, the cooling will affect both hemispheres while the
warming will mainly be conﬁned to the hemisphere where NO xis
emitted. To what extent these cooling effects should be included
in the metric values and thus in a policy aimed at reducing global
warming is basically a political questions. For instance, whether or
not to include SO 2with a negative metric value is in many ways
similar to the discussion about the use of geo-engineering to
mitigate global warming ( Crutzen, 2006; Rasch et al., 2008;
Latham et al., 2008 ).
Emissions of chemically active short-lived species often lead to
other non-climate environmental effects such as degradation of air
quality, acid deposition and eutrophication. To the extent that these
effects do not inﬂuence the climate parameter used to calculate the
metric value, these effects should not be included in the metric
value, but will, of course, in the end affect the policy development.
As discussed above there are signiﬁcant uncertainties in our
quantitative understanding of the climate impact of the chemically
active short-lived species. A metric that is to be used in binding
agreements needs to be relatively transparent and robust, robustin the sense that the scientiﬁc understanding must be sufﬁciently
mature so that the metric value is not expected to change signif-
icantly with every new study. The many indirect effects are
probably the main source of uncertainty (e.g. indirect aerosol
effects, Section 5.4).
8.2.3. Examples of published metrics
Metrics have been developed by economists based on different
kinds of optimization frameworks such as cost-beneﬁt analysis
(e.g., Kandlikar, 1995 ) and cost-effectiveness (e.g., Manne and
Richels, 2001 ). Common for these metrics is that mitigation cost
estimates and discount rates are needed and in the case of cost-
beneﬁt analysis also damage costs (could be positive or negative) of
climate change are needed. These cost estimates are highly
uncertain, and the determination of an appropriate discount rate is
highly controversial.
Purely physical metrics have also been developed, the Global
Warming Potential (GWP) being the most widely known and used
through its inclusion in the Kyoto Protocol. The AGWP(H) (Absolute
GWP) of a component iis deﬁned as the integrated radiative forcing
over a given time horizon (H) following a pulse emission of 1 kg of i.
AGWP iðHÞ¼ZH
0RFiðtÞ$dt (2)
where RF iis the radiative forcing following a pulse emission of 1 kg
ofiatt¼0. The GWP iis deﬁned as the ratio of AGWP iand the AGWP
for CO 2which is used as a reference gas.
If component iis decaying with a constant lifetime then
AGWP iðHÞ¼ aiZH
0CiðtÞdt¼aiZH
0C0$e/C0t=s$dt (3)
where aiis the radiative efﬁciency (RF per unit concentration
change) and Ci(t) is the concentration perturbation following
a pulse emission of 1 kg of i,C0is the initial concentration pertur-
bation at t¼0 and sis the lifetime of component i.
A second purely physical metric, the Global Temperature
Potential (GTP) has more recently been proposed ( Shine et al.,
2005 ). The AGTP(H) (absolute GTP) is deﬁned as the temperature
perturbation (global annual mean) at time H following a pulse
emission at time t¼0 of 1 kg of component i. As for the GWP the
GTP is deﬁned as the ratio of AGTP iand the AGTP for CO 2. To deriveI.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5180values for the GTP metric knowledge of the temporal response of
the climate system to a perturbation is needed. Several methods
have been proposed and used ( Shine et al., 2005; Shine et al., 2007;
Boucher and Reddy, 2008; Berntsen and Fuglestvedt, 2008 ), using
both simple analytical climate models and impulse response
functions ﬁtted to AOGCMs. Consensus about what is the appro-
priate method has not yet been established.
Fig. 43 shows examples of published and derived metric values
for NO xand BC particles (see Fuglestvedt et al., in press ). For NO xit
is the indirect effects through ozone formation (positive RF), and
decrease in methane lifetime (negative RF) that is included. Due to
the integrating nature of the GWP concept the strong, but short-
term, positive RF caused by ozone production have a strong impact
on the GWP even with a 100 year time horizon. For the GTP metric
even after 20 years most of the warming of the ozone has dis-
appeared and the more long-term cooling of methane reductions
dominates giving negative GTP values.
Tol et al. (2008) show that the purely physical metrics GWP and
GTP are special cases that can be derived through a number of
simpliﬁcations from a cost-beneﬁt analysis (GWP) and a cost-
effective analysis (GTP).
Although there are signiﬁcant uncertainties and it can be dis-
cussed if the GWP and GTP concepts are appropriate measures of
the climate impacts due to emissions short-lived chemically active
components, the metric values can be readily calculated based on
results from chemistry-transport models (CTM) of GCMs with
chemistry. Fuglestvedt et al. ( in press) give an overview of metric
values for both the GWP and GTP for ozone precursors, SO 2, and
carbonaceous aerosols with some information about regional
differences.
8.3. Future directions for climate–chemistry research
8.3.1. The role of model-observation and model-model comparisons
Studies of future climate–chemistry interactions rely heavily on
how models can reproduce distribution and changes in the chem-
ical active greenhouse gases. It has been demonstrated that there
are signiﬁcant uncertainties with the models, which should be
demonstrated by a couple of examples: The global tropospheric
concentration of OH, which is a key component in tropospheric
oxidation, show large spread in the comparison given in Fig. 14
(Shindell et al., 2006 ). Likewise, aerosol burdens in state of the art
models, given in Fig. 23 (the AeroCom experiment), reveal large
uncertainties in model estimates.
One of the key ﬁrst steps in quantifying climate–chemistry
interactions and perform assessments of coupled climate–chemistrymodels is to improve the modeling tools through extensive
comparisons with observations. Some past efforts have already been
made towards assessing CCMs, including Austin et al. (2003), Eyring
et al. (2005a,b, 2006) .
There are a number of ongoing activities around the world to
study various aspects of climate–chemistry interactions, in the
troposphere and stratosphere. The international Aerosol model
inter-Comparison (AeroCom), the ACCENT model inter-comparison,
the assessment of the atmospheric impact of the transport sector in
the EU funded project ATTICA and the Task Force on Hemispheric
Transport of Atmospheric Pollutants (TF HTAP) focus on climate
relevant modeling studies. Under AeroCom, global tropospheric
aerosol models were compared and tested against satellite, lidar,
and sun photometer measurements. The ACCENT-MIP effort
previously focused on coordinating and comparing IPCC scenarios
(Nakicenovic et al., 2000 ), contrasting the climate in 2030 vs. 2000
across a suite of tropospheric chemistry–climate models, with
a goal towards capturing how climate change might affect air
quality (gas species only). This effort is extended to encompass the
activities of the TF HTAP. The activities focus on understanding and
quantifying northern hemispheric transport of gaseous and
particulate air pollutants and their precursors from source to
receptor regions.
A major new international effort towards analyzing climate–
chemistry models is being coordinated, called the Atmospheric
Chemistry and Climate (AC&C) Initiative. The focus of AC&C is on
identifying science issues, providing analysis tools, coordinating
and integrating activities, and furthermore to provide input on
climate–chemistry interactions to the IPCC process.
8.3.2. Other issues in improved modeling
of chemistry–climate interactions
As noted already, advancing the quantiﬁcation of climate–
chemistry interactions will also require improvement in the
fundamental building blocks of our understanding of tropospheric
and stratospheric chemical and physical processes. These include
improvements in characterizing the rates of gas phase, heteroge-
neous, and photolytic processes; process studies in the atmosphere
to test our understanding of the chemical processes; and incorpo-
ration of these processes in a realistic way in global climate–
chemistry models.
Long-term monitoring and observation is a prerequisite to
better understand and quantify the key atmospheric processes
affecting climate–chemistry interactions. These observations are
also a key to determining the scientiﬁc basis for understanding
how and why changes are occurring. Although signiﬁcant

studies have been made available during the last decade, in
particular satellite observations, the actual needs for observing
the Earth’s system are expanding and require more complex
experiments covering a wide range of instruments and observed
species on a global spatial and temporal scale. The value of an
integrated global observing system is worldwide recognized as
the only way to produce systematic, coherent data, capable of
addressing climate related issues on a global scale. The different
platforms used for data collection play complementary roles in the
establishment of long-term monitoring capability of global
coverage for process and global changes studies, and remain
essential to constrain models and predict the future of our planet
with reduced uncertainties.
9. Summary and conclusions
Potentially signiﬁcant contributions to the climate impact are
provided by compounds like CO 2,C H 4,O3, particles and cirrus
clouds. For the chemically active gases processes in the atmosphere
are important, with large spatial and temporal variations. Theclimate–chemistry interactions are therefore characterized by
signiﬁcant regional differences with regions as Southeast Asia
being a future key region due to signiﬁcant increases in energy
use, and pollution emission ( Akimoto, 2003 ;Kupiainen and Kli-
mont, 2007; Amann et al., 2008; Klimont et al., 2009; Isaksen et al.,
2009 ). Likewise, ship and air trafﬁc represent important sectors
because of signiﬁcant increases in emissions in recent years ( Eyring
et al., 2005a,b, 2007a; Dalsøren et al., 2009a; Lee et al., 2009 ). The
relative contributions to the emissions from various sectors are
expected to change signiﬁcantly over the next few decades due to
differences in mitigation options and costs.
Our ability to predict the extensive interaction between climate
and chemistry has improved signiﬁcantly over the last decade due
to an extensive increase in observational data and computer
resources, which has led to improved large-scale modeling capa-
bility for tropospheric distribution and trends. Both CTMs and
CCMs are available ( Eyring et al., 2005a,b; Bousquet et al., 2006;
Gauss et al., 2006; Stevenson et al., 2006 ) with more extensive
chemical processes included and higher resolutions, and with
observations available for model evaluation and long-term model
analysis, in particular satellite observations ( Gerasopoulos et al.,
2005; Richter et al., 2005; Laj et al., 2009 ). Extensive multi-model
comparisons and studies of emission impact have been performed
in projects like ACCENT, AEROCOM, and QUANTIFY during the last
few years. This demonstrates our ability to model man made
impact on atmospheric composition of chemically active climate
compounds ( Shindell et al., 2006; Stevenson et al., 2006; Textor
et al., 2006, Textor et al., 2007; Hoor et al., 2009 ;Fiore et al., 2009 ).
These model comparisons show, however, that there are signiﬁcant
model to model differences.
New satellite observations have provided data on the global
distribution of tropospheric column burden of ozone and methane,
as well as a number of ozone precursors (NO
2, CO, and HCHO) ( Laj
et al., 2009 ). Over the last two decades tropospheric ozone trends
from surface observations give a mixed signal depending on
regional trends in emissions of ozone precursors and possibly an
inﬂuence of a reversed trend in the inﬂux of stratospheric ozone
(Ordo´n˜ez et al., 2007 ).Shindell et al. (2006) report that a signiﬁcant
fraction of the increase in tropospheric ozone since preindustrial
time may have been reduced due to stratospheric ozone depletion.
Referring to changes since the 1970s Ordo´n˜ez et al. (2007) came to
the same conclusion. Models driven by changes in emissions are
capable of capturing some but not all of the features of the observed
trends in tropospheric ozone. A key point here is the difference inemissions from different emission sectors, and a number of studies
have focused speciﬁcally on attributing changes in atmospheric
concentrations to speciﬁc emission sectors. For instance, it is
possible that the large increase in emissions during the last decade
(Eyring et al., in preparation; Dalsøren et al., 2009a ), from ocean
going ship, may have led to increases in observed ozone at costal
stations in Europe and the western US.
OH is the key compound in the tropospheric oxidation process
(Monks et al., 2009 ). Long-term trend in global OH is signiﬁcant for
methane trend. Observations show that methane concentrations
leveled off during the last decade, although there was a signiﬁcant
increase between 2007 and 2008. It is debated if the leveling off in
methane is primarily caused by a leveling off in the emissions or if
the primary cause is an increase in global OH levels, possibly caused
by an increase in the NO/CO ratio in global emissions ( Dalsøren and
Isaksen, 2006 ). Although there is a general understanding of the OH
distribution, there are signiﬁcant uncertainties connected to OH
trends and to processes affecting distribution and trends ( Cariolle
et al., 2008 ). NO xemissions from ship trafﬁc represent a particularly
important source for atmospheric OH ( Eyring et al., in preparation ;
Hoor et al., 2009 ;Dalsøren et al., 2009a ). Surface emissions of NO x
in pristine areas from ship efﬁciently increase OH, thereby reducing
methane lifetime and atmospheric methane. It has been shown
that the efﬁcient methane reduction together with aerosol emis-
sions give a negative radiative forcing for current ship trafﬁc. Future
long-term impact will depend on mitigation measures adopted to
reduce emissions (reduction of sulfur and NO xemissions).
For aerosols a number of satellite retrievals of bulk aerosol
properties backed up by surface measurements and in-situ
campaigns have improved the understanding of the global distri-
bution of aerosols signiﬁcantly. Extensive model validation and
inter-comparisons within the AEROCOM project have revealed
signiﬁcant inter-model differences and discrepancies compared to
observations. Differences are mainly originating from differences in
model constructions ( Textor et al., 2006; Schulz et al., 2006; Textor
et al., 2007 ). Anthropogenic aerosols’ ability to alter the radiative
budget has been singled out as the most uncertain contributor to
the total anthropogenic forcing of the Earth-atmosphere system
(Forster et al., 2007 ). Several recent studies improve our under-
standing of the RF from different climate compounds. In a new
study, combining models and satellite data, Myhre (2009) esti-
mates the RF due to the direct effect of aerosols to be around
/C00.3 W m/C02, with halved uncertainty range compared to the
estimates by IPCC ( Forster et al., 2007 ).
Although the cloud albedo effect has been studied extensively for
several decades, it is still characterized by a low level of under-
standing. A number of studies on aerosol indirect effects have been
published since IPCC AR4, showing that the scientiﬁc community is
currently making an effort to increase the knowledge and reduce
uncertainties associated with aerosol indirect effects. Continued use
of satellite data combined with models, and continuous improve-
ments of cloud parameterizations, may reduce the uncertainties in
model estimates ( Anderson et al., 2003 ) of the aerosol indirect effect.
The comparison of the spread in estimates of indirect aerosol effects
inFig. 29 shows that the uncertainties have not decreased with time.
In fact, estimates span a larger range than ever, much due to the new
aerosol indirect effects recently taken into account.
A number of climate processes that inﬂuence the levels of
methane, tropospheric ozone and the oxidation capacity have been
identiﬁed through recent studies and to some extent quantiﬁed
through sensitivity experiments in models. These processes include:
Change in OH from temperature and humidity perturbations,
change in tropospheric ozone through STE exchange and changes in
stratospheric ozone; enhancements in methane emissions from
melting permafrost, changes in NO xemissions from lightning, andI.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5182change in biogenic VOC and NO xemissions from changes in surface
characteristics (humidity, temperature) ( Zeng and Pyle, 2003;
Collins et al., 2003; Isaksen et al., 2005 ;Horowitz et al., 2007 ;Sitch
et al., 2007; Walter et al., 2006a,b; Wu et al., 2008b ).
Models have been used for sensitivity studies and for studies of
changes in tropospheric and surface ozone for 2030, 2050 and 2100
due to both emission changes and climate change ( Prather et al.,
2003; Stevenson et al., 2006; Royal Society, 2008 ). Differences in
assumptions about improvements in control of precursor emissions
have signiﬁcant impacts on future tropospheric ozone concentra-
tions over the 30-year period from 2000 to 2030. An increase
between 10 and 14 ppb in annual zonal-mean ozone at 30/C14Ni s
calculated for the unregulated SRES A2 case, and a decrease of up to
6 ppb for the B2 þMFR (Maximum feasible reduction) case.
Changes in climate are found to slightly reduce the amount of
tropospheric ozone, through enhanced OH formation. Model
studies of OH concentrations in 2030 and 2050 indicate that global
OH concentrations will increase slightly due to emission changes,
but that this increase will be more than compensated by effects of
climate change. Higher temperatures give more water vapor and
enhanced OH production.
Changes in chemically active greenhouse gases and aerosols
have contributed signiﬁcantly to the overall radiative forcing since
pre-industrial times. Two considerations are important in for
estimates of future climate impact from man-made emissions: The
short chemical lifetime of most of the important chemically active
climate compounds as compared to CO 2, and the possibility for
mitigation options to reduce emissions. It is likely that in the future
the relative contribution from the chemically active climate
compounds become smaller compared to the contribution from
CO2. A consequence of the large differences in the lifetimes of the
climate compounds is that future effects are strongly dependent on
the scenarios adopted for emissions, and it is not obvious what type
of metric should be adopted ( Shine et al., 2005; Shine et al., 2007;
Berntsen and Fuglestvedt, 2008; Boucher and Reddy, 2008;
Fuglestvedt et al., in press ). Continued growth in emissions, for
instance, favors impact from the short-lived compounds.
Long-term monitoring and observation is a prerequisite to
better understand and quantify the key atmospheric processes
affecting climate–chemistry interactions. These observations are
also a key to building the scientiﬁc basis for understanding how and
why changes are occurring. Although signiﬁcant amounts of data
for large-scale model validation and process studies have been
made available during the last decade, in particular satellite
observations (see Laj et al., 2009 ), the actual needs for observing the
Earth’s system are expanding and require more complex experi-
ments covering a wide range of instruments and observed species
on a global spatial and temporal scale. A key question is the issue of
the natural variability of composition on different scales associated
with the climate variability, which indicate that longer, and
possibly ensemble simulations, may be required to extract the
signal of anthropogenic climate change on composition from that
related to natural climate variability.
