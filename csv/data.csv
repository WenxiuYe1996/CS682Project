Climate Informatics: Accelerating 
Discovering in Climate Science with Machine Learning
The goal of climate informatics, an emerging discipline, is to inspire collaboration between 
climate scientists and data scientists, in order to develop tools to analyze complex and ever-growing amounts of observed and simulated climate data, and thereby bridge the gap between data and understanding. Here, recent climate informatics work is discussed, along with some of the ﬁeld’s remaining challenges.
The impacts of present and potential 
future climate change pose impor-tant scientific and societal chal-lenges. Scientists have observed 
changes in temperature, sea ice, and sea level, and attributed those changes to human activity. It is an urgent international priority to improve our understanding of the climate system—a system characterized by complex phenomena that are difficult to observe and even more difficult to simulate. Despite the increasing availability of computational resources, cur-r e n t  a n a l y t i c a l  t o o l s  h a v e  b e e n  o u t p a c e d  b y  the ever-growing amounts of observed climate data from satellites, environmental sensors, and climate-model simulations. Computational ap-proaches will therefore be indispensable for these analysis challenges. The goal of the fledg-ling research discipline, climate informatics , is to inspire collaboration between climate scientists 
and data scientists (machine learning, statistics, and data mining researchers), and thus bridge the gap between data and understanding. Re-search on climate informatics will accelerate discovery and answer pressing questions in cli-mate science.
Machine learning is an active research area at 
the interface of computer science and statistics. The goal of machine learning research is to de-velop algorithms , automated techniques, to detect 
patterns in data. Such algorithms are critical to a range of technologies including Web search, rec-ommendation systems, personalized Internet ad-vertising, computer vision, and natural language processing. Machine learning also benefits the natural sciences, such as biology; the interdisci-plinary bioinformatics field has facilitated many discoveries in genomics and proteomics. The im-pact of machine learning on climate science has the potential to be similarly profound.
Here, we focus specifically on challenges in 
climate modeling; however, there are myriad collaborations possible at the intersection of these two fields. Recent work reveals that col-laborations with climate scientists also generate interesting new problems for machine learning.

Climate Modeling
Climate scientists use climate models, large-scale 
mathematical models run as computer simula-tions, to understand and predict the climate. Geophysical experts, including climate scientists and meteorologists, encode data from observed processes into highly complex, nonlinear math-ematical models. As shown in Figure 1, each gen-eral circulation model (GCM) includes numerous individual climate-process models, such as cloud formation, rainfall, wind, ocean currents, and radiative heat transfer through the atmosphere. Results emergent from the models, such as the sensitivity of the climate to increasing green-house gases, are crucial to researchers trying to project and forecast the Earth’s climate.
4 (It is im-
portant to note that whereas in machine learning, data mining, and statistics, the term model  typi-
cally means data-driven, in climate modeling this term refers to a system of mathematical models that are based on scientific first principles).
Global climate modeling efforts began in the 
1970s. The models have become more complex as computational resources have evolved. Cur-rently, about 25 laboratories across the world support almost 50 climate models, forming the basis of climate projections (predictions) as-sessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-mate Change (IPCC), which was established by the United Nations in 1988 and received the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize (shared with former Vice President Al Gore). Climate scientists ini-tially developed the Coupled Model Intercom-parison Project version 3 (CMIP3) archive to support the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.
5 
Researchers have used the archive in more than 500 publications, and it’s a rich source of cli-mate simulation output. The CMIP5 project continues the tradition of making global cli-mate-model predictions easier to use, and it will be quite significant in future IPCC reports.
The multi-model ensemble  (MME), the en-
semble of climate models that informs the IPCC, has high variance over model predic-
tions, for a variety of reasons. Different teams of scientists designed each model based on scientific first principles, which led to differ-ences in scope, discretization assumptions, the included science, and coding errors. Even though the different models’ predictions vary greatly, some climate scientists observed that overall, the average prediction (over multiple quantities, performance metrics, and time pe-riods) is more consistent than any one model.
6,7 
There has been growing interest, in the cli-mate-modeling community, in better ways to combine MME predictions, as well as methods to assess the “skill” of a single climate model (quantifying the model’s accuracy over a naive prediction). Researchers attempting to rank or weight models must show that the choices are meaningful for the specific context. One ap-proach supported by the climate science com-munity is the perfect model  assumption. In this 
framework, researchers assume one model to be the “truth,” then, over a calibration interval, they evaluate prediction methods trained on simulated observations generated by the “true” model. Scientists discussed these issues at an IPCC Expert Meeting on Assessing and Com-bining Multi-Model Climate Projections.

Our research applies machine learning al-
gorithms to the problem of tracking the multi-model ensemble.
1,3,9 Our results on tem-
perature data (observed and predicted tempera-ture anomalies averaged over global, regional, annual, and monthly scales) show that our algo-rithm produces predictions that nearly match, and sometimes surpass, the results of the best model for the entire observation sequence. This is significant, because only in hindsight can one determine the best model for the whole obser-vation sequence. We used online learning algo-rithms with the goal of making both real-time and future predictions. Moreover, our research shows that the naive “batch” approach has dis-advantages due to
 the nonstationary nature of 
the observations and the relatively short history of model prediction data.
Climate scientists use temperature anoma-
lies to express both the climate-model predic-tions and the true observations. A temperature anomaly is the difference between the observed temperature and the temperature at the same location at a fixed, benchmark time. To put it another way, anomalies are measurements of temperature change. Climate scientists use temperature anomalies because, while tem-peratures vary widely over geographical loca-tion, temperature anomalies typically vary less. For example, in a particular month it might be 80°F in New York, and 70 °F in Toronto, but 
the anomaly from the benchmark time might be 1°F in both places. Thus, variance is lower 
when researchers average temperature anoma-lies over many geographic locations, than when they use absolute temperatures. Figure 2 shows climate model simulation runs, and observation data, averaged over many geographical loca-tions, and many times in a year, yielding one value for a global mean temperature anomaly per year. In this case, researchers baselined the benchmark over the period 1951–1980 (one can convert between benchmark eras by subtract-ing a constant). The figure shows the climate model predictions we used as input to our glob-al annual experiments, where the thick red line is the mean prediction over all models, in both plots. The thick blue line indicates the true observations.
We obtained our results on Tracking  Climate 
Models (TCM)
1 by applying the Learn- a 
 algorithm,10 which tracks a shifting sequence 
of temperature values with respect to “expert” predictions, which we used to represent the  climate models.
1 In our previous work,10 bring-
ing a view from probabilistic graphical models to bear on traditional algorithms for  “online learning with expert advice,”
11,12 we re-derived 
such algorithms as Bayesian updates of a Hid-den  Markov Model (HMM), in which the 
identity of the current best expert is the hidden variable. This allowed us to introduce an algo-rithm that learns the switching rate between 
best experts, while simultaneously performing the original prediction task.
10 When we apply 
the Learn- a algorithm to the climate-model 
setting, the algorithm learns hierarchically, based on a set of generalized HMMs, where the hidden variable is the current best climate model’s identity.
We ran experiments on NASA’s histori-
cal temperature data (http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp), averaged annually and globally, from 1900 through 2009, as well as the cor-responding predictions of 20 different climate models per year (from the CMIP3 archive at www- pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/about_ipcc.php). 
These model simulations started from an ap-proximately stable climate in the 19th centu-ry, and were stepped forward using estimates of changes in the external drivers of climate change (greenhouse gases, volcanoes, atmo-spheric particulates, land-use changes, and so on). However, the model dynamics self-gen-erate the month-to-month and year-to-year variability. The GCM output wasn’t informed by observations, therefore it’s valid to run his-torical experiments using the GCM ensemble p r e d i c t i v e l y  o n  h i s t o r i c a l  d a t a .  W e  a l s o  r a n  experiments using climate model predictions through the year 2098, in order to harness the climate models’ future predictions. Of course, there’s no observation data in the future with which we could evaluate the machine learning algorithms. So, to achieve this goal, we ran fu-ture simulations using the scientific communi-ty’s “perfect model” assumption; we fixed one climate model, then used its predictions as the quantity to learn based only on the remaining 19 climate models’ predictions (and repeated this process 10 times). 
We also ran experiments at higher spatial 
and temporal granularity. We used hind-casts of the IPCC global climate models and the analogous true observations, over spe-cific geographical regions corresponding to several continents, at monthly and annual time scales. The predicted quantity was still a temperature anomaly. However, the data SEPTEMBER /OCTOBER  2013   35was averaged over a smaller geographical re-
gion than the whole globe; in particular, we ran experiments for latitude-longitude boxes corresponding to  Africa, Europe, and North 
Am e r i c a .  In  a d d i ti o n  t o  a nn u a l  e xp e r i m e n t s ,  we also ran experiments using monthly aver-a g e s  i n  e a c h  o f  th e  r e gi o n s .  N AS A  p r o vi d e d  observed data (http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gis-temp) and the  Koninklijk Nederlands Meteo-
rologisch Instituut (KNMI) Climate Explorer (http://climexp.knmi.nl) provided the model- prediction data. Both model and observation d a t a  s p a n n e d  f r o m  J a n u a r y  1 9 0 0  t h r o u g h

In every experiment we ran, Learn- a had a

the best climate model’s performance in all but two experiments (historical global  annual Figure 2. Global mean temperature anomalies. (a) Climate model predictions through 2098, with observations

Learn- a nearly matched the performance of 
the best climate model. Similarly, Learn- a 
surpassed (batch) least-squares linear regres-sion in all but two experiments (a global an-nual future simulation and a monthly future simulation for North America) and, again, its performance was still close. Learn- a’s outper-
formance of batch linear regression on almost all experiments suggests that the data’s non-stationary nature, coupled with the limited amount of historical data, poses challenges to a naive batch algorithm. Further experiments with a variety of different batch-learning algo-rithms would test this hypothesis (we recently achieved encouraging results using sparse matrix completion, an unsupervised batch technique).

The plots in Figure 3 show squared  error 
between predictions and (simulated) observa-tions, from 1900–2098, on a future simulation using global annual temperature anomalies. We plot Learn- a’s learning curve against the 
best and worst climate models’ performance (from the remaining ensemble, computed in hindsight), and the performance of the aver-age prediction over the ensemble of remaining climate models. Learn- a successfully predicts 
one climate model’s predictions up to the year 2098, which is notable, because future predic-tions vary widely among the climate models. We ran 10 future simulations with global an-nual temperature anomalies, each with a dif-ferent climate model providing the simulated observations. In each simulation, Learn- a suf-
fers less prediction error than the mean over the remaining models’ predictions, on 75–90 percent of the years. Figure 2 shows a marked fan-out among the model predictions that in-creases into the future. Over time, the model predictions’ mean performance diverges from most individual model trajectories. In the his-torical global annual experiment, Learn- a  
suffers less prediction error than the model  predictions’ mean for more than 75 percent of 
the years.
Geospatially Tracking Climate Models
Previous work provided techniques to combine the predictions of the multi-model  ensemble, 
at various geographic scales, by considering each geospatial region as an independent prob-lem.
1,7 However, climate patterns across the 
globe often vary significantly and  concurrently, 
so  assuming that each geospatial region is  independent could limit the performance 
of these previous approaches. We therefore  extended our work on the TCM  algorithm 
as follows:
1
rWe used a richer modeling framework that ac-
counts for GCM predictions at higher geospa-tial resolutions.
rUsing a nonhomogeneous HMM, we modeled 
the neighborhood influence among geospatial regions.
rWe ran experiments to validate these exten-
sions’ effectiveness.
We proposed a new algorithm: Neighbor-
hood-augmented Tracking Climate Models (NTCM).
3 This algorithm extends the TCM 
algorithm to operate in a setting where the GCM’s predictions are assessed at a higher spa-tial resolution. NTCM takes into account re-gional neighborhood influences when it forms predictions. The NTCM algorithm is fully de-scribed elsewhere,
3 and differs from TCM in 
two main ways:
rWe modified the Learn- a algorithm to include 
influence from a geospatial region’s neighbors in how the algorithm updates the weights over experts (the multi-model ensemble of GCMs’ predictions in that geospatial region).
rOur master algorithm runs multiple instances 
of this modified Learn-
a algorithm simulta-
neously, each on a different geospatial region, and uses their predictions to make a combined global prediction.
We modified the time-homogeneous HMM 
that generates the TCM algorithm1,10 in or-
der to model the neighborhood influence.3 
We instead use dynamically updated (nonho-mogeneous) transition dynamics (the proba-bilistic model of how the best climate model’s identity changes over time). These dynamics depend on a geospatial neighborhood scheme: the set of nearby regions that influence the re-gion in question. Researchers can use a variety of shapes and sizes to define the neighbor-hood scheme.
We first used a simple neighborhood scheme 
in which the four immediately adjacent re-gions (north, south, east, and west) are the geographical region’s possible neighbors.
3 We 
ran experiments with our algorithm on his-torical data,  using temperature observations and GCM  hindcasts. We  obtained historical SEPTEMBER /OCTOBER  2013   37climate model data from the CMIP3 archive 
(www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/about_ipcc.php) us-ing the Climate of the 20th Century Experi-ment (20C3M). Figure 4 compares the new algorithm’s performance over time: NTCM (indicated in red and blue) using 45-degree square regions, versus global Learn- a (as in 
the original TCM algorithm,
1 indicated in 
black) in a graph illustrating cumulative an-nual prediction error. This graph indicates that, for most years, and in particular for years later in the time-sequence, the NTCM algo-rithm’s cumulative global prediction  error was 
less than that of the global Learn- a  algorithm used in TCM, with NTCM’s b /g34 1 variant (full 
 neighborhood  influence)  obtaining lower pre-
diction error than that of the b /g34 0 variant (no 
neighborhood influence).
Challenge Problems for 
 Climate  Informatics
Climate scientists are working on many dif-
ferent kinds of problems for which machine learning, and other computer science expertise, could potentially have a big impact. Here, we provide a brief description of a few examples (with a discussion of related work in the lit-erature) that typify these ideas, although any Figure 3. (a) The squared error between predictions and (simulated) observations, from 1900–2098,

This shows the algorithm tracking the predictions of one climate model using the predictions of the remaining 19 as input, with no true temperature observations. The simulated observations are from the best-performing climate model from the whole ensemble (previously computed on historical data). The black vertical line separates past from future.

Improving Multi-Model Ensemble Predictions
As previously discussed, researchers have de-veloped and are improving multiple climate models; currently there are about 25 centers a c r o s s  t h e  g l o b e ,  m a n y  w i t h  m u l t i p l e  m o d -eling groups. Each model shares some basic features with some of the other models, but generally researchers design and indepen-dently implement unique models. In coor-dinated “Model Intercomparison Projects” (MIPs)—most usefully, the Coupled MIP (CMIP3, CMIP5), the Atmospheric Chemis-try and Climate MIP (ACCMIP), and the Pa-leoClimate MIP (PMIP3)—modeling groups  
attempt to perform analogous simulations with similar boundary conditions, but with multiple models. These multi-model ensem-bles offer the possibility to assess what features are robust across models. They also facilitate the study of the roles of internal variability, structural uncertainty, and scenario uncer-tainty in assessing predictions at different time and space scales. Finally, MIPs provide multiple opportunities for model- observation 
comparisons. Questions of  interest include 
the following:
rAre there “skill” metrics for present or past 
model simulations that are useful for future predictions?rAre there weighting strategies that maximize 
predictive skill? How would researchers explore this?
Weather and seasonal forecasts also raise these questions, but because of the long time scales involved in climate prediction, they’re more difficult for climate researchers to address.

Our research provides an example of how re-searchers can use the MME to predict climate change.

Parameterization Development
Clima te  m od e ls  n e e d  t o  be  a b l e  t o  m od e l  th e relevant physics at all scales, even those finer than any finite model can currently resolve. Ex-amples include cloud formation, turbulence in the ocean, land surface heterogeneity, ice floe interactions, and chemistry on dust particle surfaces, to name a few. Typically, scientists, using physical intuition and limited calibration data, dealt with these phenomena by using pa-rameterizations (physically coherent approxi-mations of the bulk effects) that attempted to capture the phenomenology of a specific pro-cess, and its sensitivity in terms of the (resolved) large scales. As observational data become more available, and direct numerical simulations of key processes become more tractable, the po-tential for machine learning and data mining techniques to help define and automate new pa-rameterizations and frameworks is increasing. For example, some researchers have used  neural 
network frameworks to develop atmospheric radiation models for use in GCMs.

Paleo Reconstructions
Understanding how climate varied in the past, before the onset of widespread instrumentation, is of great interest to climate scientists. The cli-mate changes seen in the Paleo record dwarf those in the 20th century, and hence could pro-vide insight into the significant changes we ex-pect this century. However, Paleo data are even sparser than instrumental data, and they aren’t usually directly commensurate with the in-strumental record. Paleo records (such as water isotopes, tree rings, pollen counts, and so on) could indicate climate change by proxy, but of-ten nonclimatic influences affect their behavior, and sometimes their relationships to more stan-dard variables (such as temperature or precipita-tion) are nonstationary or convolved. Scientists face an enormous challenge in bringing togeth-er disparate, multiproxy evidence to  discover Figure 4. Comparison of the Neighborhood-augmented Tracking 
Climate Models (NTCM) algorithm’s performance over time. The cumulative annual prediction error of NTCM is shown, using 45-degree square cells, compared to Learn- a’s prediction error.18901.6

Data Assimilation and Initialized  
Decadal Predictions
The main way in which sparse observational 
data is used to construct complete fields is through data assimilation .  T h i s  fi e l d  o f  r e -
search concerns how to update physics-based models with observed data, and includes such technology as the ensemble Kalman filter.
17 
Data assimilation is a staple of weather fore-casts, and the various re-analyses in the at-m o s p h e r e  a n d  o c e a n .  I n  m a n y  w a y s ,  t h i s  i s  the most sophisticated use of the combina-tion of models and observations, but its use in improving climate predictions is still in its infancy. For weather time scales, this works well. For longer-term forecasts (seasons to de-cades) the key variables are in the ocean, not the atmosphere; climate scientists have yet to fully develop a climate model initalization in which the evolution of ocean variability mod-els the real world in useful ways.
18,19 Climate 
scientists find the early results intriguing, if not convincing, and many more examples are slated to come online in the new CMIP5 archive.
20
Advances in data assimilation could also ben-
efit other areas of computer science. In robotics, for example, when a robot uses a physics-based model for the dynamics governing its move-ment, often it must also incorporate informa-tion gleaned from the onboard sensors, and, in some cases, additional real-time instructions from a human controller.
Developing and Understanding Perturbed 
Physics Ensembles (PPE)
The spread among different model predictions 
from different modeling groups is one way to measure the models’ “structural uncertainty.” However, we can’t consider these models a controlled random sample from the space of all plausible models. An approach that leads to a more accurately characterized  ensemble is 
to take a single model, and vary multiple ( un-certain) parameters within the code, generat-ing a family of similar models that nonetheless sample a good deal of the intrinsic uncertainty that arises when we choose any specific set of parameter values. Researchers have  successfully 
used these Perturbed Physics Ensembles (PPEs) in the Climateprediction.net and Quantifying 
 Uncertainty in Model Predictions (QUMP) 
projects to generate controlled model ensem-bles that they can systematically compare to observed data, and then make inferences.
21,22 
However, designing such experiments and ef-ficiently analyzing sometimes thousands of simulations is a challenge, but one which is in-creasingly going to be attempted.
We hope that this article encour-ages future work, not only on some of the challenge problems proposed here, but also on new 
problems in climate informatics. A huge and varied amount of climate data is available, pro-viding a rich and fertile playground for future machine learning and data mining research. Even exploratory data analysis could prove use-ful for accelerating discovery. There are count-less collaborations possible at this intersection of climate science and machine learning, data mining, and statistics. We strongly encourage future progress on a range of emerging prob-lems in climate informatics.

6. Conclusions
References7. Next Steps 8. Join us!•Methodology : We examine C3MP results to see if 
average climate conditions really produce the highest 
yields with reductions in the most extreme years (as 
determined by ranking the 1980 -2009 seasons 
according to rainfall and temperature ).
Rainfed Maize Response to Extremes (Fig. 6a)
•Maize models simulate lower yields for hotter and 
wetter conditions, but cool and wet extremes are the 
best years.  This may come from maize generally being 
grown in areas where frost during the growing season 
does not occur, or from shortcomings in model 
simulation of frost and water logging damages.
Rainfed Rice Response to Extremes (Fig. 6c)
•Most C3MP rice results use paddy management, so 
higher rainfall can be problematic due to leaching of 
nitrogen.  Dry extremes do not seem damaging.  Cool 
conditions are not much different than average, but 
warm extremes can have a large impact.
Rainfed Peanut Response to Extremes 
(Fig. 6d)
•Peanut models show a strong response to 
precipitation, with dry and warm conditions leading to 
the lowest yields.  Extremely wet seasons are 
favorable despite known problems from pod rot when 
soil is saturated.
•Emulators derived from C3MP sensitivity tests offer a mechanism to quickly 
assess any new climate scenario, providing a number of climate impact 
metrics.  Figure 3 presents projected changes in growing season temperature 
and precipitation in Ames, Iowa, USA, from the corresponding grid -box in 29 
CMIP5 GCMs.  CO2 concentrations for future periods are determined by the 
time period and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP; Moss et al., 2010) 
as listed in Table 1.  These CTW changes provide the inputs for emulators such 
as Eqn. 1.
•While the sign of precipitation change is unclear in Ames, the overall warming 
trend is clear.  Projections show a general pattern where warmer models tend 
to also be drier, while relatively cooler models are wetter.  
•As some AgMIP activities are limited by computational power and resources 
to analyze the huge number of possible models and scenarios that are possible 
(across climate/crop/economic/emissions/adaptation options), the cool/wet, 
cool/dry, hot/wet, hot/dry, and middle regions of projected change provide a 
strong basis for sub -setting the larger CMIP5 GCM ensemble.  The number of 
GCMs in each region also can serve as a relative weight in understanding the 
probability of each GCM in the subset.
•Similar projections can also be made from regional climate models, statistical 
projections, and future iterations of CMIP.C3MP sensitivity tests are used to fit emulators capturing the core crop model 
response to a range of temperature changes (T= -1 to +8˚C), precipitation 
changes (P = -50 to +50%), and CO2concentrations ([CO2] = 330 to 900 ppm).  
•These emulators take the form:
Q(T,P,[CO2])= a + bT + cT2+ dP + eP2+ f [CO2] + g [CO2]2 
+ h [T*P] + i [T*CO2] + j [P*CO2] + k [T*P*CO2] (Eqn. 1 ),
and are similar to those used by Crimp et al. (2008), for example, but add cross 
terms that allow for climate factor interactions (Ruane et al., 2014) .  These 
emulators have demonstrated strong fidelity to the raw crop model sensitivity 
test simulations, as evidenced by correlations and RMSE ( McDermid et al., 2015).
•Crop model emulators may be visualized through impact response surfaces 
showing mean yield response as well as uncertainty across analyzed simulation 
sets (Figure 2).  Across 126 rainfed maize sites there is a clear detrimental 
response to warmer and drier conditions, with a minor benefit from elevated 
[CO2] (maize=C4).  This quantifies the straight -forward mean yield response to 
mean climate change that has been the focus of most impacts assessments.
•Uncertainties remain large, particularly in response to temperature increases 
(right side of Figure 2).  Uncertainty across sites can come from many sources, 
including: soils, cultivars, management, crop models, baseline climate 
conditions, and fertilizer.  These results underscore that crop response to 
climate is not universal (Bishop et al., 2015).The Coordinated Climate -Crop Modeling Project (C3MP; Ruane et al., 
2014) was developed as an initiative of the Agricultural Model 
Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP; Rosenzweig et al., 
2013) to mobilize the worldwide network of crop modeling experts for 
a distributed climate impact study.  Participants document their crop 
modeling sites and then run a set of 99 sensitivity tests using climate 
data from the 1980 -2010 period provided either by the AgMERRA 
climate product (Ruane et al., 2015) or local observations.  Tools and 
protocols on www.agmip.org/c3mp facilitate the simulations and 
submission of results .  To date 1138 simulation sets have been 
submitted, representing more than 50 countries, 20 crop models, and 
nearly 20 crop and pasture specie ( McDermid et al., 2015).  Additional 
results are still coming in, and the C3MP network has connected 
researchers around the world.  The C3MP protocols have also been 
adapted by AgMIP’s regional integrated assessments ( Antle et al., 
2015), Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (Elliott et al., 
2015), and AgMIP’s Livestock Modeling Team.

mean yields requires non -linearity in these responses, particularly if extremes have lower yields (on average).Figure 2 : Impacts response surfaces describing key cross -sections of emulated

AgMIP activities.Recognizing that climate change will affect agricultural systems both
through mean changes and through shifts inclimate variability and associated extreme events, wepresent preliminary
analyses ofclimate impacts from anetwork of1137 crop modeling sites contributed totheAgMIP Coordinated Climate -
Crop Modeling Project (C3MP).Ateach sitesensitivity tests were runaccording toacommon protocol, which enables the
fitting ofcrop model emulators across arange ofcarbon dioxide, temperature, and water (CTW) changes .C3MPcan
elucidate several aspects ofthese changes andquantify crop responses across awide diversity offarming systems .
Here wetest thehypothesis that climate change and variability interact inthree main ways .First ,mean climate
changes can affect yields across anentire time period .Second ,extreme events (when they dooccur) may bemore
sensitive toclimate changes than ayear with normal climate .Third ,mean climate changes can alter thelikelihood of
climate extremes, leading tomore frequent seasons with anomalies outside ofthe expected conditions forwhich
management was designed .Inthis way, shifts inclimate variability canresult inanincrease orreduction ofmean yield, as
extreme climate events tend tohave lower yield than years with normal climate .
C3MPmaize simulations across 126 farms reveal aclear indication and quantification (asresponse functions) of
mean climate impacts onmean yield andclearly show that mean climate changes willdirectly affect thevariability ofyield .
Yield reductions from increased climate variability arenotasclear ascrop models tend tobeless sensitive todangers on
thecool andwetextremes ofclimate variability, likely underestimating losses from water -logging, floods, andfrosts .
C3MP is strengthened by each additional participating scientist and contributed 
simulation set. We encourage crop modelers to test new sites with the C3MP sensitivity 
tests in order to gauge core model responses and contribute to the common archive of 
C3MP sites. 
•It is not too late to participate! We continue to accept results, although each published 
paper freezes its archive and therefore earlier submissions are likely to appear in more 
publications.
•Growth in the C3MP archive and network will increase the robustness of analyses and 
increase the potential for collaborations in the AgMIP community and beyond .
•There is currently a great amount of data in the C3MP archive and we are eager for 
more researchers to evaluate it.  We have developed several strong paper ideas, and are 
willing to share the analyses and initial outlines with interested researchers and 
students who may have more time to pursue these ideas all the way to publication.Results presented here are in preparation for submission to a journal later this year.  This 
study also suggests additional work to further understand the questions raised here:
•Historical analysis of interannual yield distributions, with particular emphasis on non -
linearities in temperature and precipitation response that may suggest anomalous years 
tend to have lower yields than the average year.  
•This research will also have implications for indicator insurance programs, which often 
target a better balance through management of this interannual yield distribution.
C3MP analyses are designed to enable rapid assessment of new climate scenarios in order 
to identify key sites that merit further study.  
We are therefore planning intercomparisons and/or assessments with the following:
•AgMIP’s Regional Integrated Assessment sites in Africa and South Asia
•Results from the AgMIP Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (which also plans to 
run C3MP -based tests on a global grid)
•C3MP response functions for integrated assessment models (IAMs) and economic models.
•Links to AgMIP’s Coordinated Global and Regional Assessment
•Results from the Coordinated Regional climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), which 
provides downscaled scenarios
•AgMIP crop model intercomparison team outputs and field trialsThe Coordinated Climate -Crop Modeling Project (C3MP) has produced a very interesting archive of 
1137 simulation sets from modeled farm systems around the world.  This provides an 
unprecedented look at climate sensitivity and uncertainties that stand in the way of a universal 
response function.  C3MP results can be used to investigate the various ways in which mean 
climate change interacts with climate variability and results in impacts on agriculture.  
Mean climate changes are the most studied factor in assessing impacts on agriculture, 
and C3MP results indicate a substantial sensitivity to changes in mean temperature, rainfall, and 
[CO2]. The 126 -member ensemble of maize simulation sets show a strong negative response to 
warming temperatures and drier conditions, with a benefit from elevated [CO2] that is fitting for a 
C4 crop.  Responses are non -linear and suggest that biophysical thresholds may increasingly 
come into play as the climate warms.  Similar findings for other crops are also being evaluated by 
Mavromatis et al. (in prep.).  
Warm and dry years are most sensitive to both the beneficial and detrimental impacts of 
climate change, as these are more readily pushed near the heat and water stress thresholds that 
reduce yields in the future.  In this sense climate change will be felt in the agricultural sector most 
acutely when heat waves and droughts occur on top of a changing baseline of warmer and drier 
conditions.  Preliminary evaluations also indicate that growing seasons with extreme climates 
have lower average yields than those that experience a typical growing season’s climate, 
suggesting that an increase in climate variability alone would be enough to reduce mean yields 
over an extended period of time.  Simulations likely underestimate this effect as damages from wet 
and cool conditions appear to be lower than expected.•Methodology : The C3MP emulator approach may also be applied to sensitivity test metrics beyond the 30 -year mean yield.  In the above plots we have first examined the 1980 -2009 climate data for 
each simulation set to identify the 3 years that are warmest, coolest, driest, and wettest.  These represent extreme years fr om the historical record.  As sensitivity tests were created by imposing mean 
changes on historical data, these same extremes exist in each sensitivity test, allowing us to track these extreme years’ yie ldsacross the entire CTW sensitivity space.  By fitting an emulator to each set 
of extreme years we are therefore able to create impacts response surfaces for different types of years, as shown in Figures 4 and 5.•Recent observations and modeling studies have suggested a link between climate 
change and an increase in variability in major agricultural regions (e.g., Francis and 
Vavrus , 2012).  Even beyond the effects of mean climate change and interactions between 
climate change and extreme event impacts on crop yields, the potential of climate change 
to affect mean yields simply by increasing climate variability is a different dimension of 
impact that we explore here.  As farmers weigh mean climate heavily in their selection of 
cultivars and management practices, anomalous years are hypothesized to produce 
lower yields and therefore more variable climate would reduce yields over a long period.

•Although somewhat subtle, results indicate that dry years tend to benefit more from increased CO2
concentrations than do the average year.  This is consistent with the experimentally -observed 
increase in water -use efficiency from improved stomatal gas exchanges in elevated [CO2] 
environments.  A similar benefit is seen in the warmest years’ response to increased CO2, as there is 
likely a strong correlation between hot and dry years and both heat waves and droughts increase 
evapotranspiration demand and resulting water stress.

•Figure 4 represents the response of extreme years at 126 rainfed maize simulation sets to 
mean changes in temperature and precipitation.  The full 30 -year response surface (center) is 
also shown for reference.  
•Results indicate that mean climate change will not affect all years equally, with years that 
tend to be warm and dry more dramatically affected by climate than the average year.  Cool 
and wet years tend to have a muted response to mean climate change.  Together, these 
responses indicate that climate changes toward warmer and drier conditions will reduce mean 
yield but also increase yield variability, with the most detrimental impacts occurring when 
future hot or dry extremes occur on top of a climate that is already trending in that direction.a)

Emissions of air pollutants and their precursors determine regional air quality and can alter
climate. Climate change can perturb the long-range transport, chemical processing, and localmeteorology that inﬂuence air pollution. We review the implications of projected changes in
methane (CH
4), ozone precursors (O 3), and aerosols for climate (expressed in terms of the
radiative forcing metric or changes in global surface temperature) and hemispheric-to-continental
scale air quality. Reducing the O 3precursor CH 4would slow near-term warming by decreasing
both CH 4and tropospheric O 3. Uncertainty remains as to the net climate forcing from
anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NO x) emissions, which increase tropospheric O 3(warming) but
also increase aerosols and decrease CH 4(both cooling). Anthropogenic emissions of carbon
monoxide (CO) and non-CH 4volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) warm by increasing both
O3and CH 4. Radiative impacts from secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are poorly understood.
Black carbon emission controls, by reducing the absorption of sunlight in the atmosphere and on
snow and ice, have the potential to slow near-term warming, but uncertainties in coincident
emissions of reﬂective (cooling) aerosols and poorly constrained cloud indirect eﬀects confound
robust estimates of net climate impacts. Reducing sulfate and nitrate aerosols would improve airquality and lessen interference with the hydrologic cycle, but lead to warming. A holistic and
balanced view is thus needed to assess how air pollution controls inﬂuence climate; a ﬁrst step

Modeling and observational analyses suggest a warming climate degrades air quality (increasingsurface O
3and particulate matter) in many populated regions, including during pollution
episodes. Prior Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios (SRES) allowed
unconstrained growth, whereas the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenariosassume uniformly an aggressive reduction, of air pollutant emissions. New estimates from the
current generation of chemistry–climate models with RCP emissions thus project improved air
quality over the next century relative to those using the IPCC SRES scenarios. These two sets ofprojections likely bracket possible futures. We ﬁnd that uncertainty in emission-driven changes in
air quality is generally greater than uncertainty in climate-driven changes. Conﬁdence in air
quality projections is limited by the reliability of anthropogenic emission trajectories and the
uncertainties in regional climate responses, feedbacks with the terrestrial biosphere, and oxidation
pathways aﬀecting O
3and SOA.
1. Introduction
Air pollutants and their precursors can force the climate
system by altering solar and terrestrial radiation budgets, and
their distributions are in turn highly dependent upon regionalclimate. We focus here on two major global air pollutants, ozone(O
3) and aerosols (referred to interchangeably with particulate
matter below) in the near-surface atmospheric boundary layer.Increases in surface O
3and particulate matter (with diameter
o2.5mm, hereafter PM 2.5) driven by human activities since the
pre-industrial have been blamed for 0.7 /C60.3 million annual
respiratory mortalities and 3.5 /C60.9 million annual cardio-
pulmonary mortalities, respectively.1When considering strategies
to abate air pollution and mitigate anthropogenic climate warming,
policymakers face tradeoﬀs2and synergies.3For example, sulfate
is a major component of PM 2.5pollution in many regions, but
reducing sulfate for health reasons could lead to a rapid rise insurface temperatures ( e.g., ref. 4 and 5), possibly at rates
threatening the survival of some ecosystems.
2In the absence of
emission changes, a warming climate may degrade air quality inmany polluted regions,
6,7an impact that has been referred to as
‘‘a climate change penalty’’ on air quality.8We review the current
understanding of the interactions between air pollutants andclimate, aiming to identify robust conclusions that may guide
decision-making and to highlight critical knowledge gaps.
Any successful climate mitigation eﬀort must address
carbon dioxide (CO
2). The relatively short lifetimes of other
radiatively active air pollutants and their precursors (daysto weeks for O
3and aerosols, and approximately a decade
for methane) implies that changes in their atmosphericabundances could induce rapid climate responses in the nextfew decades.
9We thus refer to these species as ‘‘Near-Term
Climate Forcers’’ (NTCFs). Many studies reviewed here com-pare climate impacts of diﬀerent NTCFs by estimating radia-tive forcing (RF). RF is deﬁned by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the change in net radia-
tive ﬂux at the tropopause, after allowing stratospherictemperatures to adjust (note that other RF estimates allow
other fast time scale adjustments), induced by a change in
atmospheric abundance or distribution of a radiatively activespecies, typically expressed for present day relative to the pre-industrial.
10The equilibrium global mean surface temperature
response corresponds to the annual globally averaged RF afteraccounting for the climate sensitivity, which encompassesthe feedbacks in the climate system. Determining relative
climate impacts from diﬀerent species by comparing RFs
assumes that climate responses ( e.g., temperature, precipita-
tion, circulation changes) scale accordingly. This assumption
is not well-suited to the short-lived, heterogenous distributions
of air pollutants and their precursors (except for the well-
mixed greenhouse gas CH
4) which vary in their forcing
eﬃcacy.11,12A major advance in recent years is the incorpora-
tion of interactive chemistry into general circulation models
(GCMs), which allows for the direct examination of climate
responses to air pollutants and their precursors, and some
of the chemistry–climate interactions13in Table 1. Below, we
review this recent work as well as studies considering only RF
from air pollutants.
The interactions between air pollutants and climate are
often studied in the context of future emission scenarios. For
projecting the future evolution of air quality under climate
change, the most widely used emission trajectories to date are
those described in the Special Report on Emission Scenarios
(SRES).14A newly developed set of scenarios, the Represen-
tative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), is currently in use for
ongoing international, multi-model activities in support of the
upcoming IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The RCP
scenarios are described in detail and contrasted with the SRES
scenarios in several recent publications.15–22All RCPs assume
aggressive air pollution abatement measures (Fig. 1) and
correspondingly large decreases in PM and O 3precursors
globally.17,23Exceptions include ammonia (NH 3), which
increases in nearly all scenarios and CH 4, which ranges from
a 30% decrease to a more than doubling by 2100 (Fig. 1). We
emphasize that the assumption of aggressive air pollution
measures implemented globally is a major caveat in the
RCP-based projections, as the small range of possible air
pollutant emission trajectories across the RCPs may not
represent the true uncertainty in emission pathways.
In Section 2, we review the literature on climate responses to
emissions of air pollutants and their relevant precursors from
anthropogenic sources and the terrestrial biosphere. Section 3focuses on the processes by which changes in climate may
inﬂuence air quality. Section 4 reviews projections for air
quality over the next century, including changes driven by
climate and emissions under a suite of scenarios. We end in
Section 5 by discussing critical uncertainties and promising
new directions targeting these knowledge gaps.Downloaded by Columbia University on 15 October 2012

pollutant emissions
We review the literature describing climate responses to
changes in emissions of O 3precursors (Section 2.1), and
aerosols and their precursors (Section 2.2). Understandingthe climate responses to the particular mix of pollutant plusgreenhouse gas sources from individual anthropogenic emis-sion sectors (Section 2.3) is particularly relevant for policydecisions targeting controls on speciﬁc human activities.We brieﬂy highlight the potential for emissions from the
terrestrial biosphere to respond to changing pollution levelsand climate, and thereby further change air quality (Section 2.4).Biospheric feedbacks to climate have been addressed recently.
24
Throughout this section, we report RFs from pre-industrial to
present-day as reported in the literature. Individual studies
vary in their choice of base year for both pre-industrial andpresent-day but this is unlikely to be a major contribution tothe range of reported RFs.
2.1 Ozone (O
3) precursors
The increase in tropospheric O 3from pre-industrial to present-
day driven by human activities25has led to a positive climate
forcing (+0.35+0.3
/C00.1Wm/C02)10and substantial increases in O 3
RF are estimated for the next century with the SRES scenarios.26
Emissions of O 3precursors, particularly nitrogen oxides (NO x)
and volatile organic compounds (VOC) also produce secondaryaerosols and thereby a negative climate forcing, though thisaerosol RF is poorly quantiﬁed relative to the O
3RF.27We
discuss below the role of speciﬁc O 3precursor emissions, with a
strong emphasis on the role of CH 4,which has received growing
attention in recent years as a means to address jointly airpollution and climate goals.
3,28–30The dominant CH 4sink
occurs through oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (OH) in thetroposphere, which leads to a unique sensitivity of this green-
house gas to air pollutants and their precursors. Indirect RFs
from O
3precursors can occur viaprecursor-induced changes in
oxidant concentrations, which can a lter aerosol burdens; similarly,
changes in aerosol burdens may alter O 3concentrations.27,31,32
An additional, poorly quantiﬁed, indirect RF occurs whenhigh surface O
3concentrations damage vegetation and inter-
fere with the carbon and hydrologic cycles.33,34
Nitrogen oxides (NO x).As NO xlevels are suﬃciently
low in much of the troposphere, increases in anthropogenicNO
x(NO + NO 2) raise global average tropospheric O 3Table 1 Impacts of temperature-driven pathways on surface O 3and PM over land, adapted from Table 1 of Jacob and Winner7and Fig. 2 of

This positive forcing may be oﬀset by an accompanyingnegative forcing due to lower CH
4abundances, because
increasing NO xenhances tropospheric OH and reaction with
OH is the primary CH 4loss pathway in the atmosphere.36The
net RF of these opposing inﬂuences on the climate system
depends upon the emission location and season, with surface
anthropogenic NO xemissions generally leading to net cooling
but aircraft NO xaloft leading to small net warming.37–43
Consideration of gas–aerosol interactions suggests that globalincreases in NO
xemissions may exert a greater negative
forcing by enhancing sulfate burdens viaincreased oxidant
levels.44The aerosol response, however, is not robust across
models27and carbon cycle impacts from O 3exposure34may be
large enough to compensate for negative aerosol forcings.
Carbon monoxide (CO) and non-methane volatile organic
compounds (NMVOC). Increases in CO and in global anthro-
pogenic NMVOC lead unambiguously to additional positiveclimate forcing by raising both tropospheric O
3and CH 4
abundances through a reduction in OH.28,34,41,42,45,46Indivi-
dual anthropogenic NMVOC, however, can lead to secondaryorganic aerosol and an associated negative forcing.
47Gas–
aerosol interactions may augment this positive forcing bydecreasing sulfate burdens.
27,44Projected decreases in these
species under the RCPs17would thus help to mitigate climate
warming.
In contrast, the impact of biogenic VOC (BVOC) emissions
on climate is highly uncertain. BVOC include a broad suite ofcarbon compounds emitted naturally from vegetation, includ-ing isoprene (C
5H8), monoterpenes (C 10compounds), sesqui-
terpenes (C 15compounds), and a large number of oxygenated
VOC ( e.g., methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, and methylbutenol).
These emissions contribute approximately two-thirds of thenon-methane VOC budget at the regional and global scale
48
and the terpenoid compounds (isoprene and monoterpenes)are typically more reactive than many anthropogenic VOC.
49
BVOC oxidation can contribute to O 3formation when NO xis
present.50,51BVOC also alter global oxidant levels and thereby
impact CH 4abundances.52The magnitude and sign of the
net climate inﬂuence, however, is uncertain given incompleteknowledge of BVOC oxidation chemistry and corresponding OHchanges, particularly in low-NO
xregions of the atmosphere53,54
as discussed further in Section 5.
Methane (CH 4).Although not a direct air pollutant, CH 4
oxidation in the presence of NO xenhances global tropospheric
O3.35,55,56From pre-industrial to present, the RF from the
more-than-doubling of the atmospheric CH 4abundance is
estimated to be +0.48 /C60.05 W m/C02, second after CO 2in
terms of anthropogenic RF from greenhouse gases.10An
estimate of the net RF associated with the preindustrial-to-present growth in CH
4emissions includes the impact of CH 4
on tropospheric O 3, stratospheric water vapor, and aerosols.
From this ‘‘emission-based view’’, RF from CH 4almost doubles
from the abundance-based estimate to 0.8–1.0 W m/C02.44,45The
high end of the range includes the indirect inﬂuence of changesin oxidant chemistry on sulfate aerosol, where more CH
4leads
to less OH and correspondingly less cooling viasulfate aerosol.A multi-model study, however, suggests a smaller sensitivity
of aerosols to oxidant changes.27Furthermore, the net RF
due to increases in CH 4emissions since pre-industrial times
has been partially oﬀset by increases in NO xemissions (which
decrease CH 4by increasing global OH). Scenarios for the
21st century indicate a wide range of possible CH 4abundances
(Fig. 1; Nakicenovic et al.14) and numerous abatement oppor-
tunities could lessen future CH 4RF.29,57–59The recent
WMO/UNEP report30estimates a 0.2–0.4 K decrease by
2050 relative to a reference emission scenario if a deﬁned setof CH
4control technologies were implemented worldwide
by 2030, corresponding to a 24% decline in anthropogenicCH
4emissions relative to 2010 levels (Fig. 2; see also Shindell
et al.3).
Much uncertainty remains in our understanding of the
contributions from speciﬁc source sectors to CH 4emissions,60
the underlying factors contributing to recent observed trends(e.g., ref. 61–63), and in feedbacks from the biosphere.
13
Although these uncertainties limit conﬁdence in accurately
projecting the future evolution of CH 4, it is clear that decreasing
atmospheric CH 4would slow near-term warming, due to its
stronger climate impact on the 20 year ( versus 100 year) time
frame, which could help to slow Arctic sea ice loss overthe next few decades.
64Reducing CH 4would also decrease
tropospheric O 3, including the baseline O 3levels in surface
air, thereby lessening the adverse impacts on vegetation andhuman health.

2.2 Aerosols
Atmospheric aerosols impact climate in numerous ways ( e.g.,
Isaksen et al.13). Brieﬂy, aerosols scatter and absorb shortwave
Fig. 2 Observed temperature anomaly through 2009362and projected
temperature anomaly under various scenarios, all relative to the
1890–1910 mean. Results for future scenarios are the central values
from analytic equations estimating the response to forcings calculated
from composition–climate modeling and literature assessments
(see online material of Shindell et al.3). The rightmost bars give 2070
ranges, including uncertainty in radiative forcing and climate sensi-
tivity. A portion of the uncertainty is systematic, so statistically
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between scenarios may still occur even with
overlapping ranges (for example, if climate sensitivity is large, it is
large regardless of the scenario, so all temperatures would be toward
the high end of their ranges; see www.giss.nasa.gov/staﬀ/dshindell/
Sci2012). From Shindell et al.3(their Fig. 1). Reprinted with permis-

Aerosols can also alter the properties of clouds through
indirect eﬀects (by aﬀecting cloud microphysics),71the semi-direct
eﬀect (where aerosol absorption aﬀects temperature structure),72
and cloud absorption eﬀects (from absorbing aerosol inclusions
within or interstitially between hydrometeors).73When absorbing
aerosols ( i.e.BC and potentially dust) are deposited onto snow
and ice surfaces, they reduce surface albedo, which ampliﬁes thepositive RF. In addition, deposition of aerosols and theirdissolved nutrients to the biosphere (land and ocean) maymodify biogeochemical processes causing further changes toclimate.
74It is unlikely that these eﬀects add linearly.
Anthropogenic aerosol. Anthropogenic aerosol consists
mainly of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon (BC)
and organic carbon (OC). These aerosol components interact
with radiation in diﬀerent ways depending on size and com-position and contribute either a cooling or a warming forcingon climate. The AR4 IPCC report
10estimated that the net
aerosol direct forcing from all anthropogenic components islikely to be a cooling with a best estimate of /C00.5/C60.4 W m
/C02.
Myhre et al.75used a combination of models and satellite
observations to estimate the direct RF at /C00.35 W m/C02whereas
Bellouin et al.76used satellite observations to estimate
/C00.65 W m/C02. Myhre77report a best estimate for aerosol
direct RF of /C00.3 W m/C02after reconciling divergent estimates
from modeling and observational approaches by accounting
for diﬀerences in cloud-masked forcing and changes over thelast century in bulk aerosol optical properties. Sulfate, nitrateand OC aerosol scatter radiation with direct aerosol RFsestimated as /C00.4 W m
/C02,/C00.1 W m/C02and/C00.05 W m/C02
respectively.10BC absorbs solar and infrared radiation resulting
in a positive aerosol direct eﬀect that is estimated to be between+0.25 and +0.44 W m
/C02in model studies78but potentially as
large as +0.9 W m/C02when constrained by observations.79,80
A multi-model assessment by Koch et al.81shows that global
models underestimate observed aerosol absorption optical
depth (AAOD); scaling model AAOD to match observations
resulted in BC multi-model average direct eﬀect of +0.55 W m/C02.
The absorption eﬀect of BC in liquid cloud droplets may causean additional BC RF of +0.1 /C60.4 W m
/C02.82
The impact of anthropogenic aerosol on clouds is more
uncertain. The ﬁrst aerosol indirect eﬀect, also known as thecloud albedo eﬀect, was estimated by the IPCC AR4 to be/C00.7 W m
/C02(range /C00.3 to /C01.8 W m/C02).10Quaas et al.83used
satellite data to estimate a smaller cloud albedo eﬀect of/C00.2 W m
/C02, potentially suggesting that models may be over-
estimating the eﬀect. However, a more recent multi-modelestimate
84linked to satellite observations quantiﬁed the aerosol
indirect eﬀect as /C00.7/C60.45 W m/C02. Very little is known on the
contribution of diﬀerent aerosol components to the aerosolindirect eﬀect. While several studies have quantiﬁed the cloud
albedo radiative eﬀect of BC-containing particles,
82,85–89the
sign of the cloud forcing is model-dependent and varies withthe BC to OC mass ratio, the size of emitted particles, and themagnitude of the emission change.
Absorbing aerosols also impact climate after deposition to
bright surfaces. In particular, BC causes additional warmingof climate after deposition onto snow and ice surfaces byreducing the albedo of snow.
90Flanner et al.91estimate that
the snow-albedo forcing and associated feedbacks from allanthropogenic BC emissions result in global warming (annualmean temperature) of between 0.1 and 0.15 K, while Jacobson
92
ﬁnds that fossil and biofuel sources alone result in a warmingof between 0.03 and 0.11 K through this eﬀect.
The overall eﬀect of anthropogenic aerosol is likely to be a
cooling impact on climate. The IPCC AR4 estimated a totalforcing of /C01.2 W m
/C02from anthropogenic aerosol, partly
oﬀsetting the warming of 2.6 W m/C02from long-lived green-
house gases.10These estimates do not include aerosol-induced
changes to biogeochemical cycles, which were recently esti-mated to be /C00.5/C60.4 W m
/C02.74Uncertainty in the magni-
tude of the aerosol cooling leads to large uncertainties inprojections of future climate change ( e.g., ref. 93 and 94).
Removal of this cooling inﬂuence due to air pollution abate-ment policies is expected to enhance future warming.
95–98
The strong warming due to the direct eﬀect and snow-
albedo eﬀect of BC imply that BC emission reductions could
yield a short-term climate beneﬁt.99–105Models indicate that
the Arctic is particularly sensitive to BC forcing.91,101,106In
particular, Flanner et al.107ﬁnd that deposition of BC and OC
and the subsequent snow/ice albedo feedback induces 95% asmuch springtime snow cover loss over Eurasia as anthropo-genic carbon dioxide. The combustion sources that emit BC,also emit other aerosol components that tend to cool climate,principally OC, so the net climate impact of emission controlsis uncertain. Ramanathan and Carmichael
80suggest that
elimination of BC sources would reduce global surface tem-
peratures by 0.5 to 1 K. Shindell et al.3simulated the eﬀect of
implementing a range of air quality measures that control the
emissions of BC-containing particles and O 3precursor species
and estimate 0.19 K avoided warming by 2050. They foundthat reducing BC emissions resulted in greater reductions inwarming from the semi-direct eﬀect than reductions in coolingfrom the indirect eﬀect, although they note that the magnitudeof these diﬀerent eﬀects is model dependent. In contrast,Leibensperger et al.
108,109found little warming due to BC over
the US and suggested that BC emission controls in the US
have little climate mitigation potential. The large uncertainty
of the net impact of BC mitigation on surface temperaturesreﬂects uncertainty in co-emitted species as well as cloudfeedbacks.
86–88,110
Regional temperature responses to aerosol forcings have
been examined in a few studies. One study suggests thatreductions in sulfate emissions alongside increases in BCemissions have contributed to some of the recent warmingobserved in the Arctic.
111Leibensperger et al.109found that
direct RF from anthropogenic aerosol peaked in 1970–1990 at/C02Wm
/C02over the eastern US where it cooled annual mean
temperatures over the central and eastern United States by
0.5/C011C. By 2010, the forcing declined to /C01.2 W m/C02due
mainly to decreasing SO 2emissions. They further suggested
that U.S. anthropogenic aerosols are currently suﬃciently lowthat future air quality improvements projected to occur overthe period 2010–2050 will result in minimal warming (0.1 1C)
over the United States.

Aerosols may alter regional atmospheric circulation pat-
terns, ranging from shifts in the width of the tropics, Arctic
Oscillation phasing, monsoons, jet locations, and associated
precipitation.80,108,116–121Absorbing aerosols are possibly
more potent at altering circulation patterns than CO 2and
scattering aerosols.122–125Observed drying trends over Africa,
South Asia and northern China over the past decades havebeen partially attributed to anthropogenic aerosol forcing(e.g., ref, 80, 117, 126 and 127), suggesting that aerosol
decreases in these regions over the next century would reversethese trends. Precipitation responses to changes in aerosoloptical depth, anthropogenic aerosols, and speciﬁc fuel emis-sions sectors have been documented in several modeling
studies ( e.g.,ref. 5, 31 and 128). Some studies have noted that
the sign of the precipitation response to BC depends on theBC vertical distribution

strained in current models.81,130Shindell et al.131point out
that controlling anthropogenic aerosols should restore disruptedregional precipitation patterns and consideration of this addi-tional climate response may oﬀset some of the adverse eﬀectsof the temperature rise induced by removing anthropogenicaerosol.
Secondary organic aerosol (SOA). SOA arises from both
biogenic and anthropogenic sources, and continuously evolvesin the atmosphere as a function of multi-generational oxida-tion and dynamic gas-particle partitioning. Biogenic VOCoxidation can lead to the formation of SOA through a suiteof multi-phase reactions, as reviewed recently.
132,133SOA
likely contributes a substantial fraction of total organicaerosol
134but the impact of SOA on the radiative balance of
the atmosphere is poorly understood ( e.g., ref. 135). Some
global models neglect SOA formation from anthropogenic
precursor emissions,78which would lead to an underestimate
of RF from SOA.
Furthermore, formation of biogenic SOA can be enhanced
in the presence of anthropogenic organics and particulatematter, where the anthropogenic species provides greater sur-face area for condensation and enables additional chemical
interactions.
136–139As recently reviewed,140the formation
mechanisms of SOA can be aﬀected by interactions withanthropogenic pollution in multiple ways, including (1) thepartitioning processes to transfer gas-phase biogenic VOC tothe particulate phase, (2) the role of NO
xthrough nitrate-
initiated reactions or changing yields depending on NO x
conditions (with changes depending on the speciﬁc biogenic
VOC), and (3) the contribution of biogenic VOC nucleation tothe formation of new particles in the atmosphere. Recent
studies estimate that approximately 20–50% of SOA could
result from anthropogenic activity.
140–145Anthropogenic
enhancement of SOA implies an additional aerosol forcingbeyond that reported in the IPCC AR4. Both Hoyle et al.
137
and Myhre et al.75report that increases in the SOA burden
from pre-industrial to present day have resulted in a direct RFof nearly /C00.1 W m
/C02. Spracklen et al.88estimate that if asubstantial fraction of global SOA burden is from anthropo-
genic activity, the aerosol direct forcing is larger ( /C00.26/C6
0.15 W m/C02), and they further estimate a cloud albedo eﬀect of
/C00.6 W m/C02. O’Donnell et al.47use simulations with and
without SOA for year 2000 meteorological conditions toestimate an overall climate impact of /C00.09 W m
/C02, which
includes opposing inﬂue nces from the direct eﬀect ( /C00.31 W m/C02)
and indirect eﬀect (+0.23 W m/C02). In their simulations,
particle growth from SOA condensation combined with alarger coagulation sink for small particles leads to a warmingindirect eﬀect from SOA. Further work is needed to reconcilethe sign of the SOA inﬂuence on the cloud albedo feedback.
2.3 Anthropogenic emission sectors
In contrast to long-lived greenhouse gases, the climate impact
of NTCFs can depend on emission location and chemicalinteractions with co-emitted species, which can vary stronglyby emission sector. Determining the net climate impact of thesuite of emissions from an anthropogenic activity requiresexplicit three-dimensional model calculations that considerinteractions and nonlinearities between the co-emittedchemical species, which may have oﬀsetting or additive climateimpacts. Global chemistry–climate models are often employedto determine the sectoral RF impacts of the NTCFs but fewstudies extend to estimate the more computationally expensive
climate response ( e.g., ref. 5 and 98).
The transportation sub-sectors have received the greatest
attention.
40,146–156The net climate impacts of biomass
burning,157,158electric power production,159,160household fuel
burning,161and regional sector impacts156,161–164have also
been assessed. Newer studies consider climate impacts acrossboth long-lived greenhouse gases and NTCF gas and aerosolcomponents including aerosol–cloud interactions.
148,165In
terms of net RF, which has been estimated for several sectorsacross diﬀerent modeling systems and emission inventories,road transportation is consistently the largest contributor to
warming on short to long timescales, aviation generally pro-
duces a small net warming, while shipping emissions yield net
cooling on century timescales.
166Overall climate impacts may
change in the future as various technology controls are appliedto diﬀerent sectors. Black carbon emissions from shippinghave been comprehensively reviewed
167and are of particular
concern in the Arctic because of the local climate sensitivity tosnow-ice albedo eﬀects following deposition.
156
In one study, full implementation of state-of-the art aerosol
control technologies in conjunction with increasing green-house gases led to an increase in global mean temperatureby 2.2 K in 2030 relative to today, nearly doubling the eﬀect of
greenhouse gases alone over this period.
98Maximum abate-
ment in the industry and power sectors (dominated by sulfateaerosol) yielded a somewhat lower response of 1.9 K; maximum
abatement in the domestic and transport sectors (dominated by
black carbon) still caused an increase of 1.4 K.
98
A limitation of the sector-based approach to date is that it
refers to a ﬁxed mix of emissions. The most desirable approachis to quantify the climate impact of speciﬁc policy-relevantenergy shifts or emission control policies. Progress has beenmade in this direction, for example investigating the trade oﬀDownloaded by Columbia University on 15 October 2012

tradeoﬀs with climate need further investigation.
2.4 Terrestrial biogeochemical – air pollution feedbacks
Climate impact assessments have largely neglected feedbacks
between air pollutants and biogeochemical cycles.74O3deposi-
tion on vegetation suppresses CO 2uptake by the land or
vegetation sink.175One study suggests the magnitudes of the
O3direct RF and the O 3indirect RF through CO 2are
comparable.33Aerosols reduce the total amount of radiation
reaching the surface but can enhance the diﬀuse component,which may penetrate deeper into a vegetation canopy dependingon the ecosystem type and the magnitude of aerosol loading.
176–178
It is feasible that anthropogenic aerosol may have furthersubstantial eﬀects on the CO
2land sink, by altering the surface
energy budget179–181and the amount of precipitation, thereby
inﬂuencing water stress in vegetation.182Atmospheric deposi-
tion of sulfate, nitrate and carbonaceous aerosol to surfaceecosystems may impact the carbon cycle but these feedbacksare highly uncertain.
Because terrestrial biogenic emissions are climatically driven,
multiple feedbacks can occur between climate, the emis-sions, and therefore air quality. For example, biogenic VOCemissions are dependent on radiation, temperature and soilmoisture.
48Atmosphere–biosphere feedbacks through bio-
genic aerosols have been proposed in the literature,183–185
but these are largely estimated by models as it is diﬃcult toquantify these feedbacks with observational studies. A quali-tative summary of several of these feedbacks is included inTable 1 where we provide an assessment of the level ofconﬁdence in the sign of the response to rising temperatures,along with the impacts of these climate-driven pathways onsurface O
3and PM. Finally, land-use changes have also been
shown to inﬂuence regional air quality by altering emissionsfrom the biosphere.
186–189
3. Air quality response to a warming climate
There are several pathways by which climate change mayinﬂuence O
3and PM air quality. Observational evidence
and model studies of these processes have been reviewedrecently
7,13and are summarized in Table 1. Brieﬂy, the
formation and accumulation of air pollutants is known to
correlate strongly with local meteorological variables ( e.g.,
temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and wind). Inmany cases, the underlying driver of these strong relationshipsis variability in synoptic conditions ( e.g., ref. 190 and 191). For
example, over the eastern United States and Europe, observa-tions demonstrate that extreme air pollution (O
3and PM 2.5)i s
typically associated with air stagnation events.190,192–198As
described below, both modeling and observational analysessuggest an exacerbation of air pollution in a warmer climate,including extreme episodes, at least in some populated regions.We note that some regions may be particularly sensitive to
large feedbacks from natural O
3and aerosol sources, such as
wildﬁres, dust, and biogenic precursors and from changes inchemical and depositional sinks.
199–205For example, Southern
Europe may be particularly sensitive to climate change due tovegetative feedbacks including increased biogenic VOC emis-
sions and decreased dry deposition when heat leads to closure
of plant stomata.
206
To understand the processes by which O 3and PM in surface
air are inﬂuenced by changes in climate, several approachesare used (as reviewed by Jacob and Winner
7):
(1) Sensitivity studies in which individual meteorological
parameters are perturbed ( e.g., ref. 207 and 208);
(2) Statistical downscaling of future changes in meteoro-
logical ﬁelds, using correlations between observed changes inair quality indices and meteorological variables from climatemodels ( e.g., ref. 209–211); and
(3) The direct calculation of air quality by various global
and regional modeling approaches that include:
(i) Fully coupled global chemistry–climate models (CCMs;
Table S1, ESI z).
(ii) Fully coupled regional CCMs;
215–217
(iii) Global-to-urban CCMs ( e.g., ref. 218);
(iv) Oﬀ-line global or regional chemical transport models
(CTMs) forced using projections of meteorological ﬁelds fromseparate atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs)
(e.g., ref. 8) or dynamically downscaled meteorology ( e.g.,
ref. 219 and 220).
Approaches (1) and (2) provide valuable process-level
relationships that can be used to evaluate the present-climatesimulations in the modeling systems under Approach (3).Caution is needed when applying air pollution relationshipswith meteorological variables on small spatial scales to projectair quality responses to future climate change since the sensi-tivities of air pollution to individual meteorological variablesvary in space and time and are non-linear.
6,194,205,221–226
Statistical downscaling based on synoptic conditions mayprovide more accurate projections,
190,191,210,227though models
must credibly simulate changes in these synoptic conditions
and it is unclear if current statistical relationships are applic-
able to future climate conditions.
3.1 Ozone
In the case of surface O 3, it is well established that in many
polluted regions, high-O 3events correlate strongly with
temperature due to associations of temperature with stagnationepisodes, with enhanced photochemistry, and with biogenicand wildﬁre emissions.
5–8,186,195,200,221,223,228–232Table 1 sum-
marizes current understanding of potential impacts of a
warming climate on surface O 3and distinguishes between
baseline surface O 3levels (deﬁned as those not inﬂuenced
directly by local emissions233) and local-to-regional (LR)
responses. Baseline surface O 3is very likely to decrease in a
warmer climate because higher water vapor abundances willenhance O
3destruction in low-NO xregions of the atmosphere
and lead to shorter O 3lifetimes.234The increase in temperature
itself has little impact on O 3in these regions.228Climate-driven

3.236–238In some regions and seasons, higher
biogenic emissions from vegetation and soils and shifts intransport pathways for intercontinental pollutant transport
could oﬀset the decrease in baseline O
3associated with higher
atmospheric water vapor abundances.8,223,239On large
spatial scales, Doherty et al.232ﬁnd little response of inter-
continental transport pathways themselves to a warmingclimate, but note enhanced sensitivity of O
3to emissions
within the source region (reﬂecting isoprene increases andthermally driven decomposition of peroxy acetyl nitrate whichcould otherwise export NO
xdownwind) and decreased sensi-
tivity to intercontinental sources (mainly due to higher watervapor).
We synthesize the surface O
3response to climate change as
estimated by various modeling systems in Fig. 3 (blue bars and
symbols). A major caveat is that many studies use present-dayand climate simulations spanning only a few years each due tocomputational limitations. While these studies highlight the
responses of air quality to meteorological changes, the simula-tions are too short to distinguish a true anthropogenic-forcedclimate signal from internally generated climate variability (seealso Nolte et al.
223). The ranges in Fig. 3 reﬂect spatial
variability as well as diﬀerences across models, including in
simulation length, scenarios, and reported O 3statistics and
thus are not a good measure of the true uncertainty. Forexample, the multi-model annual, spatial averages withstandard deviations that bracket zero
240are the net sum of
opposing inﬂuences from a warming climate: lower baselineO
3levels but higher O 3in polluted regions and seasons.7,234
These results are plotted alongside several studies that reportspatial ranges for daytime statistics during the high-O
3season.
Fig. 3 shows that climate change-induced increases in surfaceO
3of up to 10 ppb have been estimated for populated regions
over the United States by 2050 and up to 6 ppb over Europe by
2030 during the high-O 3season. At the sub-continental scale,
models often disagree in terms of the sign and magnitude of
changes, such as for summer over the Midwest, Southeast and

the literature in 2030 (top) and 2050 (bottom) for selected world regions. Results from individual studies are labeled by letters underneath the
corresponding plot symbols. Solid vertical bars represent a combination of ranges as reported in the literature: (1) multi-model mean and standard
deviations in annual mean, spatial averages from the ACCENT/Photocomp study for 2030 (A240); (2) application of a parameterization developed
from the multi-model ensemble of the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (TF HTAP) regional source-receptor relationships to
estimate surface O 3response over the TF HTAP continental regions to emission changes (C66); (3) spatial averages across a region, denoted by
ﬁlled squares (E,186I,244K,242M,220Q,267T,58U,68W,28X,2872286); (4) spatial ranges across a region as estimated with one model or combined
across several individual modeling studies, denoted by dotted lines (B,278D,283F,224G,8H,239J,223K,242L,245P,286R,363S;246V,29Y,298
Z,3001281). Regional deﬁnitions, methods, and reported metrics ( e.g.,2 4h versus daily maximum values over a 1 hour or 8 hour averaging period,
annual or seasonal averages) vary across studies, but the O 3changes shown here are self-consistent. Climate change scenarios vary across studies,
but are combined into ranges denoted by blue bars because there is little detectable cross-scenario diﬀerence in the climate response, particularly in
2030, and many of these estimates are based on simulations that are too short to diﬀerentiate cleanly the climate change signal. Tables S2–S5 in the
ESIzcontain details on the plotted values.Downloaded by Columbia University on 15 October 2012

3.2 Particulate matter
Particulate matter is also inﬂuenced by many of the same
processes as O 3(Table 1), but additional complications include
opposing inﬂuences on the various PM components.7,194,241
Climate-driven changes in PM can be large, but they arehighly uncertain and model-dependent (Table 1).
7Aerosol
burdens are particularly sensitive to precipitation changesand are expected to decrease in regions with increasedprecipitation.
186,241–246Regional and seasonal changes in pre-
cipitation must be considered since global soluble aerosol
burdens do not typically scale with global precipitation
changes.98,247Changes in mixing depths and ventilation of
the continental boundary layer also contribute to the sign ofthe aerosol changes but are highly uncertain.
7,219,222,248
Large feedbacks are possible from ‘‘natural’’ aerosol sources
(Table 1), particularly carbonaceous aerosols from wildﬁres,mineral dust, and biogenic precursors to secondary organicaerosol.
202–204,229,249–253In regions experiencing warming and
drying, wildﬁres are expected to increase under climatechange.
254Dust events are known to aﬀect urban areas
seasonally, increasing hazardous levels of PM 2.5and reducing
visibility in regions downwind of major desert source regions,
and in some cases, leading to long-range transport acrossoceans.
255–258As with other types of particulate matter, dust
can provide a surface for heterogeneous reactions, leading toenhancement
259and uptake of pollutants which can alter the
optical properties and solubility of the primary emission.260,261
Although dust is mostly considered as ‘‘natural’’, the frac-tion of ‘‘anthropogenic’’ dust (such as from disturbed soilsor construction) is subject to debate with possible valuesranging from 5–7%
250to 60%,249with the latest estimate
around 25%.262Primary biogenic aerosols are emitted to the
atmosphere in the form of pollen, bacteria, spores, or plant
fragments,263–265though knowledge is limited as to their
contribution to PM 2.5concentrations or how they will change
with climate.5
Individual aerosol species respond diﬀerently to meteoro-
logical changes. Rising temperature and water vapor enhanceSO
2oxidation relative to surface loss, increasing sulfate
aerosol but decreasing nitrate aerosol.241,242,248,266–269One
study, however, shows that observed correlations of tem-perature and water vapor with sulfate, nitrate, and organiccarbon largely reﬂect their co-variation with synoptic trans-port rather than these direct impacts.
190While warmer
temperatures should reduce the partitioning of gas phase
secondary organics into the aerosol phase, e.g., ref. 202, they
may also increase the biogenic contribution to PM.187,243,244,270
SOA formation pathways are strongly inﬂuenced by climate asshown in multiple regional and global modeling studies.
137,202,271
Future changes in oxidant levels can inﬂuence PM distributions;32
Leibensperger et al.272point out that intercontinental inﬂu-
ences of NO xand CO emissions on PM can exceed those
from SO 2emissions,273particularly in regions with high PM
pollution.3.3 Air pollution episodes
Air pollution events are generally associated with stagnation
events, sometimes coincident with heat waves.196,197,231,274
Even under limited global mean warming scenarios, thefrequency of heat waves may increase.
275–277A warmer climate
is projected to decrease rainfall over southern Europe, creatingwintertime deﬁcits that lowers soil water content for thefollowing seasons, contributing to extreme summertime heatwave conditions.
278A few studies have emphasized positive
feedbacks from vegetation (higher emissions and lower stomatal
deposition) during heat waves.197,278,279Furthermore, the
probability of wildﬁres, a source of pollutant emissions,increases with temperature (Table 1).
Although the record lengths of surface O
3and PM observa-
tions are increasing and allow for new analyses on connectionsbetween extreme pollution events and meteorological condi-tions, additional work is needed to determine their relevanceto the response to changing climate. For example, over theNortheastern United States, Leibensperger et al.
195report a
strong inverse relationship between cyclone frequency in summer,and the number of air stagnation events conducive to high-O
3
episodes and Tai et al.194ﬁnd that stagnant days over the
United States are associated with a 2.6 mgm/C03increase in
PM 2.5in the United States. Appelhans et al.191ﬁnd similar
correlations between winter PM events in Christchurch,New Zealand and daily to inter-annual variations in synopticconditions.
Several modeling studies for the United States and Europe
indicate that high-O
3events are likely to increase in frequency and
duration with climate change8,196,202,209,220,221,223,224,230,244,279–286
but the large variability in the incidence of these events makesprojections of their changes highly uncertain
195,284and models
often disagree at the regional level.6,7,228,248,287Analysis of
centuries-long simulations with CCMs, such as those recentlycompleted for CMIP5 ( e.g., the four models at the bottom of
Table S1, ESI z), should permit an assessment of whether a
climate change signal on pollution episodes can be cleanlyisolated from climate variability.
4. Projections of regional air quality changes over
the next century
The local response of surface O 3and PM to climate-driven
changes depends also on changing spatial patterns of pollutantemissions ( e.g., ref. 140, 141, 194, 205, 207, 285 and 288) and
thus is tied to the future emissions trajectories for greenhousegases and short-lived pollutants. We consider here projectionsfor regional air quality driven by changes in climate and
anthropogenic emissions, both separately (Fig. 3 and 4) and
combined (Fig. 5 and 6). We focus on the multi-model surfaceO
3and PM estimates based on the RCP scenarios:16–22the
transient climate simulations with interactive chemistry con-ducted by several CCMs in support of the Fifth phase of theCoupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5;
289lines and
shading in Fig. 5 and 6); and the decadal ‘‘time slice’’ simula-tions in CCMs and CTMs conducted in support of the Atmo-spheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project(ACCMIP; circles and black vertical bars in Fig. 5 and 6).Downloaded by Columbia University on 15 October 2012

In addition, some results are shown for the SRES emissionspathways
14,290and for alternative, lower pollution pathways
than under the SRES.29Emissions from the biosphere and
lightning NO xgenerally diﬀer across the models, with some
models additionally including climate feedbacks to air pollutantsources and sinks from the biosphere. These CMIP5/ACCMIPresults are a ﬁrst overview; further analysis is in progress.
4.1 Ozone
Projected changes in surface O
3for the near-term (2030 and
2050) due to changes solely in climate or solely in emissions of O 3
precursors show some general patterns across the globe (Fig. 3).The largest surface O
3changes under the recently developed
RCP (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) emission pathways are much smallerthan those projected under the older SRES (A1, A2, B1, B2)scenarios.
17,66Alternative, lower pollutant emission scenarios to
the SRES scenarios (CLE, MFR)29tend to cover the RCP range.
The RCPs assume aggressive control of NO xand other O 3precursor emission controls globally,23falling below the current
legislation (CLE29) 2030 projections and reaching levels by 2050
that are equivalent to maximum feasible reductions (MFR29).
Even within this narrow RCP range for global emissions, larger
regional shifts in emissions occur. We conclude that the emission-driven changes across all available scenarios up to 2050 generallyspan a wider range than the climate-driven changes;
240Fig. 3).
The large spatial regions considered here and the coarse
resolution of the models may mask oppositely signed changeswithin smaller regions ( e.g., within megacities, whose emis-
sions may increase even under emission control scenarios with
nationally declining total emissions
291). Most models do not
consider the impact of land-use changes on biogenic emissionsand thereby air pollution, but some initial work suggests these
impacts could be substantial. For example, Ganzeveld et al.
292
ﬁnd that global changes in land-use and land-cover (LULC)
under the SRES A2 scenario could lead to O 3changes of
B20% by 2050 in the tropics, with increases of 6 ppb over the
Amazon forest and of 9 ppb over the central African rainforest, and smaller changes (less than 5–10%) over populatedregions at northern mid-latitudes. Over the United States,Chen et al.
280suggest LULC can lead to /C65 ppb changes in
surface O 3by 2050 in some locations.

the impacts of regional emission changes in any future pro-jection as these components together determine regional airquality. Rising global emissions (particularly NO
xand CH 4)
can oﬀset O 3decreases obtained with regional emission con-
trols, e.g., ref. 28 and 66 For example, under the RCP8.5
scenario, the O 3decreases over North America are at least
partially oﬀset by rising external sources until 2040, and risingglobal CH
4raises baseline O 3levels over the entire northern
hemisphere (Fig. 4).66The contribution from CH 4to baseline
surface O 3is fairly uniform globally, although the annual
mean O 3sensitivity to CH 4ranges by a factor of two across
individual models.38,58,65,66This uncertainty leads to discre-
pancies in the magnitude and, in the case of Europe under theRCP8.5 scenario, the sign of the overall surface O
3change
(Fig. 4). Future increases in shipping emissions, which aresubjected to less stringent regulations than land-based emis-sion sectors, may also contribute to raising baseline pollutionlevels in some regions.
293,294Both rising baseline O 3levels anda warming climate could contribute to lengthening the O 3
pollution season.28,223,282
Fig. 5 shows projected annual mean surface O 3changes over
the 21st century for selected world regions with the currentgeneration of chemistry–climate models using the RCP trajec-tories. Large inter-annual variations are evident, reﬂecting
model-generated climate variability, with larger variability
over smaller regions, as well as within speciﬁc seasons, andin the frequency of high-O
3events (not shown). The models
span a fairly wide range of O 3responses, consistent with prior
studies,57,65,240so we focus here on the robust features. Under
all of the RCP scenarios, global NO xemissions decline over
the next century (Fig. 1), decreasing surface O 3in all regions
by 2100 with the notable exception of RCP8.5. Comparison ofFig. 5 (which includes changes driven by both emissions andclimate) with previous published RCP emission-only projec-tions to 2050 (see Fig. 8 of Wild et al.
66and Fig. 4 for RCP8.5)
suggests that over many regions, the range in surface O 3
projections is dominated by emission changes. This comparison

CH
4(Fig. 1) increases surface O 3levels (Fig. 4). The strong
warming in RCP8.5 may induce additional discrepanciesbetween Fig. 4 and 5 by altering both regional O

and baseline levels, e.g.ref. 8, 221, 232 and 239.
4.2 Particulate matter
Compared to O 3, we ﬁnd fewer 21st century projections of
PM distributions over the next century. Those that exist arediﬃcult to compare due to variations in study region and
reported PM metrics, with some studies reporting only speciﬁc
PM components (sulfate, nitrate, black carbon, organic) andsizes.
31,186,241,242,244–246,267,295–301Future PM, like O 3, is expected
to be driven by changes in both emissions and climate.
PM changes driven by local-to-regional anthropogenic
emissions are complex, depend on regional oxidant levels(e.g.,ref. 32 and 248), and cannot simply be scaled to changes
in regional emissions. Nevertheless, changes in sulfate aerosolconcentrations generally follow changes in SO
2emissions.
Changes in NO xemissions inﬂuence nitrate aerosols to a lesserextent than the SO 2-sulfate relationship due to competition
between sulfate and nitrate for ammonium, such that nitrateaerosol is inversely dependent on sulfate. Increases in ammonia(NH
3) emissions in conjunction with SO 2reductions enhance
nitrate aerosol, oﬀsetting some of beneﬁt from SO 2controls.241
Continued reductions in SO 2emissions alongside rising NH 3
emission could lead to nitrate aerosol levels equivalent to or
larger than sulfate aerosol levels in some regions over the21st century.
295,301Projected changes in U.S. aerosol for 2050
are dominated by anthropogenic emission changes except inregions where large precipitation changes are projected

or those that are heavily impacted by wildﬁres.204Future growth
in anthropogenic aromatic emissions could lead to a largeranthropogenic contribution to secondary organic aerosol.

Over South and East Asia, the PM 2.5projections do not rank
according to the RCP RFs. Instead, RCP6.0 represents thehigh end of the PM
2.5range and RCP4.5 represents the low
end. Over South Asia, the PM 2.5projections are strongly tied
to the OC emissions (Fig. 7). South Asian SO 2emissions
decline similarly under all of the RCPs, with the exceptionof RCP6.0 in which SO
2emissions may contribute to raising
PM 2.5relative to the other RCP scenarios from 2050 to 2070
(Fig. 7). Over East Asia, the diﬀerent PM 2.5projections likely
reﬂect a combination of the changes in SO 2and carbonaceous
aerosols (Fig. 7).
5. Bridging knowledge gaps
Multi-decadal and multi-century simulations with fully
coupled chemistry–climate models as summarized in Fig. 5
and 6 oﬀer a new approach to study interactions betweenclimate and air quality. In particular, these models providenew opportunities to isolate an anthropogenic climate signalon air quality relative to that from climate variability, whichhas not been possible in most published studies to date. Someof the models also include a well-resolved stratosphere,enabling assessment of the impact of stratospheric changes,including ozone depletion and recovery, on troposphericozone and the tropospheric oxidizing capacity. Inclusion ofprognostic aerosol–cloud interactions in these models further
allows for new insights into the processes contributing toregional climate responses to aerosol forcings. Ongoing com-munity eﬀorts to evaluate rigorously the current generationof chemistry–climate and chemical transport models withprocess-level observational and laboratory constraints should
help bridge knowledge gaps. We focus below on a few areas
where current research eﬀorts are expected to advance knowl-edge rapidly.
Informing air pollution and climate change mitigation
One of the more robust conclusions from work over the past
decade is that CH
4controls are a viable strategy for joint
mitigation of climate warming and global O 3pollution ( e.g.,
ref. 30, Section 2.1). Abating CH 4should help to oﬀset some
of warming expected from continued removal of atmosphericaerosol (sulfate) motivated by improving public health. Thequantitative impact of CH
4oxidation on baseline surface O 3is
uncertain, with the full model range spanning a factor oftwo.
66Narrowing this range likely requires better constraints
on global NO xdistributions;38,58new space-based approaches
may be particularly useful.302–308
Black carbon mitigation is another approach under con-
sideration to improve air quality and lessen global warming,
with several emission control strategies identiﬁed30but sub-
stantial uncertainty remains regarding the varied roles bywhich black carbon aﬀects climate (Section 2.2). Recentadvances have been made in characterizing and propagatinguncertainties through the multitude of processes governing theemission of radiatively active species and their atmosphericdistributions and climate impacts.
38,309,310Additional work is
needed to extend these uncertainty analyses to other chemicalspecies and anthropogenic sectors. By identifying which pro-cesses contribute most to uncertainties, these approaches inform
the science community as to where future investments may be
most salient.
Evaluating chemistry–climate models
A wide range of model estimates exists for regional air quality
both at present and in the future, even along a given emissiontrajectory (Fig. 3–6). Growing record lengths of historically
observed relationships between relevant meteorological vari-
ables and air quality provide useful information for evaluatingmodels ( e.g.ref. 194, 205, 226, 311–314) and may also help to
improve our understanding of the links between air qualityand climate though further study is required. Space-basedconstraints on instantaneous radiative forcing from O
3
and aerosols could aid in characterizing model bias in RFestimates.
76,83,315,316These observational approaches, com-
bined with multi-model analysis that seeks to link diﬀerencesacross models to speciﬁc processes
317–319would help to reduce
uncertainties in both present-day and projected air pollution
estimates.
Constraining chemical mechanisms
Fundamental questions remain in our mechanistic understanding
that severely limit conﬁdence in projecting future air quality ina changing climate. For example, meta-analysis indicates that
Fig. 7 RCP emissions (2000–2100) of aerosols and precursor emis-
sions from anthropogenic plus biomass burning sources, averaged
over two of the regions in Fig. 6 and 7 (East Asia, left column; South
Asia, right column).Downloaded by Columbia University on 15 October 2012

the treatment of organic nitrates (RONO 2), speciﬁcally those
from isoprene.6,7,320The rate at which RONO 2reacts to
recycle NO xis poorly understood321,322and ranges from
0–100% are used in CCMs and CTMs; this range aﬀects thesign of the O
3response to changes in BVOC emissions.323–326
Chemical mechanisms that include RONO 2formation without
recycling NO xviasubsequent reaction display little biogenic
VOC-ozone-climate sensitivity,8and mechanisms that ignore
RONO 2altogether show large biogenic VOC-ozone-climate
sensitivity.242There is additional uncertainty in the RONO 2
yield from isoprene oxidation with laboratory yields rangingfrom 4–12% ( e.g., see summary in Horowitz et al. ,
324and
newer ﬁndings327,328). Knowledge of BVOC oxidation and
subsequent SOA formation is advancing rapidly but uncer-tainties remain.
54,132,140,329Aerosol–oxidant interactions also
require further study as they may determine PM air quality in
some regions.32,272
Oceanic reactive halogen species released into the atmo-
sphere by the photodecomposition of organohalogens (includingiodine-containing species) and viaautocatalytic recycling on
sea-salt aerosols contribute to O
3destruction and may play
an important role in both pre-industrial and present-day O 3
budgets and tropospheric oxidizing capacity.330–335Tropo-
spheric halogen chemistry is not included in the model projec-tions reviewed here (Fig. 3–6).
Reducing uncertainty in aerosol forcing
A new generation of global models allows deeper study at the
process level as they include aerosol microphysics and prognosticaerosol cloud interactions. However, large variability betweenmodels
87,130highlights the need for detailed evaluation of aerosol
microphysical schemes before uncertainty in aerosol forcing can
be reduced. Synthesis of ﬁeld observations to develop datasets
with global coverage to evaluate models will be important. Newapproaches are also required to understand the microphysicalprocesses that are most responsible for model diversity helping toprioritize future research directions.
336
Identifying robust regional air pollution and climate responses
The northern mid-latitudes have garnered the most attention
in the literature in terms of air quality and climate interactions;more work is needed to understand the future evolution of airquality in the tropics and southern hemisphere. More reliableprojections of air quality require conﬁdence in the regionalclimate responses, including precipitation, the positioningof mid-latitude storm tracks and subtropical high pressuresystems as well as convection ( e.g., ref. 6, 7 and 337). Improved
understanding of the spatially resolved global climate response
as compared with the regional climate response to locallychanging O
3and aerosols from speciﬁc emission control
strategies (including eﬀects on the hydrologic cycle, tempera-ture and circulation) is needed, particularly for the NTCFs inorder to bypass current limitations in the global RF metric.However, identifying a statistically signiﬁcant signal detectableover internal climate model variability for relatively smallnet climate impacts from regional or sectoral emissions repre-sents a non-trivial challenge and may even be impossible.
338The published literature debates whether the spatial pattern ofthe future surface temperature response to aerosol forcingmirrors that from greenhouse-gas forcing or rather followsthe local aerosol forcing patterns.
108,111,112,339–341A multi-
model analysis begins to reconcile these previous ﬁndings,indicating a strong sensitivity of the surface temperature
response to the latitudinal forcing distribution but limited
sensitivity to longitude.
342Regional precipitation may be
particularly sensitive (both sign and magnitude) to aerosolforcing location.
131
Advancing knowledge of anthroposphere–biosphere interactions
Human interactions with the terrestrial biosphere are a major
uncertainty but crucial to understand because vegetation actsas both a source and a sink for many air pollutants ( e.g.,
ref. 13 and 199). The attribution of O
3and PM air pollution
between ‘‘anthropogenic’’ and ‘‘biogenic’’ sources is compli-cated by chemistry that involves both anthropogenic andbiogenic precursors for both O
3and aerosol,141,343and by
land-use changes which alter biogenic sources ( e.g., ref. 344
and 345). A major uncertainty regarding BVOC feedbacks isthe opposing inﬂuences of rising CO
2versus rising temperature.346
Sources from agriculture and livestock sectors are generally
poorly constrained but non-negligible, particularly for CH 4347
and NH 3.348Human-driven changes in land-use and land
cover, such as urbanization or shifts between forests and
agriculture, could dramatically alter future O 3and aerosol
precursor emissions from the biosphere187,189,279as well as dry
deposition,188and should be considered in future assessments.

Inhomogeneous forcing and transient
climate sensitivity
Drew T. Shindell
Understanding climate sensitivity is critical to projecting
climate change in response to a given forcing scenario.
Recent analyses1–3have suggested that transient climate
sensitivity is at the low end of the present model rangetaking into account the reduced warming rates during the past10–15 years during which forcing has increased markedly

observations indicate that the most realistic models havehigher sensitivities
5,6. Here I analyse results from recent
climate modelling intercomparison projects to demonstrate
that transient climate sensitivity to historical aerosols and
ozone is substantially greater than the transient climatesensitivity to CO
2. This enhanced sensitivity is primarily caused
by more of the forcing being located at Northern Hemispheremiddle to high latitudes where it triggers more rapid land
responses and stronger feedbacks. I ﬁnd that accounting for
this enhancement largely reconciles the two sets of results, andI conclude that the lowest end of the range of transient climateresponse to CO
2in present models and assessments7(<1.3◦C)
is very unlikely.
Modelled transient climate responses were in good agreement
withtheunderstandingofhistoricalforcingandobservedwarmingtrends in most analyses to ~2006 (ref. 8). Recent measurementsposed a problem, however: warming rates were slower during the

duetointernalvariability,analysesinboththescientificliterature1,2
and the popular press3accounting for those factors concluded
that climate sensitivity is likely towards the low end of presentmodels’range.
Inferring climate sensitivity from recent observations requires
a thorough understanding of both recent forcing and the global
mean response to various forcing agents. Although the forcing hasbeenstudiedindetail,theglobalmeanresponsehasconventionallybeen assumed to be the same for all forcing agents (in all such
analyses, not only the most recent). I examine the response to

part of CMIP5 (ref. 10), but were relegated to a low priority
and few results are available. Hence to examine the response toaerosols and ozone, I analyse CMIP5 historical simulations of theresponse to all forcings (histAll), to well-mixed greenhouse gas
(WMGHG) forcing (histGHG) and to natural forcing (histNat),
using the residual of histAll −(histGHG +histNat )following two
methods.Method1assumesthatstratosphericwatervapourforcinginducesaresponsesimilartoWMGHGs,sothattheresidual(with
scaled histGHG) represents the response to aerosol +ozone +

negativeLUforcing,leavingaresidualrepresentingonlyaerosols +
ozone(Methods).
Iincludetheeightmodelsforwhichforcingduetoaerosolsand

11and all of these transient historical
climate simulations are available. I evaluate the transient climateresponse (TCR), defined as the global mean temperature change
in response to gradually increasing (1% yr
−1)CO 2at the time
of its doubling in a given model12(all values annual averages).
For consistency, the response to other forcings, which I refer tomore generally as transient climate sensitivity, is given using thesame scale (that is, the response per unit forcing times a model’s
doubled CO
2forcing). Uncertainty in the TCR for a particular
model stems from both the responses and the forcings, with thepoorly documented LU forcing contributing the largest fraction inthesecalculations.
All of the available CMIP5 models show greater TCR for

However,thereis ∼0.2◦Clesspresentwarmingaccountingforthe

These results have several additional implications. Forcing in
CMIP5 models has been estimated assuming that all forcing
agents have a similar forcing/response relationship as the onefor WMGHG (ref. 13). Such an analysis would systematicallyoverestimate net aerosol +ozone forcing (the dependence of this
method on constant regional warming and feedback patterns has
been noted
25). Similarly, global mean temperature responses to
projected aerosol and ozone forcing would be underestimated ifthe forcing distribution is not accounted for. Such biases aﬀectsimple box model calculations
26, and lead to underestimates of
aerosol impacts in calculations using simple models27relative to
analogous calculations using full three-dimensional composition–climatemodels

As there is a high correlation between TCR and equilibrium
climate sensitivity, the results suggest the lowest end of model

with palaeoclimate evidence29). Further work is clearly needed to

Methods
I examine all models for which both historical climate simulations and forcing
diagnostics are available (see also Sup plementary Information). I exclude
NCAR-CAM3.5 and bcc-csm1-1 as they omit aerosol indirect eﬀects. I alsoexclude GISS-E2-R as this model overestimates negative SH nitrate aerosol and
ozone forcing
11,30, so that its NH and SH forcings are quite similar, making its
historical runs unsuited to studying the impact of hemispherically asymmetric

forcing (other models have substantially greater hemispheric forcing gradients).
Although they may be biased, historical aerosol-only simulations with that modelare included because there are only four available models and these results are
used only in a single comparison complementing the primary analysis. This
results in eight available models in the primary analysis (Supplementary Table 1).
The residual of histAll −(histGHG +histNat )includes not only the response
to aerosols and ozone, but also to LU and stratospheric water, as well as any
nonlinearities. The forcings are ch aracterized as follows. Doubled CO
2forcing
estimated using the fixed-sea surface temperature (SST) method in individual
models is used when available12, with estimates derived by linear regression used
in the few cases when fixed-SST simulations were not performed13. HistGHG
forcing has been diagnosed from the CMIP5 simulations using linear regression13.
I use these for all models except for CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, MRI-CGCM3 andHadGEM2, for which the regression-based analysis yielded values quite diﬀerent
from values using fixed-SSTs (which is used for aerosol forcing) in an earlier
analysis
12. For those models, fixed-SST results are used if available, and otherwise
regression-method estimates are adjus ted on the basis of the diﬀerences between
the two methods (Supplementary Information). Ozone forcing is from ACCMIPanalyses
11, with the value for a few models that use prescribed ozone changes set
to0.27±0.14Wm−2, based on forcing calculations for those data sets
(Supplementary Information), and using the multi-model mean spatial pattern.For LU, I take the central estimate of forcing as −0.085Wm
−2with a range of
the same magnitude so that −0.17Wm−2is the high-end forcing and the
low-end forcing is zero (see Supplementary Information). The exception to this is
the NorESM1-M model, which does not have LU forcing and hence a value of
zero is used. For stratospheric water, I use a value of 0.07±0.05Wm−2following
the most recent assessment4. I then analyse the response to inhomogeneous
forcing, histAll −(histGHG +histNat ), in two ways: (Method 1) assuming the
response to stratospheric water vapour is the same as that for WMGHG becauseit is similarly distributed globally (that is, the histGHG response is multiplied by
(F
WMGHG +0.07 )/FWMGHG,w h e r e Fis forcing), and hence the residual represents
aerosol +ozone +LU, and (Method 2) assuming the LU and stratospheric water
forcings oﬀset one another, and hence the unmodified residual represents aerosol
+ozone (see also Supplementary Information).
For this analysis, I compare simulated temperatures for 2000 (average over
1996–2005) with those during 1850–1859 (although for GFDL-CM3 I use
1860–1869 for the first period, the earliest available; and for HadGEM2 I usedDecember 1859–November 1869 and December 1995–November 2005), with
model drift removed by subtracting changes over the same time periods in
control runs. Temperature averages are taken over up to five available ensemble
members. Values are very similar to those I obtain with these decadal diﬀerences
when instead using linear regression over the full length of the simulations
13.
TCR for the models is simply given by the simulated temperature change
divided by the imposed forcing, all multiplied by the doubled CO 2forcing
(Supplementary Information). To calculate TCR from observations, using theequation given in the text, forcing from solar and contrails is taken as 0.1Wm
−2
in total4. Uncertainties in TCR are computed with a Monte Carlo approach
incorporating uncertainties in historical temperature change, forcing and
response enhancement for inhomogeneous forcing (the value of E), all of which
are assumed to be independent. Given tha t the TCR incorporating the enhanced
response to inhomogeneous aerosol forcing is quite sensitive to the magnitude of
that forcing, the results are in turn quite sensitive to the assumed reduction of the
modelled aerosol forcing values. For example, if I do not include the 0.3Wm−2
bias-adjustment to the aerosol forcing, the mean TCR increases by 0.7◦C. As I
used the smaller aerosol forcing value including this adjustment in the TCR
calculation from observed surface temperature changes, I reduced the range ofthe positive uncertainty on the aerosol forcing, but further work is needed to
better constrain aerosol forcing.

As background for consideration of the climates of the other terrestrial planets in our solar 
system and the potential habitability of rocky exoplanets. we discuss the basic physics that 
controls the Earth's present climate. with particular emphasis on the energy and water cycles. 
We define several dimensionless parameters relevant to characterizing a planet's general cir­
culation. climate. and hydrological cycle. We also consider issues associated with the use of 
past climate variations as indicators of future anthropogenically forced climate change. and 
recent advances in understanding projections of future climate that might have implications 
for Earth-like exoplanets . 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The amazing diversity of atmospheric behavior seen in 
our own solar system represents a challenge to our funda­
mental understanding of atmosphe ric physics. The weather 
and climate of Earth, explored extensively during the past 
century, provide an invaluable basis for understand ing this 
diversity. Yet Earth's atmosphere occupies only one part of 
the parameter space of factors that can affect weather and 
climate. The extent to which our terrestrial assumptions 
carry over to other planets must continually be evaluated. 
A planetary perspective on Earth can help us decide which 
features that we take for granted are unique to our planet 
and which it has in common with subsets of other planets. 
The rapidly growing list of discovered exoplanets, and the 
need to assess which of these mighllie in the habitable zone 
(see Domagal-Go ldman and Segura. this volume). stretches 
our assumed understanding of Earth. Furthermore. increas­
ing evidence of conditions during Earth's own past, as well 
as the urgency to be able to predict important features of 
future anthropogenically forced climate change, has led to a 
resurgence in fundamenlal studies of E.'l.rth's present climate 
in recent years. The science of comparative planetary clima­
tology is indeed coupled to queslions of our own planet's 
past and future habitability (see Foreword to this volume). 
Although there is still much we do nOl understand 
about our own climate system, orders of magnitude more 
theoretical, observational, and modeling effort has been 
devoted to our planetllian any other. Thus, for solar system 
or exoplanet researchers reading this book. we hope that 
starting with a discussion of Earth will provide a useful, 
even necessary. foundation for thinking about conditions 
on other planets. For terrestrial scientists, we hope that the 
planetary perspective of Earth presented in this chapter 
will stimulate thinking about the features that make Earth 
unique in our solar system. The lime has never been riper 
for such thinking, since the advent of general circulation 
3 models (GCMs) (see Dowling, this volume) run on high­
pcrfonnance computing platforms now makes it possible 
to ask almost any imaginable ""What if ... 1"" question 
about Earth and the physics that control its climate. This 
chapter assumes a knowledge of basic atmospheric science; 
derivations and further discussion of many of the principles 
presented here can be found in textbooks such as HOllghtoll 
(2002) and Wallace and Hobbs (2006). 
2. THE ENERGY AND WATER CYCLES 
New estimates of the solar irradiance of Earth (KOIJP 
and Lean. 2011) indicate a value So = 1360.8 W/m2 at 
solar minimum. considerably lower than previous estimates 
(see Harder and Woods, this volume). This so-called solar 
constant actually fluctuates by -0.1 W/m2 over the II-year 
solar cycle. an inconsequential variation for Earth's climate. 
Averaged over the Earth, the absorbed shortwave (SW) flux 
equals the emitted longwave (LW) flux in equilibrium (see 
Covey et a\., this volume): 
S, (1-A) 
4d2 aT' , (1 ) 
where A = 0.293 is the planetary albedo (Loeb el al .. 
2009), d the planet-Sun distance in astronomical units (=1 
for Earth). 0' the Stefan-Bo ltzmann constant. and Te the 
effective temperature of a blackbody that would produce 
the observed LW flux. Actually. Earth is currently out of 
equilibrium by -0.6 W/Ill'2 due to anthropogenic emissions 
of greenhouse gases and other climate forcings (Lyman et 
a/ .. 2010). 
Figure I shows the contributions to the global energy 
balance at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA). within the atmos­
pheric column. and at the surface (Stephells et a/.. 2012). 
Clouds account for almost half of Earth's planetary albedo; 
the other half is made up of almost equal contributions from 4 ComparUlh·t C/imQl%gy ofTtrrutrial Planets

the clear atmosphere (aerosol scattering and gaseous Ray· 
leigh scattering) and the surface. The outgoing LW flux to 
space comes almost entirely from the atmosphere, with only 
an 8% contribution from the surface thai escapes through 
the atmosphe ric thennal infrared window. Even in clear 
skies. the surface only contribute s -25% of the emission 
to space because of the LW opacity of greenhouse gases 
(Costa and Shille. 2012). 
Earth's atmosphere is fairly transparent to our Sun's 
radiation. which peaks in the visible; -22% is absorbed 
within the atmosphere, primarily due to O2 and 0) in the 
ultraviolet, H20 in the near-infrared. and absorbing aero­
sols in the visible. The SW flux that reaches the surface is 
primarily (-88%) absorbed . The surface energy budget is 
balanced largely by upward surface turbulent latent and heal 
fluxes and partly by the net (up-down) LW flux (see Show­
man et aI., this volume). The LW contribution is secondary 
because atmospheric absorbers induce a downward LW flux 
that offsets much orthe upward emission from the surface. 
Tc in equation (I) = 255 K, 33 K colder than Earth's 
surface temperature T, = 288 K. The difference is a measure 
of Earth's greenhouse effect (see Covey et al.. this volume) 
due to LW absorbers. Water vapor accounts for -50% of 
the greenhouse effect. followed by clouds (-25%), CO2 
(-19%), and other absorbing gases and particulates (-7%) 
(Schmidt et ai .• 2010). These relative contribution s obscure 
the fact that CO2 is actually the primary driver of Earth's 
climate, since water vapor is controlled (largely via the 
Clausius-Clapeyron equation of thermodynami cs) by the 
heating due to CO2 and other noncondensable greenhouse 
gases (Locis et ai"" 2010). Figure 2, for example, shows 
that when CO2 and other noncondensable greenhouse 
gases are removed from an Earth GCM, the planet cools by _35°C and the water vapor content is reduced by 90%. 
On Titan (see Griffith et a!., this volume), the noncondens­
able absorber H2 exerts a similar control on the climate by 
regulating the concentra tion of the condensable gas CH4 
(McKay el al .• 1991). 
Figure 3 shows the geographic distribution of the 
TOA absorbed SW and outgoing LW flux in clear skies.

and the difference between that and the total fluxes in all 
conditions, known as the ""cloud forcing"" or ""cloud radia­
tive effect"" (Loeb el 01., 2009). The clear sky SW flull is 
dominated by the solar zenith angle variation with latitude. 
but departure s from the zonal mean at each latitude reveal 
radiatively important details of Earth's surface: minima 
over bright ice-covered Greenland and Antarctica and to a 
lesser extent over the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice packs. 
maxima over the dark oceans, and inlemlediate values over 
other land surfaces. 
The other fluxes are regulated primarily by the atmos­
phere and are thus indicators of the general circulation. 
Earth's ""tropical"" and ""extralropical""' dynamical regimes 
are determined by its radius, rotation period, and ther­
modynamic structure (see Showman et al., this volume). 
Low-level moisture co~verge nce and deep convection in the 
rising branch of the Hadley cell maximize the greenhouse 
effect near the equalOr and produce a minimum in clear sky 
LW flux to space there relative to the flux maxima in the 
surroundin g subtropical dry subsidence regions. Otherwise 
the clear sky flux reflects primarily the decrease in tempera­
ture and water vapor with latitude. Longwave cloud forcing 
(which is positive because clouds reduce LW emission to 
space and thus warm the planet) peaks coincide with the 
tropical locations of deep convection; secondary maxima exist in the exuatropical storm tracks. Shortwave cloud 
forcing (which is negative because clouds are brighter than 
most of Earth's surface and thus cool the planet) also is 
large in magnitude in these regions. Other SW cloud forc­
ing maxima exist off the west coasts of the continents but 
with no corresponding LW signal. These are locations of 
low-level marine stratocumulus decks whose tops are below 
the clear sky emission to space level. Globally averaged, 
SW cooling by clouds exceeds LW warming by -17 W/m2. 
i.e., the net effect of clouds is to cool the current climate. 
Aerosols (Fig. 4) have three qualitatively different effects 
on the climate: (I) Direcl effects due to their interaction 
with (mostly SW) radiation (M)'hre, 2009). Since most aero­
sol types (sulfates, nitrates. sea salt, and organic carbon) are 
bright. they cool Earth. However, black carbon and mineral 
dust absorb SW radiation; this cools the surface by prevent­
ing sunlight from reaching it but warms the atmosphere 
and the planel as a whole. This is analogous 10 Ihe ""anti­
greenhouse"" effect of absorbing hydrocarbo n hazes on Titan 
(McKay et al., 1991; Griffith et al., this volume), but with a 
smaller magnitude. (2) Indirect effects due to the interaction 
of aerosols with clouds (McComiskey and Feingold, 2012). 
Aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and affect the 
number concentration and size of cloud droplets. With an 
increase in aerosols, the available water is shared among 6 Cotnpllml;l~ Climatology ofTf!rrnlrial Planf!IS 
more but smaller droplets, increasing their area/volume ratio 
and thus making the cloud more reflective. Smaller cloud 
droplets may also affect the microphysics and dynamics of 
clouds, but the magnitud e of this effect is quite uncenain. 
(3) Semj·(Jirect effects due to the influence of warming 
by absorbing aerosols on the atmospher ic thermodynamic 
slIUcture (Koch and Del Genio, 20 I 0). For example, marine 
stratocumulu s clouds that occur under strong inversions may 
become more widespread if an absorbing aerosol advected 
from an adjacent continent increases the inversion strength. 
The geographic distribution of aerosols (Baller Cl ai.. 
20(8) is determined by natural and anthropogeni c sources, 
tropospheric chemical reactions. wet and dry deposition, and 
advection by the general circulation. Sulfate and nitrate arc 
largely of anthropogenic origin and are concentrated ncar 
and downwind of industrial. lransponation, and agricultural 
sources. Organic and black. carbon are most prevalent in 
regions of biomass burning, but also have imponant in· 
dustrial and transponalion sources. Mineral dust is mostly 
natural in origin, the largest source region being the Sahara 
and Arabian desens. Sea salt is produced mainly in oceanic 
regions of strong surface winds such as the extratropical 
storm lrncks. 
Allhough the TOA·absorbed SW and outgoing LW 
radiative fluxes must balance globally for the climate to 
be in equilibrium , this is not true locally. In fact, there is 
a latitudinall y varying imbalance of net radiative heating 
on Earth (Fig. 5): The tropics receives more sunlight than 
the heat it emilS to space, while higher latitudes emit more 
than they absorb. In equilibrium this must be offset by the 
transport of heat from low to high latitudes. This is Ihe fundamental driver of the circulations of the atmosphere 
and ocean (Trenberlh alld Caron. 2001). The atmospheric 
component of heat lrnnspon is accomplished primarily by 
the Hadley circulation in the tropics and by synoptic·scale 
eddies created by baroclinic instability in the extralropic s 
(see Showman et aI., this volume) and dominate s at high 
latitudes. The ocean circulation contribution (0 transport 
dominate s at low latitudes (Fig. 6). 
The ocean circulation has two fundamental components: 
a surface circulation in the top -100 OJ driven by the 
frictional interaction with atmospheri c surface winds and 
the Coriolis force, and a themlohaline circulation driven 
by density gradients due to temperature and salinity dif· 
ferences. The surface winds created by Earth's three·cell 
mean meridional circulation produce tropical easterly and 
extratropical westerly ocean currents. At longitudina l con­
tinental boundarie s. the easterlies are deflected poleward 
and the westerlies equatorward. fonning roughly circular 
ocean gyres in each ocean basin and hemisphere . The 
gyres transport warm water poleward off the east coasts 
of the continents and cold water equatorward ofT the west 
coasts, effecting a net poleward heat transport (Klinger 
arid Marotz}ce, 2000). The wind·driven transpon may be an 
important factor in limiting sea ice expansion to the tropics 
in ""snowball Earth"" scenarios (Poulsen and Jacob, 2004; 
Rose tmd Marshall, 2009). At high latitudes. dense (cold 
and/or salty) water sinks to the ocean bottom and slowly 
circulates to lower latitudes. High·salinity water is produced 
by net evaporation (i.e., in excess of precipitation) and the 
formation of sea ice, which cannot easily accommodate salt 
and thus produces salty ocean water where it occurs. The

adding to the poleward heat transport (Broecker, 199i). The 
removal of dense surface water to the deep ocean takes it 
out of thennal contact with the atmosphere until it returns 
to the surface at low latitudes much laler. This implies that 
the effects of changes in greenhouse gas concentrations will 
not fully be reflected in surface temperature s for centuries. 
perhaps even a millennium or more (Hansen et al., 1985). 
Stone (1978a) argued that the total meridional heat trans­
port is controlled by external parameters (solar constant. 
planet size, and obliquity ) and the planetary albedo. and 
thus that the details of partitioning between atmosphere 
and ocean are unimportant. This would be good news for 
exoplanet science. since nothing is known about possible 
oceans on exoplanets. However. Enderton and Marshall 
(2009) show that in an ideali7.ed ""aquaplanet"" Earth GCM. 
Stone's conclusion is valid only for wann. ice·free climates. 
Ferreira et al. (201 I) find that multiple equilibria. from 
ice-free to ice--covered (""snowball"") states are possible in 
such models. Figure 7 compares two versions of an Earth 
atmospheric GCM coupled to a mixed-layer ocean with 
specified ocean heat transports. One has transports calcu­
lated to produce observed sea surface temperature s -a 
""Q-flux"" model (Hansen et al., 1984) -and another has 
ocean heat transports turned off. The atmosphere has clearly 
not compensated for the absence of ocean heat transport. 
leading to much more extensive sea ice coverage and a 
clearly different climate for the same external forcing. 
Vertical heat transport is just as important in determin­
ing the Earth's climate. The simplest assumption for the 
vertical lhennodynamic structure is to assume lhat il is in 
radiative equilibrium. i.e., the temperature profile is such 
that the divergence of the radiative flux is zero at all levels.

atmosphere becomes optically thicker. (An exception to 
this rule is a planet such as Mars wilh large day-night TJ 
contrasts: see Rafldn et al. and Covey et ai., this volume).

planet and y is the fraction of this flux that is absorbed 
within the atmosphere (see Covey et aI., this volume). 
Equations (2a) and (2b) are not quantitatively accurate but 
capture lhe basic physics of how the atmosphere radiatively 
modulate s surface temperature. 
Models that lead to equation (2a) inherently produce a 
surface-atmosphere temperature discontinuity because the 
surface absorbs all the incident SW radiation. Furthermore , 
the Tsthey predict considerably exceeds the observed T, for 
realistic t*. More sophisticated one-dimensional radiative 
equilibrium models also indicate that the lower troposphere

applied to limit lapse rates and produces a realistic Ts and

by convection reduces Ihe sensitivity of Ts 10 changes in 
atmospheric composition or insolation. 
Observation s indicate that Earth's tropical lapse rate 
in the free troposphere is close to moist adiabatic up to 
-400 hPa (Zelinka and lIartmaml. 2011). indicating that 
moist convection is the controlling process up to that level 
(Fig. 8). This is possible because over the warm tropical 
oceans. lhe boundary layer is sufficiently humid for moist 
convection 10 occur frequently enough to adjust conditionally unstable lapse rates to ncar-neutral stability. This is not the 
case over the cooler tropical ocean regions. but the weak 
tropical Coriolis force allows advection to adjust the free 
troposphere lapse rate there to a value close to that in the 
warmer ocean regions (see Showman et al .. this volume). 
Over tropical land. where moisture is not always available 
and the surface temperature responds more quickly to solar 
healing. more unstable lapse rutes can sometimes occur: con­
sequently. continenta l cOllvective updraft speeds are stronger 
than those over ocean (Zipser and Lutz. 1994). Above the

flux the atmosphere provides to the ocean. Figures courtesy of M. Way. Poleward of _300 latitude, the tropospheric lapse rate is 
more stable than predicted by the moist adiabatic lapse rate. 
Surprisingly, extratropica l static stability (proportionai to the 
difference between the dry adiabatic and actual lapse rate) 
is not understood as well as tropical static stability despite 
our firmer understanding of extratropical quasi ·geostrophic 
dynamics. StOlle (l978b) suggested that the lapse rate is set 
by the requirement that dry baroclinic eddies associated 
with latitudinallemperature gradients adjust the atmosphere 
to a baroclinically neutral state. More recent work indicates 
that the extratropieal lapse rate is affected by synoptic 
transports by both baroclinic eddies and moist convection 
(Frierson, 2008), but there is not universal agreement on 
the details. An effective static stability that is based on 
the moist adiabat but also accounts for dry downwelling 
circulations and meridional temperature gradients appears 
to hold promise (O'Gorman, 2011). 
Equilibrium of the water cycle requires that on climate 
timescales, global mean precipitation P must balance global 
mean evaporation E. Just as for the energy cycle, though, the 
local water cycle is not balanced between sources and sinks 
(Trenberth el af., 2(07). Instead, the surface watcr balance 
E--P reflects the general circulation, with P > E in the moist 
equatorial rising branch of the Hadley cell and the extratropi· 
cal stom\ uacks. and E> P in the dry subtropical descending 
branches of the Hadley cell (Fig. 9). Thc general circulation 
offsets these imbalances, with nct moisture convergence into 
the equatorial region (hence the name Intertropical Conver­
gence Zone) and net moisture divergence from the subtropics. 
Thus a significant amount of tropical precipitation does nOi 
originate from locally evaporated water. 
The existence of tropical and extratropical dynamical 
regimes (see Showman et al., this volume) on Eanh, plus the 
presence of preferred upwelling and downwelling regions 
in each, creates four basic climate or habitabilit y zones: 
(1) equatorial. characterized by weak stratification , high 
humidity, and regular though intermiUent strong precipita­
tion; (2) subtropical, with weak stratificatio n (except for 
low-level inversions) but low humidity, and therefore weak 
precipitation; (3) midlarirude , with stronger stratification and 
high humidity, and therefore regular slowly varying mod­
erate precipitation; and (4) polar, characterized by strong 
stratification and low humidity, and thus weak precipitation. 
Life exists in each of these zones, but the morc extreme 
conditions and life forms of the subtropical and polar desert 
regimes are less likely to be detected from space, The more 
abundant life that thrives in the more heavily precipitating 
equatorial and midlatitud e regimes is more likely to provide 
an exoplanet biosignature, 
A similar water cycle imbalance applies 10 different 
surface types. The oceans evaporate -10% more water than 
they precipitate , and vice versa for land (Fig. 10). Thus there 
is a net atmospheric transport of water from ocean to land, 
implying that in some regions. continental precipitation 
is provided more by remote ocean sources than by local 
evapotranspiration. Water returns to the ocean via surface 
runoff and subsurface groundwater flow. Ott Genio: Physical Proct!Sses COli/roiling &mh's Climalt! 9 
AI TOA, the energy cycle is purely radiative, as given 
by equation (I). However, at the surface and within the 
atmosphere, the energy cycle (Fig. I) and water cycle 
(Fig. 10) are directly coupled. At the surface, the turbulent 
fluxes that balance most of the absorbed sunlight (Fig. I) are

i.e., the Bowen ratio of sensible to latent heat flux is small. 
while ovcr land the ratio varies considerably according to

turbulent fluxes from the surface, mostly by the latent heat 
flux when watcr vapor condenses and precipitates (sec 
Showman et al., this volume). Thus, precipitation in GCMs 
depends not only directly on thc physical processcs that 
produce precipitation (e.g .• moist convcction), but indirectly 
on phenomena whose direct influences are only radiative 
(e.g .. the areal coverage of nonprccipitating stratocumulus

3, DIMENSIONLESS NUMBERS AS 
CLIMATE INDICATORS 
To translate this knowledge to other planets and an­
ticipatc similarities and differences, we need to understand 
why particular processes control particular aspects of the 
climate. In general, when multiple processes occur, the 
fastest process dominates, and so it is instructive to define 
characteristic time or length scales for different proccsses 
and foml appropriat e dimensionless ratios to asscss thcir 
importance.

To organize our thinking about the importance of moist 
processes and the combined temperature and water condi­
tions that are most conducive to supporting life. it is useful 
to define several energy and water-related timescales that 
might be relevant to assessments of habitability : 
1. The radiative time constant trad = pcpT/gF is the ratio 
of atmospheric heat content to the rate of radiative cooling 
to space F of a layer of depth one scale height. An analogous 
time constant with suitable values of Ihe heat capacilY for 
different thicknesses of fluid can be used to explain the tim­
escales on which the ocean mixed layer, thermocline, and 
deep ocean respond to radiative perturbat ions at the surface. 
2. The residence lime of waler Ires = PW/P, similarly 
defined as the ratio of the column water vapor content 
PW to Ihe precipitation rate P, measures the vigor of the 
hydrologic cycle. {HI Gtnio: Physical PrrxUStS Controllins &lnh's CUmatt 11 
3. The dynamicaltimescales for synoptic scale weather 
variability (Ids = UU), where L is a typical length scale for 
synoptic flow; for planetary scale heat transport (Idp = aIV), 
where V is a typical mean meridional wind speed; and for 
convective adjustment of the lapse rate (loon = H/W). where 
H is the scale height and W a typical convective updraft 
speed. assess the importanc e of transports by different 
dynamical mechanisms. 
4. External astronomical timescales such as the diurnal 
(I<II.y) and seasonal (tyear) timescales measure the importance 
of variations in solar/stellar forcing. 
From these time constants a variety of potentially useful 
dimensionless numbers can be constructed. For example. 
numerical weather prediction models of Eanh need not 
acknowledge the rising and setting of the Sun to predict the 
arrival of a low pressure center and rain in 24 hr because

A useful measure of the role of moisl processes in a 
planet's climate might be given by the ratio tre/t....., with a

4. LESSONS FROM TERRESTRIAL 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Most readers of this book wililhink of other planets when 
they hear the term ""comparative climatology."" However, 
Earth's own history. and its projected near-term future. are 
also exercises in comparativ e climatology. These have con­
siderable relevance for issues such as the limits of the habit­
able wne for exoplanets. For in-depth analysis of specific 
climate change issues we refer the reader to the chapters in 
this volume by Covey et aJ. (greenhouse effect and feed­
backs). Zem (orbital variability effects), Harder and Woods 
(solar variability effects). and lian et al. (climate evolution). 
In this section we instead consider what we have and have 
not yetleamed about Earth in panicular. and climate change 
processes in genera), from studying past and future climates. 
The most relevant climate change topic for a planetary 
audience is the sensitivity of Earth's climate to eltternal 
forcings. The only way for the global climate 10 change 
is via an imbalance between absorbed SW radialion (Q) 
and outgoing LW radialion (F). From equation (I), this can 
only be initiated by a change in solar (or stellar) luminosity, 
changing SQ: a forced change in planetary albedo A (due to a 
volcanic eruption. aerosol emissions, deforestation. elc.): or 
a change in greenhouse gas concentrations (which changes 
the LW opacity and Ihus moves lhe emission-Io-space level 
to a different altitude, temporaril y changing TJ. For lhe pur­
pose of evaluating habitable zone limits for eltoplanels, Ihe 
samc thing is accompli shed by changing d in equation (I) 
(e.g .. Abe et al., 2011). Once a climate change is externally 
forced. inlemal feedbacks (see Covey el al .. this volume) 
further alter A and T~ as the system tries 10 equilibrate. For a 
gradual climate perturbation such as anthropogenic emission 
of greenhouse gases, the most rapid response is a cooling of 
the stratosphere, which is approximatcly in radiative equilib­
rium. followed shortly by warming of the troposphere and 
land surface (Hansell et al .. 2005). Tropopau se height and 
emission level rise, but since the troposphere has wamled, 
Tc at the new higher emission levcl is not very different from that before the onset of the c1imale change. Thus. 
as mentioned in section 2, tOOay's climate is only out of 
balance by -0.6 W/m2. The surface temperatu re warms as 
the deeper troposphere convectively adjusts on the longer 
timescales associated with the thermal inertia of the ocean 
and climate feedback s (Hallsell et a/., 1985). 
Historically an idealized ""equilibrium climate sensitiv­
ity"" has been estimated in GCMs by instantaneously dou­
bling the concentration of CO2 (""2xC02 "") in an atmospheric 
GCM coupled to a Q-ftUlt ocean. This decreases F because 
the more opaque atmosphere radiates to space from a higher 
colder altitude. causing an imbalance Q > F that causes the 
planet to warm. When the climate equilibrat es and Q = F 
once again, the resulting surface tempcmtur e change aTs 
is referred to as the equilibrium climate sensitivity. In the 
current generation of GCMs being run for the fifth Coupled 
MOOellntercompari son Project (CMIP5). a different way of 
estimating climate sensitivity is being employed that uses a 
regression based on the transient climate change of a fully 
coupled atmosphere-ocean model, which sometimes gives 
a different result. 
4_1. Is the Past Prologue? 
Unlike numerical weather prediction models, whose 
short-term weather forecasts are evaluated every day, we 
have no simple way to define observational meuies that are 
useful as indicators of the fidelity of climate change projec­
tions. Such metrics have been proposed (e.g., Reichler and 
Kim, 2008) but tend to be based on available datasets rather 
than a consideration of the factors that maner most to climate 
changc. Even TOA radiative fluxes, which arc ultimately 
the source of climate change, are useless as climate change 
metrics when only their current climate mean state is uti­
lized (Pincus et 01., 2008: Collins et al .. 20 II; Klocke el al .. 
2011). Most previous studies have used .ftatic metrics such 
as monthly geographical distributions of climate parameters. 
as opposed to IJrocess-based melric.f. which measure how 
some important aspect of the climate changes with time or 
as a function of some independ ent controlling parameter. 
One possible way to constrain climate sensitivity is to 
use the changes that have occurred in Earth's past. Eanh has 
experienced multiple cold (glacial) and warm (interglacial) 
periods in its history, which in principle can provide useful 
infonnation . Some of the more dmmatic possible climate 
changes occurred in the distant past. e.g .. the hypothesi7..ed 
(and debated) snowball Earth episodes of the Neoproterozoic 
Era (1000-542 Ma) (Soli I and Cllandler, 2007: Abbot et al .. 
2012), which are relevant to the issue of the outer edge ofthc 
habitable zone. The paleoclimatic evidence for such distant 
epochs. however, is sparse. More recent periods such as 
the mid-Holocene (6 ka) are bellcr document ed but involve 
small «I°e) climate changes that make them less useful 
for insights into the future (Hargreaves and Alillall, 2(X)9). 
The epoch with the best combination of extensive docu­
mentation and a large magnitude of climate change is the 
Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (21 ka). It has often been lkl Gr""iQ; Physicul Proctssrs CQ""uolti""s Earrh""s Cfimlllr 13 
assumed that the LGM. and earlier glacials and interglacials 
associated with the Milankovitch cycles of orbital variations 
(see Zent. this volume), can be used to infer the sensitivity 
of a future warmed climate. One problem with this as­
sumption is that the LGM climate is less welJ known than 
is needed to provide a simple constraint. Early attempts to 
simulate the LGM with GCMs used prescribed sea surface 
temperature (SSn anomalies derived from ocean proxies by 
the CLIMAP Project (see Rind. 2008). The CLlMAP SSTs 
had some unusual features. such as a mid-Pacific wamling 
signal and only a small tropical ocean cooling signal of 
_1.5°C. despite woe cooling at high latitudes and sig­
nificant cooling based on different proxies in tropical land 
areas. These results implied a fairly low climate sensitivity. 
and multiple GCMs could not reproduce them. More recent 
LGM reconstructions (Waelbroeck el 01 .. 2(X)9) have used 
multiple proxies instead, finding larger tropical cooling 
that implies a higher climate sensitivity. Today's GCMs 
do not use the proxy data directly but rather run coupled 
atmosphere-ocean models and use the reconstructions 
for evaluation. Nonetheless. some glaring inconsistencies 
between the models and the data remain. calling the inter­
pretation of the prolties into question (Brady el al .. 2013). 
The second problem with the LGM as a proxy for fu­
ture climate sensitivity is that GCMs provide conflicting 
results. Crucifix (2006) found that four GCMs that spanned 
almost the full range of 6Ts uncertainty for a doubling of 
COl concentration also simulated almost identical climate 
sensitivities to each other in response to LGM climate forc­
ings (Fig. 12). The discrepancies were mainly allribl.lled to 
cloud feedbacks that changed sign between the colder and 
warmer climates in some of the models. This should not be 
a surprise given the nonlinearity of the climate system. Ye 
el al. (1998). for example. showed that convective available 
potential energy. which affects moist convection, varies dif­
ferently in response to +2 and --:zoC SST changes. because 
in the wanner climate. the current balance between con­
vective heating and radiative COOling just intensifies, while 
in the cooler climate, convection decreases dramatically, 
yielding to the large-scale dynamic s as the process that 
balances radiative cooling to first order. Hargreaves et al. 
(2012) have suggested that LGM tropical cooling is a good 
indicator of equilibrium climate sensitivity based on a larger 
ensemble of GCMs. but this test has not yel been applied 
to future climate change predictions, and inferences drawn 
from it are still subject to uncenainties in the interpretati on 
of the observational proxies. 
The message is nOI Ihat past climates are useless as con­
straints on future climate_ but rather that cont.inued thought 
must be given to how we can best use what we know about 
them to differentiate responses that are robust to the type 
of climate change examined from those that arc sensitive 
to different types of climate change or to uncertainties in 
the observations themselves. Schmidt el al. (2013) propose 
several useful strategies for doing this. 
The most commonly used ""metric"" of the past for 
demonstraling the realism of climate models is the global 14 Compamriw I ClinUlloiogy ofTerrtSlri al Planl'IS 
warming that has occurred over the twentieth century. Older 
generations of climate GeMs generally matched the twen­
tieth century warming quite well. However. Kiehl (2007) 
showed that they did this despite a wide variety of climate 
forcings and climate sensitivities (within the observational 
uncertainties) because the forcings and sensitivi ties were 
negatively correlated. For example, a model with more 
aerosol cooling might also havc a highcr sensitivity to CO2, 
The current CMIP5 generation of models does not show this 
behavior (Forster el al., 2013) (Fig. 13), although a subset 
of the models that agrees best with the observed temperature 
trend does, perhaps because most current models now try to 
include the very uncertain aerosol indirect effect on clouds. 
This causes some models to depart from the observed trend 
to an extent not seen in older models. Observations arc 
not yet good enough to tell us the correct combination of 
forcing and feedback. hence we cannot use the twentieth 
century temperature record to ""validate"" climate models. On 
the other hand. no GCM with only natural climate forcings 
has ever been able to reproduce the observed warming: this 
is perhaps the best evidence we have that the warming of 
recent decades is due to anthropogenic influences (Knutli, 
2008). In this sense today's climate models are ""wrong but 
useful"" (Schmidt. 2009). 
A caveat to the statements above is the chaotic nature 
of the climate system. Weather forecasts are sensitive to

unresolved processes such as moist convection and thus 
must be considered probabili stic (Slillgo alld Palmer. 20 II). 
One can then ask 10 what extent long-term climate change 
is predictable. Loren? (1968) considered a possible ""almost 
intransitive"" climate system whose statistics were insensi­
live to initial condilions on infinite timescales but sensitive 
to initial conditions over long but finite time intervals. 
Hasselmllllll (1976) showed how shon-term weather aCIS 
as a stochastic forcing whose effect is integrated by slow 
components of the climate system (e.g .. the upper oce:m) 
to produce longer timescale variations in sea surface tem­
peratures. The twentieth century climate appears to have 
unforced decadal variations. perhaps due to episodes of deep 
ocean heat storage (and littlc surface wamling) aliemating 
with episodes of greater near-surface warming . To date. 
however. ensemble climate model integration s over many 
centuries do nOi exhibit the longer-term, larger-amplitude 
natural variability required for the twentieth century to be 
explained as the behavior of an almost intransitive system. 
Uncertainty in future climate projection s is dominated in­
stead by uncertainty in model physics (Sliligo ami Palmer. 
20 II). as we discuss next. 
4.2. How Well Can We Project Future 
Climate Warming? 
Climate GCMs have been used to project future climate 
change for four decades. but the uncenainty in the 2C02 
aTs has not changed much. A doubling of CO2 concentra­
tion by itself wanns the surface temperature by _1.2°C. yet 
for much of the history of climate modeling, the 2xC02 
aT, of different climate models has ranged from _1.5° to 
4.5°C. The reason for the difference is fcedbacks that either 
amplify (positive feedback) or mitigate (negative feedback) 
the original CO2-forced climate change (see Covey et al.. 
this volume. for a detailed discussion). Briefly, the primary 
feedback s and their sign are the Planck feedback due to 
increased emission to space from a warmer atmosphere 
(negalive): the water vapor feedback due to the greenhouse 
effect of the waler vapor added by evaporatio n from a 
warmer surface (positive): the lapse rate feedback due pri­
marily to the lemperature dependence of the moist adiabmic 
lapse rate, which increases warming at altitude at the ex­
pense of that at the surface (negative): the snow/ice-albedo 
feedback from the decrease in planetary albedo caused by 
melting snow and sea ice as climate warms (positive); and 
the cloud feedback due to changes in cloud cover, height. 
and optical thickness. 
QUllntitative differencc-'i exist among models in the Planck, 
water vapor. lapse rate. and snow/ice-albedo feedbacks 
(Fig. 14). but their sign is not in doubt. Most of the spread 
in aT, comes from uncertainty in the sign and magnitude 
of the cloud feedback. II is often claimed that as climate 
warms, more water evaporates from the oceans, making 
more cloud. which reflects more sunlight. a negative feed­
back. BUI clouds do not depend on the mixing ralio of water vapor (which changes dramatically with temperatur e, given 
the Clausius-Clapeyro n equation) but rather the relative 
humidity (the mixing ratio relative to its saturation value), 
static stability, and other environmental factors. which do 
not obviously vary with warming in a direction that would 
either increase or decrease cloud. Furthermore , clouds at dif­
ferent altitudes have radiative effects of opposite sign. Low 
stratocumulus clouds. which reflect considerable sunlight 
but have little effect on outgoing LW radiation (Fig. 3), 
cool the planet. so increasing/decreasing them would be 
a negative/positive feedback. Cirrus clouds. on the other 
hand. are thinner and reflect less sunlight. but lie above 
the clear sky emission to space level and thus reduce LW 
emission to space, so increasing/decreasi ng them would be 
a positive/negative feedback. Changes in cloud height and 
optical thickness contribute to the cloud feedback as well, 
more so for some cloud types in some places than others. 
This makes representin g cloud effects in one-dimensional 
models of exoplanet habitable zones (Kitzman et ai., 2010; 
Zsom et aJ., 2012) a tremendous challenge. 
For the CMlP3 generation of climate models, cloud feed­
back as evaluated by the climate change in cloud forcing 
varied from negative to near-neutral to jXlsitive. according to 
Soden et aJ. (2008) (Fig. 14). consistent with the canonical 
wisdom that we do not know the sign of cloud feedback. 
Soden and Heid (2006), however. note that the cloud forc­
ing method of calculating feedback is biased because the 
cloud effect on mdiation is differenced against the clear sky 
mdiative fluxes, which also change as the climate changes. 
By calculating ""radiative kemels"" that represent the partial 
derivatives of TO A fluxes with respect to different feedback

parameters , they derive an adjusted cloud forcing change 
that is a more accurate depiction of the cloud feedback. 
Determined in this way, all the CMIP3 models have either 
a ncar-neutral or positive cloud feedback (Fig. 14), the op­
posite of the canonical wisdom. FurthemlOre, the range of 
CMIP3 climate sensitivities is 2.lc--4.4°C, i.e., the lowest 
sensitivities are no longer being simulated by any model. 
Early indications from the current eMIP5 GeMs are 
that the situation has not changed dmmatically, but now the 
sources of the net positive cloud feedback are being under­
stood (Zelinka et ai .. 2013): a positive LW cloud feedback 
due to an upward shift in the altitude of high clouds. and a 
jXlsitive SW feedback due to a decrease in total cloudiness 
outside the polar regions. The former is a robust consequence 
of the deepening of convection as the surface warms. The 
latter is a combination of two effects: a poleward shift of 
the stonn tracks as the Hadley cell expands, also a robust 
result, and a decrease in low-latitude stratocumulu s and shal­
low cumulus cloud cover, which may be understood (Brient 
and Bony, 2012) but is not thought to be reliably simulated 
by GeMs with coarse vertical resolution. At high latitudes, 
cloud optical thickness tends to increase with warming, a 
negative feedback. The response of climate model clouds to 
warming can be summarized as an ""upward and outward"" 
shift of clouds from the tropical lower troposphere to higher

proach one can identify which parameters have the greatest 
effect on the model's sensitivity. Analysis of this ensemble 
suggests that .6.Ts (in the context of one particular GeM) is 
most sensitive to assumptions about the rate of entrainment 
of dry air into convective updrafts, the fall speed of ice 
crystals, and paramete rs that affect the formation of clouds 
and precipitation (Sanderson el al.. 2010). 
The climate sensitivities simulated by today's GeMs 
incorporate only ""fast"" feedback s due to atmospheric 
or near-surface processes. On longer timescales. ""slow"" 
feedbacks due 10 continental ice sheet growth and retreat, 
vegetation changes, and carbon fluxes into and out of the 
atmosphere, soil, biosphere, and ocean can produce an 
""Earth system sensitivity"" quite different from the climate 
sensitivity due to fast feedbacks. Estimates of this sensitiv­
ity suggest that it could be 50-100% larger than the _3°e 
median fast feedback sensitivity (Lulll el al., 2010; Park 
and Royer. 2011). Furthermore, even for the fast feedbacks. 
climate sensitivity is expected to depend on atmospheric 
state. Thus it may vary from that portrayed by the CMIP5 
models when larger climate excursions are considered and 
thresholds for qualitatively different behaviors of climate 
system components are crossed (Hansen el al .. 2013). 
The apparent preponderance of positive feedbacks in the 
Earth system thus makes continued future warming highly 
probable. Furthermore, with the caveat that exoplanet sci­
ence considers variations much larger and nonlinear than 
those discussed here, what we know about Earth also may 
have implications for assessmen ts of the habitable zone of 
Earth-like planets: 
I. Ocean heat transport, which retards the sea ice growth 
(Fig. 7) and tropicaVpolar heating imbalance that helps 
determine habitable zone limits, but which is missing from 
most exoplanet mooels (e.g., Abe el al. 2011), may broaden 
the habitable zone. 
2. The negative net cloud forcing of Earth's climate 
(Fig. 3) may shift the habitable zone inward relative to 
estimates that use a cloud-free atmosphere (KopparaplI el 
al., 2013). 
3. The likelihood that many fast and slow feedbacks 
on Earth are positive offsets some part of the ocean-and 
cloud-forcing impacts. and would shrink the habitable zone. 5. CONCLUS IONS 
Much remains to be beuer understood about Eanh's cli· 
mate: how convection interacts with the general circulation 
in different dynamic and thermooynami c environments; how 
aerosols, radialion, and clouds interact with turbulence to 
determine the presence or absence of marine stratocumul us 
clouds; how stratospheric circulations affect the troposphere; 
how stable continental ice sheets are to penurbations; and so 
on. Even when we understand the basic physics. we are not 
yet able to always ponray it properly in GeMs that do not 
resolve the processes, and this limits our predictive ability. 
Nonetheless, our accumulated knowledge about Earth can 
serve as a valuable resource for solar system and exoplanet 
atmospheric scientists. For exoplanets. inferences are limited 
by our inability to resolve spatial details of observed plan­
ets. Thus. one might observe Eanh remotely as if it were 
an exoplanet (Kam/idi et al .. 2012), not to learn anything 
new about Earth, but to use our detailed knowledge of its 
spatially varying radiative properties to understand how best 
to interpret a disk-integrated exoplanet spectrum. Likewise, 
a chronic sampling problem plagues solar system science 
because missions visit specific planets only occasionally 
and often do not monitor them globally and continuously. Is 
the composition and thermodynami c structure observed by 
a single planetary probe typical of the global mean? Do dif­
ferences between snapshots of a planet taken by a past flyby 
and a current orbiter indicate a climate change or random 
samples of natural variability? Our sparse observatio ns of 
other planets might be placed into an appropriate context by 
sampling Earth satellite datasets or reanalyses in a similar 
way and asking how representative those samples are of 
conditions elsewhere or al other limes. 
More importantly. our understanding of the mechanisms 
that conspire to produce Earth's weather and climate should 
probably be used as the starting point for trying to interpret 
any new observation of another planet. Often Earth is a 
valuable guide to the physics operating on other terrestrial 
planets: baroclinic waves on Mars, deep moist convection 
on Titan, photochemica l sulfuric acid aerosols on Venus. 
When this is not the case, asking why not brings deeper 
insights than considering either planet in isolation. The 
same applies in the opposite direction: The terrestrial at­
mospheric community would benefit greatly from thinking 
more often about other planets and testing the depth of their 
understanding by bringing it to a different part of parameter 
space. Such a planetary perspective on our own planet will 
help us identify the fundamental unanswered questions that 
will advance the science the furthest.

Abstract  
 
Curation is traditionally defined as the process of collecting and organizing information 
around a common subject matter or a topic of interest and typically occurs in museums, 
art galleries, and libraries.  The task of organizing data around specific topi cs or themes 
is a vibrant and growing effort in the biological sciences but to date this effort has not 
been actively pursued in the Earth sciences.  In this paper, we introduce the concept of 
geocuration and define it as the act of searching, selecting, an d synthesizing Earth 
science data/metadata and information from across disciplines and repositories into a 
single, cohesive, and useful compendium  We present the Climate Data Initiative (CDI) 
project  as an exemplar example. The CDI project is a systematic effort to manually curate 
and share openly available climate data from various federal agencies. CDI is a broad 
multi -agency effort of the U.S. government and seeks to leverage the extensive existing 
federal climate -relevant data to stimulate innovation and private -sector entrepreneurship 
to support national climate -change preparedness.  We describe  the geocuration process 
used  in CDI project , lessons learned, and suggestions to improve similar geocurat ion 
efforts  in the future.  
 
 
1.Introduction  
 
The definition of curation can vary depending on one’s perspective. Curation is 
traditionally  defined as the process of collecting and organizing information around a 
common subject matter or a topic of interest  and typically  occurs in museums, art 2 
galleries, and libraries. In the library community, t he curation  process  has become more 
nuanced  with the advent of digital content . The digital l ibrary community define s curation 
as “actions people take to maintain an d add value to digital information over its lifecycle, 
including the processes used when creating digital content”  (Walters, 2011).  Similarly, 
Lord et al . (2004) define curation as the “activity of managing and promoting the use of 
data from its point of creation, to ensure it is fit for contemporary purpose, and available”. 
A cornerstone  component of this curation activity is archiving , where by selected  digital 
resource s are stored and made accessible  for future use .  
 
Like the library community, the Earth s cience data communities  also perform  curation  
activities  but under the broader umbrella of data stewardship (Peng et al. 2015) . These 
data stewardship activiti es support the data life cycle  by enabling data preservation , 
accessibility, usability, and sustainability, thereby ensuring quality and reproducibility.  The 
task of organizing data around specific topics or themes is a vibrant and growing effort in 
the bi ological sciences (Howe and Yon, 2008) but to date this effort has not been actively 
pursued in the Earth sciences.  One reason for this  activity gap  is that most Earth science 
repositories have mission statements  centered on broad science objectives to sup port a 
defined set of science stakeholders  [around field campaigns, observation platforms and 
missons] . The types of data ingested, archived, published , and distributed must adhere 
to these guidelines. NASA’s Earth Science Data Active Archive Centers (DAACs) are a 
good example of distributed science repositories  (Kobler and Berbert, 1991) ; with each 
DAAC ’s data holdings focused  on specific  science themes. The data within each 
repository is aggregated around science projects/missions, instruments or science 
keywords, and is presented to the user community  using  this same organization al

 There are rapidly emerging causes  that drive t he need for a finer -grained curati on of data 
and information within Earth science . First, there has been a rapid increase in the growth 
of the number of Earth science datasets and publications. For example, there are over 
14,600 Earth science related data collections (not individual files)  available in the 3 
Data.gov catalog (Wright, 2014) from various U.S. federal agencies1. A recent search on 
Elsevier’s journals related to Earth science produced a result of over 40,000 papers 
published in 2014 alone.   Second, t he study of Earth as a system  has revealed that a 
specialized focus on one facet of the system does not necessarily capture the dynamics 
of an interdependent system.  Accordingly, research within Earth science has become 
exceedingly interdisciplinary. This interdisciplinary nature of research requires discovery 
of both data and information from distributed, multiple domain data and publication 
repositories.   
 
In this paper, we introduce the concept of geocuration  and present  the Climate Data 
Initiative (CDI) project  (CDI, 2014)  as an exemplar example. The CDI project is  a 
systematic effort to manually curate and share openly  available climate data from various  
federal agencies. CDI is a broad multi -agency effort of the U.S. government  which  seeks 
to leverage ‘extensive federal c limate -relevant data to stimulate innovation and private -
sector entrepreneurship in support of national climate -change preparedness.’ (Climate 
Action Plan). CDI utilizes Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from different federal agencies 
to manually curate data around key Climate resiliency themes.  CDI exemplifies the need 
for geocuration given both the complexity of the topic and the types of relevant data 
available from different federal agencies for climate change. The subsequent sections  
describe  geocuration , the Climate Data Initiative project, the geocuration process used, 
lessons learned, and suggestions to improve future geocuration efforts.  
 
2.Geocuration  
Geocuration is the act of searching, selecting, and synthesizing Earth science 
data/metadata  and information from across disciplines and repositories  into a single, 
cohesive , and useful  compendium . Geocuration is analogous to the concept of 
verticalization in tool development , where verticalization refers to the customization of a 
tool (Kohavi  et al. 2002)  based on a specific science use or domain application. 
                                                 
1 This number does not include other useful publicly available datasets distributed by research 
laboratories, universities and other organizations.  4 
Geocuration serves the same purpose by searching, selecting , and synthesizing data and 
information based on specific science needs.  
 
Geocuration requires following several systematic step s, each of which serves  a specific 
purpose .  The Search  step is guided by the cumulative domain expertise of the curators . 
The domain experts utilize the collective domain knowledge to identify all possible 
relevant data and information resources.  Informa tion resource s could include citations 
for relevant literature, specific workflows, tools, web sites, reports , and documents. The 
Selection  step entails culling the search results based on some “fitness or relevancy” 
criteria. The fitness criteria can range from simple spatial temporal bounds  and resolution , 
a set of framing questions that define the contextual narrative around the curation e ffort 
or fully described use cases . Performing a literature review and identifying relevant data 
in published journal articles (Karasti et al.  2006 ) is another approach for selection. Finally, 
targeting  the needs of  the intended consumers of the curated compendium  is another  
effective way to filter identified information and to determine what needs to be provided 
by the curation  (Goble et al.  2008 ).  
 
Once  the selection  step is complete, the identified data and other information is 
synthesized  into a cohe sive compendium . The goal of synthesis is to address a set of 
questions. What has been gathered? A re all the data and information pieces easily 
identifiable and their associations understandable? Why are these  data and information 
pieces important to the t opic? The synthesis should provide  contextual framework for all 
the gathered information objects. How can this  information unit  be used? The consumers 
of the compendium should  be able to use the information  in his or hers  own research or 
application s with minimal  effort.  
The synthesized information can contain data virtually or locally with different level of 
granularity.  Local d ata can be aggregated as data bundles containing individual data 
granules or files. Data can also be aggregated as a single new product or a file containing 
curated data parameters from different data sets.  Using metadata, one can create Virtual 
Collections where the synthesized  compendium contain s only links to the data to its actual 
data repository for access and use.  Virtual co llections can also have different levels of 5 
granularity and can contain individual data files or specific data parameters.  The ability to 
create virtual collections using the existing rich metadata catalogs in Earth science offers 
a promising potential for  enhancing data access and use.  
 
There are two approaches to geocuration: manual curation and automated curation. 
Manual Curation requires Subject Matter Experts to serve as digital librarians, or 
geocurators,  who discover and synthesize data and informat ion virtually. One of the main 
advantages of manual curation is accuracy and trustworthiness  to address “suitability of 
purpose” . This is a key requirement for downstream consumers of this curated 
information, especially in Earth Science.  Peng et al., (2015) addresses this by asserting 
that “...users are asking for data to be dependable in terms of quality and production 
sustainability, to be from credible, secure, and authoritative sources, to be easily and 
publicly accessible online.” Manual Curation , however , is labor intensive and  “a non -
trivial undertaking that needs to balance content coverage against content quality” (Goble  
et al. 2008) . Moreover, to be effective, curation needs to become  a community activity 
promoting “collaboration where sheer scale of effort needed can deliver both breadth and 
economies of scale not possible for each singular participant”  [Macdonald, 6]. 
Community -driven curation can also provide the editorial oversight to minimize any biases 
that may occur based on an individ ual curator’s preferences. One example of successful 
manual curation is described by Howe and Yon (2008)  as “biocuration,” a topic within the 
Biomedical field, focusing on the activity of organizing, representing and making biological 
information accessibl e and usable for specific specialized sub -themes. Biocuration 
facilitates community -based curation to address the existing gaps in knowledge, provides 
researchers with a means to quickly find and use massive  amounts of complex data 
quickly, offers insights  concerning  specific areas of interest , and makes it possible to 
process  information faster as data and information is synthesized as part of curation. 
Extracting, tagging with control vocabularies, and representing data from published 
literature are the c ore tasks within biocuration.  
 
Curation is still difficult to achieve in a fully automated manner. There are different 
approaches and tools that support topic or theme -based searches using text mining or 6 
ontological based algorithms (Shamsfard et al. 2006 ; Yue et al. 2009; Liu 2010) . These 
approaches by themselves are not enough but can be used as tools to filter down 
resources that are then manually re -ranked and synthesized  (Alex et al. 2008) . These 
tools can support searches across domains and provide a utomated mediation between 
different vocabularies used in different repositories to represent similar data  (Klien et al. 
2001) . An example of an automated curation prototype is the “Data Albums” described in 
Ramachandran et al (2014).  Data Albums are compiled virtual collections of information 
related to a specific science topic or an event, containing links to relevant data files 
(granules) from different instruments as well as tools and services for visualization and 
analysis and inf ormation about the event contained in news reports, images, or videos to 
supplement research analysis.  Curation is achieved via an ontology -based relevancy 
ranking algorithm that filters out non -relevant information and data.  We envision in the  
near future, specialized relevancy ranking algorithms will be able to generate virtual 
collections for  defined curation tasks.  
 
 
3.Climate Data Initiative  Project Overview  
 
The President’s Climate Action Plan and the Executive Order 136532, Preparing the 
United Sta tes for the Impacts of Climate Change, call for the Federal Government to 
“…develop and provide authoritative, easily accessible, usable, and timely data, 
information, and decision -support tools on climate preparedness and resilience” to 
support federal, r egional, state, local, tribal, private -sector and nonprofit -sector efforts to 
prepare for the impacts of climate change. In response to this call, NASA and NOAA were 
asked to lead the Climate Data Initiative (CDI) and development of a Climate Resilience 
Toolkit (CRT) , respectively .  
The Climate Data Initiative (CDI) focuses on preparing  the United States for the impacts 
of climate change by leveraging “extensive federal climate -relevant data to stimulate 
                                                 
2 http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR -2013 -11-06/pdf/2013 -26785.pdf  7 
innovation and private -sector entrepreneurship in sup port of national climate -change 
preparedness .” (President’s Climate Plan, 16). It also supports the broader Open Data 
Policy and integrates this effort with other Open Data Initiatives  by adding the new 
Climate.Data.gov which includes  an online catalog of datasets and data products. The 
Climate Data Initiative is a collaborative effort across federal agencies and scientific 
disciplines that seeks to make federal climate data both usable and accessible for its 
defined stakeholders.   So far, t he CDI and CRT include  seven themes, or topics, relevant 
to climate change resiliency. These themes include Coastal Flooding, Food Resilience, 
Water, Ecosystem Vulnerability, Human Health, Energy Infrastructure, and 
Transportation. Each theme is a curated virtual data collection that is  relevant to 
addressing the challenges of climate resiliency as it relates to a specific aspect of the 
Earth system and the resulting societal impacts.   
 
Since knowing for whom curation is intended can serve as guide for what curation to 
provide (Goble et al.  2008 ), the Climate Data Initiative defined its stakeholders to include 
decision makers and innovators. Decision makers are individuals responsible for shaping 
policy, legislation, finances, social programs, funding , and disaster plannin g at the 
national, state, and local levels. These decision makers include policy makers and 
planners who need to analyze data related to activities that are essential to planning for 
climate change resiliency. A key need  for decision makers such as GIS ana lysts, 
emergency management responders, and natural resource managers is accessible, 
ready to use data in  formats  or standard APIs  supported by  a decision support system. 
Example formats range from KMLs  and ESRI’s shapefiles  to geoTIFFs which  can be 
easily  used in  Geographic Information Systems .  
The CDI is  focused on stimulating innovation , and entrepreneurship,  among data 
innovators in the private sector and the general public who will use data to create and 
build inform ation  and applications  for end use rs. Data i nnovators  are public and private 
sector software developers that wish to develop new applications that leverage the federal 
government’s openly available climate data. Recognizing that some of the best ideas for 8 
government come from outside the g overnment, CDI targeted innovators to stimulate the 
growth of innovative websites, innovat ive new apps, and other creative  tools around the 
various climate resiliency themes.  
 
 
4.CDI Curation Process  
 
The three components of the CDI project are : the data system  infrastructure su pporting 
the project, curation team consisting of Subject Matter Experts (SME) and informatics 
experts, and the curation p rocess  itself. Fig 1 provides a bird 's-eye view of the CDI 
curation  process and its components.  
 
9 
Figure 1: Ov erview of the CDI Curation process, participants based on roles and 
infrastructure components used to publish the final results.  
 
Curation  Infrastructure  
To curate a  virtual  data collection that includes information about data from various 
agencies across the Federal government, a  catalog is required to hold all the metadata 
in a single repository or location. All federal agencies are mandated to publish metadata 
for their da tasets in the Data.gov ( US EOP -OMB, 2009 ) catalog. Therefore, the Data.gov 
catalog was the natural choice to serve as the core infrastructure component for the CDI  
interagency curation effort.  
 
The underlying Data.gov catalog [and its sister site, Geoplatf orm.gov,] use the 
Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN) (Wainwright, 2012) data 
management system  . CKAN  is a widely used data management system which  make s 
data discoverable and accessible . It provides  tools to streamline  publishing , sharing,  
finding, and using  data. Data publishers  use CKAN  to create a ca talog  that both describes 
and makes the data discoverable.  Data.gov supports CKAN’s open source nature by 
adding new functionality  and customizations as well as repairing CKAN -related bugs. 
CKAN also provides a RESTful API to  programmatically  query its catalog, generate 
statistics, and list datasets by theme.  
 
There are two main types of metadata in Data.gov: geospatial and non -geospatial. All 
non-geospatial metadata must comply with the Project O pen Data (POD) metadata 
schema. The POD metadata schema is based on Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) and  
requires JavaScript Object Notation  (JSON ) format encoding for its records . All  agencies 
provide metad ata in POD -compliant JSON files.  These metadata re cords are harvested  
daily. Validation for schema conformance is performed  during the harvest process before 
the metadata is  ingested and published in the data.gov catalog .  10 
 
For describing geospatial  datasets , the Data.gov catalog  supports two types of geo spatial 
metadata standards: ISO -19115:2003   and the Federal Geographic Data Committee’s 
Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (FGDC CSDGM). Geospatial metadata 
is typically provided in  a Catalog Service for the Web (CSW) endpoint. A mapping , 
implemented by a crosswalk,  is required to  transform  geospatial metadata to the native 
Data.gov Project Open Data schema. The crosswalk map s the ISO 19115:2003 metadata 
into the POD schema. The CSDGM/FGDC metadata is first mapped into the ISO 
19115:2003 schema  and then subsequently transformed into the POD schema  using this 
same crosswalk . 
 
Curation Team  
For CDI, geocuration is a manual activity completed by two teams – the theme team and 
the data coordination team . The t heme team  consists  of subject matt er experts from 
multiple agencies. The theme team is  responsible for  recomm ending  sources of 
authoritative data relevant for a particular climate resilience topic . Each theme team is 
assigned a team lead and a Technical Point of Contact. The role of the Technical Point 
of Contact is to liaison with and assist t he Data Coordination team in interacting with 
different federal agencies in the course of adding  missing data to the Data.gov catalog or 
correct ing any metadata issues identified. The Data Coordinat ion team consists of  Earth 
Science informatics experts with the primary responsibility to check catalog metadata 
quality , identify problem datasets , suggest ways to different agencies to  improve 
metadata quality  and t rack metrics on data accessibility and  usability .  
 
Curation  Process  
 
Data must meet three criteria to be added  to a CDI Compendium  – in this case, a specific  
climate resiliency  theme . First, a curated dataset should be scientifically relevant to the 
given climate resiliency topic . The subject matter experts on the theme team ensure that 11 
the selected datasets meet this scientific criterion. Second, the  curated dataset must be 
from a reputable source , preferably from a federal agency  [ in this phase the focus is on 
federal data reso urces or data produced under sponsorship of a federal agency] . Third, 
a curated dataset must be accessible and usable. The data coordination team, with 
assistance from the theme team and the original data providers , is primarily responsible 
for ensuring that datasets meet these criteria . 
 
The process begins with the  theme  team creating a series of framing questions to guide 
the selection of datasets that are suitable and relevant to the climate resiliency  topic. The 
theme team uses the Data.gov catalog as a  starting point for searching  the relevant data 
for curation . The theme team identifies a ny missing data and notifies the agency 
producing the data to publish the requisite metadata. The agency producing the  data is 
responsible for providing the metadata t o publish and ma ke discoverable  in the Data.gov 
catalog. After the completion of this curation phase , the theme team gives the data 
coordination team  a list of data and other ancillary information upon which to perform 
quality checks .  
 
The data coordination team  perform s quality control checks on  the metadata to verify that 
data is accessible and the associated metadata is robust enough to ensure  users can 
utilize  these datasets in their applications . The CDI project defines accessible data   as 
data that is  available in convenient and well-known  mechanisms  that can be easily  
consumed  such as machine APIs  or downloadable files in standard formats . Accessible 
data are sub-divided into data that are  directly usable by decision makers and those  more 
suitable for input to tools and applications that an innovator might develop . Accessible 
data usable by  decision makers include data formats that can be readily interoperable 
with decision support systems such as Geographic Information Systems  including  ESRI’s 
ArcGIS , and Google Earth.  Accessible data, usable by innovators include s common data 
formats that are machine -readable. Machine -readable data are reasonably structured to 12 
allow users to write code for automated processing. Machine -readab le data provide the 
most value to innovators by allow ing them  to quickly reprocess the data or obtain  the data 
automatically in order to populate applications. These types of data can also have 
application programming interfaces, or APIs, to allow innovato rs to build new tools  using 
these  datasets or to bring together information from various disparate sources.   
 
The quality assessment for all of the metadata in a curated collection is compiled in a 
document. Th is document provides feedback for each individ ual metadata record  and 
includes  all identified  issues  along with  suggestions for improving the records. The 
responsible data providers  within specific agencies  are given the feedback document. 
These quality improvements are performed in an iterative manne r. If by chance  the 
metadata corrections are not completed by an agency  at the time of the theme release, 
those datasets  are not included in the published theme collection. Since the curation  for 
each  theme  is an ongoing continuous process, improvements to the metadata records 
are made after the theme release and new metadata records can be subsequently  added 
to the collection.  
 
5.Curation Results  
 
Each theme  in CDI  is incrementally rolled out. The incremental release process for each 
theme ensures that  they are  highlighted individually. Additionally, the incremental process 
encourages users to return to the climate collection , thus creating  repeat users .  Once a 
theme is made public, the theme teams are encouraged to continue to add additiona l 
datasets to the collection. This ensures the climate themes remain fresh and relevant to 
returning users.  
The user accesses the collection through the main climate page on Data.gov at 
Data.gov/climate (Figure 2). The pages can be sorted by theme  which  result s in the  data 
collections also being listed by theme. The user can select the ‘data’ tab to obtain  the 13 
relevant data catalog listing (Figure 2). The catalog listing is then displayed in the order 
of the most recent views where ‘recent  views ’ quantifie s as the number of views within 
the last two weeks. Once the user selects a record, information about the dataset is 
displayed including the agency that provides the data, the spatial extent of the data (if 
applicable), a short summary about the dataset, a nd links to access the data (Figure 2).

in the three snapshots. The top image shows the CDI home page. Once a user selects 
a theme and the data tab, the curated datasets are presented (middle image). The 
lower image is an example of a specific data set landing page.  
  
To date, seven  themes have been released as a part of the Climate Data Initiative (Table 
1).  These themes were curated by subject matter experts from several Federal agencies, 
including NOAA, USDA, USGS, and HHS/CDC.

Table 1: Different c limate resilience themes released by CDI  
 
The Climate Data Initiative collection currently consists of 560 unique datasets  (Figure 
3). Due to some datasets being included in multiple themes, the number of datasets by 
theme appears to be higher than the total collection.

Figure 3: Number datasets curated under the CDI effort categorized by the different 
climate resilience themes.  
 
 
The CDI website was instrumented with Google Analytics on January, 2015 after four of 
the themes had been released. The numbers from  January 2015 are significant. There 
were around 47,000 unique page views  on the CDI site . About 2% of the  total visitors  
browsed the curated data.  
 
Over 700 datasets from pre -release theme team submissions were checked for quality 
by the data coordination team. Of these, 543 were made available at the theme release, 
118 are a part of themes that have not been released yet, and approximately 100 did no t 
pass the metadata quality checks at the time of release.  
 
 
 
6.Challenges  
Some of the main challenges faced  during the  CDI curation process  are described here:  
 
17 
1. Need for Discoverable, Open , and Accessible Data  
Federal agencies are mandated  to make th eir data accessible and publish metadata in  in 
Data.gov . However, more often that not,  a desired data set by the SMEs on the theme 
team  was not always readily available.  The theme teams encountered various challenges  
when requesting the desired data be added to the Data.gov catalog. These challenges 
included finding the original data producer , identifying an agency or organization’s 
individual responsible for publishing the  metadata into Data.gov, or simply educating the 
organization on the Data.gov metadata requirements. The theme teams were able to 
overcome these challenges within their own organizations ; however , reaching across 
agencies sometimes proved difficult .  
 
2. Importance of Synthesis  
The curated list  of data is unable to accurately capture the subject matter experts’ intent . 
While having a curated collection of datasets approved by subject matter experts is 
valuable, in the end the collection essentially becomes a long directory or  a list. 
Establishing valuable  connections between datasets  and their intended use  is lost in a 
list. Therefore, the user knows that the datasets in the list have been approved by the 
subject matter experts but has less certainty when making connections between the 
various datase ts and their possible applications .  
 
3. Curation is a non -trivial p rocess  
The process of data curation for CDI is complicated because of the involvement of many 
people from multiple agencies using many different infrastructure components and  short 
deadlines  for each theme release. Even though a systematic process   designed by the 
CDI data coordination team was utilized, finding and fixing errors ranging from missing 
data sets to broken URLs was an extremely labor intensive effort.  This was primarily  the 
role of the data coordination team.  As the data coordination team’s work progressed , the 
process of identification and resolution of metadata issues improved . This improvement 
was due to a better understanding of the Data.gov catalog and their harves ting processes,  
gained by collaborating with both the Data.gov team and metadata experts  from different 
agencies . This more nuanced understanding of where issues were originating from 
enabled the data coordination team to provide specific feedback to the t heme teams  and 
agencies . Overall, these targeted diagnostics increased the likelihood of metadata  
record s getting fixed  by the data producers  in time for the theme release.  18 
 
4. Metadata standards help but there are always some issues  
Data.gov uses  the POD  schema to define metadata elements to store in its catalog. 
However, Data.gov holds metadata for both geospatial and non -geospatial data.  Mapping 
geospatial metadata elements geospatial standards such as FGDC or ISO 19115  to the 
POD  schema  can often be problematic . Two types of error typically cause the mapping 
issues . First, if there are no obvious one -to-one semantic mappings  of certain elements 
between the two schemas. Second , if there are problems  in the software code  itself 
transformin g metadata records from one standard to the other.  
 
5. Curation  cannot be a one-off activity  
Curation cannot be a one -off activity especially for projects  like CDI with ambitious goal s 
and large scope. The curation process is dynamic because  the curated list change s over 
time and requires periodic monitoring. The search and selection process can drive these 
changes , allowing  the curators to discover  new relevant data sets that are then added  to 
the relevant theme or topic list . The changes can also be dri ven by other factors such as 
data sets no longer being published by the data producer, changes in the infrastructure 
causing metadata harvesting issues, metadata errors during updates ,  etc.  
 
 
Figure 4: Plot tracking the number of datasets curated under the Water theme over time 
showing the evolving nature of geocuration.  
19 
 
 
The Water  theme  report  figure (Figure 4) illustrates these arguments . The initial push of 
curation by the theme team can be seen leading up to mid -October. During this period, 
the data coordination team is also checking all submitted metadata records for 
accessibility and usability.  The decline in the number of datasets a round the beginning 
of November illustrates the process of removing all datasets that do not pass quality 
checks in preparation for the theme release. Notice that the number of associated broken 
links also decline around this time. Finally, the collection shows continued growth over 
time as the theme team continues to add new relevant datasets to the collection.  
 
7.Discussion  
 
Using subject matter experts to curate  data for  the climate resiliency  themes for the 
Climate Data Initiative was, overall, a successful endeavor . However, steps can be taken 
to improve  the curation process and resolve some of the issues listed in the section  
above . Some of the lessons learned  from this project  that can be a pplied to any similar 
curation effort in the future are:  
 
 Any successful data curation activity (both local and virtual) requires a large pool 
of open and accessible datasets that are discoverable.  Also, metadata catalog(s) 
play a critic al role in enabl ing successful data curation, especially if the curated 
data collections are virtual.     
 The r ole of synthesis in curation is often overlooked or glossed over ; however, this 
synthesis often turns out to be an important element to determine the utility of the  
curated  compendium . Selected data must be synthesized with the intent of 
curation, captured in a formal structure or information model , and presented to 
users in a meaningful manner instead of just being presented as a long list of data 
sets per topic.  
 The use of standards does not eliminate metadata issues , especially if 
transformations are required between different standards.  20 
 Curation should not be a one -off process. As long as the curated collection is 
relevant, it requires periodic updates and monitor ing to maintain both its quality 
and value to end users.  
 The c uration process can be  streamlined to encourage continued participation. 
Making the original curators  into moderators of the collection instead of just the 
primary source of content would lighte n the burden of curation (Goble et al . 2008 ).  
 There is a need to reward or incentivize the curation process. In order to encourage 
participation, a streamlined citation method for curation efforts would ensure that 
curators receive recognition for work done. Citation could also potentially 
encourage th e continued use of the curated data which could potentially contribute 
to a longer lifespan for the curated data.  
 There is a need to capture usage metrics because assessing the impact made by 
the curation effort (Howe et al.  2008 ) could persuade others of  the validity of the 
process.  
 
The methodology followed by the Climate Data Initiative of using both subject matter 
experts and data experts to curate a collection of climate -related data from across the 
federal government lends trustworthiness and reliab ility to the collection. This 
trustworthiness is essential for decision makers and innovators who wish to plan for 
climate change resiliency. Additionally, the collaborative nature of the Climate Data 
Initiative model lays the foundation for future cross -discipline curation efforts in the Earth 
sciences. The study of Earth as a system has revealed that a specialized focus on one 
facet of the system does not necessarily capture the dynamics of an interdependent 
system. The mechanisms of climate change and cl imate resiliency are similarly 
interdependent. Better synthesis of the curated data to the capture of these 
interdependent relationships is a logical step forward in the pursuit of data discoverability, 
data accessibility, and ultimately, in the case of th e Climate Data Initiative, climate 
resiliency.

 Climate research must sharpen its view Jochem Marotzke (JM), Christian Jakob (CJ), Sandrine Bony (SB) Paul A. Dirmeyer (PAD), Paul O’Gorman (PO’G), Ed Hawkins (EH), Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick (SPK), Corinne Le Quéré (CleQ), Sophie Nowicki (SN), Katsia Paulavets (KS), Sonia I. Seneviratne (SIS), Bjorn Stevens (BS), Matthias Tuma (MT)  Human activity is changing Earth's climate. Now that this has been acknowledged and accepted in international negotiations, climate research needs to define its next frontiers.   The 2015 Paris agreement1 at COP21 has liberated climate research from discussing what is already known – the world is warming and humans are largely responsible. As society aims to limit further warming by reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, climate research must probe deeper into the unknown.  Here we argue that basic climate research can sharpen its view by casting the challenges ahead into a few simple yet powerful guiding questions: First, where does the carbon go? Second, how does the weather change with climate? And third, how does climate influence the habitability of the Earth and its regions?  These questions require additional context before they can begin to guide research. “The carbon” is anthropogenic, but its input into the climate system occurs against the background of a highly dynamic and variable natural carbon cycle. “The weather” is produced by an interplay of thermodynamic and dynamic processes, which crucially determine circulation and rainfall patterns, and whose variability and future change are particularly uncertain2. “The habitability” includes those factors that societies can successfully adapt to – or cannot.  These three simple-sounding questions pose profound scientific challenges. But they do much more than that. They point to the heart of what society needs to know if it is to make informed decisions on possible responses (although not necessarily to the heart of what society is currently requesting to know about climate change). For example, for mitigation efforts to succeed, verification of the emissions reductions pledged by the individual countries in the Paris agreement1 must be based on sound scientific methods3. Changes in rainfall patterns, such as the long-term Australian rainfall decline4, are strongly linked to changes in the circulation of the atmosphere and oceans, and yet the mechanisms for such regional changes remain poorly understood5. Possible limits in societies’ ability to adapt to changes in climate, such as physiological limitations to coping with heat stress6, will first be reached on regional scales7, but where and when remains uncertain.     2 
 Where does the carbon go? How the anthropogenic carbon is processed in the climate system has crucial and poorly understood aspects both in the short and the long term. During the next few decades, the implementation of the Paris agreement will pose the question of whether individual countries fulfil their pledges toward emissions reductions and whether their self-reporting is reliable. Science-based verification of reported emissions at least on a regional scale will be essential for building confidence in the treaty regime. This need for confidence-building is reminiscent of the situation prior to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) of the early 1990s, banning all nuclear test explosions. One science challenge was to ensure that the seismic network could provide the information necessary for distinguishing suspected underground nuclear explosions from earthquakes. Advances in science and data processing led the CTBT’s verification network to be widely considered up to its task. Similarly, climate science should be ready to support any potential future verification regime for the Paris agreement3.   The scientific challenges are substantial. In principle methods exist to estimate regional anthropogenic surface carbon fluxes from local flux measurements and inverse modelling relying on ground- and space-based atmospheric concentration measurements. But identifying the anthropogenic part of changes in surface fluxes – crucial in any verification regime – is complicated by internal climate variability. For example, during an El Niño event atmospheric carbon concentration tends to be elevated, due to the dominating reduced uptake by the land surface combined with the reduced outgassing in the warmer tropical Pacific. And the ocean carbon sink, the largest contribution to which comes from the Southern Ocean, shows substantial decade-to-decade variability, probably from variability in weather patterns8 that are difficult to simulate realistically in today’s climate models.   Looking ahead toward the second half of this century, the question shifts to the magnitude of the feedback between climate and the carbon cycle. There is general agreement that the feedback is amplifying – in a warmer climate, less carbon will be taken up by the land and by the ocean, and a larger fraction of the anthropogenic carbon will remain in the atmosphere, further enhancing climate change – but the magnitude of the feedback remains uncertain. The uncertainty arises somewhat differently for the ocean sink and the land sink9. For the ocean sink the basic processes are generally known (circulation, vertical mixing, and the sinking of biological material), but not the magnitude and sometimes even the sign of the expected changes in these processes, especially the impact of ocean acidification on ecosystems. On land there is substantial uncertainty concerning the processes that determine the carbon–climate feedback. For example, there is extensive scientific debate about the importance of nutrient limitation (nitrogen and phosphorous supply) for future land carbon uptake. Additionally the land biosphere, and associated carbon cycle, relies on water availability, but the future is unclear with uncertainty in circulation and water cycle changes – a topic we turn to next. 3 
 How does the weather change with climate? Humans do not truly experience climate. Instead, individuals experience day-to-day variability – the weather. Many human and natural systems are highly sensitive to weather time scales of a few weeks or less, including high-impact weather events, such as heat waves, floods and wind-storms. Hence, the question of how the weather changes with climate is of great importance, and yet, it remains profoundly difficult to answer. Why is this so? Weather is the combined result of the atmospheric circulation embedded in the larger-scale climate structures and of local-to-regional thermodynamic processes interacting with the weather patterns. Weather arises because circulation systems respond to the differential heating from the sun by transporting energy from where it accumulates (at the surface and at low latitudes) to where it can be more effectively and efficiently radiated back to space. These circulation systems, whether the towering cumulus clouds carrying monsoon rains or the patterns of warm and cold fronts in the mid-latitudes, are highly dynamic and encompass processes that interact across a wide array of scales.  It is no wonder that attempts to link their behaviour to something as aggregated as the state of the climate are still so rudimentary.   What we have learned is that small-scale processes, which play an important role in shaping circulation responses in a changing climate, cannot be explicitly represented in the resolved equations of global weather and climate models, due to both limited understanding and inadequate computational resources. Instead, these processes must be described through their overall statistical effects – a technique known as parameterisation.  An example is atmospheric moist convection, which expresses itself in a range of well-known clouds, from fair-weather cumulus clouds to isolated thunderstorms to cloud clusters on the scale of continents.  The presence of moist convection is often associated with severe storms and extreme precipitation, its absence with heat waves and drought. And while it is well known that convection tends to organise in storms or rain belts, it remains a scientific challenge to understand what determines the strength and pattern of this organisation10.  Weather is noisy. In many regions of the Earth, day-to-day, week-to-week and year-to-year variations in the weather can be large. Just think of the passage of a cold front in the extra-tropics, in which the temperature can change by ten or more degrees centigrade in a few hours. Understanding and predicting how this internal variability (noise) influences our evolving climate and weather11, especially on the scales where society lives, is critical to inform decisions on mitigation and adaptation. Internal variability also complicates the attribution of changes in regional climate, but long-term signals are now beginning to emerge from the noise in different locations for temperature, extremes, and precipitation12. However, the attribution of shorter-timescale (decadal) signals to their causes remains in its infancy.   4 
 How does climate influence the habitability of the Earth and its regions?  Changes in the climate will shape changes in both the natural and the human environment. Of particular importance will be those changes that might exceed the limits within which particular species, including humans, can adapt 13. Prominent examples of such changes are regions of heat stress beyond the physiological limits, declining water availability, and the loss of land surface associated with rising sea levels. Climate science must therefore explore where and when habitability limits will be reached. This question is intimately linked to changes in the weather and its extremes, but goes well beyond and provides a handshake to the biological and social sciences.  There is growing evidence that heat extremes are increasing in many regions, and climate simulations consistently project further increases13. In some mid-latitude and subtropical regions, the likelihood of severe heat waves will be enhanced by feedbacks with soil drying7. In the humid tropics, unprecedented climates are expected to emerge owing to low inter-seasonal variability and are likely to cause intolerable heat-stress conditions regularly6. Forty per cent of the world’s population currently live in tropical regions, and much of their livelihood is based on outdoor labour. This is exacerbated by the fact that nations in these regions have a limited adaptive capability to adverse conditions13. Answering the critical question of when and where heat stress might exceed the physiological limits of the human body6 requires major progress in our understanding and predictive capability of local heat and moisture extremes7 in addition to a tightening of our estimates of climate sensitivity5.  The global water cycle — from the formation of clouds, to the release of precipitation, to land surface hydrology including its interaction with the atmosphere, to water storage and release in the cryosphere — remains one of the least understood natural cycles. Hence, the predictions of this cycle in a changing climate are amongst the most uncertain13. This constitutes a major challenge in ascertaining future water availability and its regional distribution for agriculture, industry and domestic use.    Even if atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations are stabilised, sea level will continue to rise for centuries; the largest uncertainty in the estimates of future global sea-level rise is due to melting ice sheets14. In addition to inundating low-lying coastal regions, sea level rise increases the severity and frequency of storm-driven and tidally driven coastal flooding14, thus threatening the habitability and productivity of large portions of the land surface.   The challenges ahead  Answering our three guiding questions requires breakthroughs in the basic understanding of how climate works. Breakthroughs cannot be planned, but their achievement can be aided by the right strategies. First and foremost, climate research must maintain the right balance between fundamental discovery and the application of its new-found knowledge to societal needs. Without a strong 5 
 fundamental-discovery basis to support this balance, climate research and hence the society at large will repeatedly be caught off guard by the multitude of surprises that the climate system presents. Consider some recent surprises – the record-breaking Arctic sea ice decline in 2007, the surface-warming slowdown of the early 21st century, the 2010 Russian heat wave and drought, the pan-Greenland surface ice melt in 2012, and the 2014/2015 El Niño that wasn’t – to appreciate the challenge they posed to understanding, but also to appreciate how a strong foundation of basic research has effected rapid progress on these challenges once they arose.  Basic research is also required to prepare humankind for unlikely but possible future surprises, caused perhaps by nonlinearities in the climate system that might compound the threat to habitability, from a combination of very large greenhouse-gas emissions and very high climate sensitivity. This type of research may not immediately provide society with better climate information, but it is crucial for building a robust knowledge base from which climate preparedness for society is drawn.    Another crucial strategy relies on having the intellectual agility to critically interrogate ideas – and their articulation in climate models – through observations. This strategy has two key ingredients, in addition to the free flow of new ideas. First, we must build the best climate models we can10. This will very likely require a substantial reduction in the grid-spacing used by the models, allowing greater reliance on the explicitly represented physical laws and less on parameterisations. Achieving this model improvement will likely benefit from a small number of international flagship programs that push the boundaries of current scientific and technological capability. It also requires improved efficiency of computer codes and a massive increase in computational resources.  The second key ingredient to interrogating our ideas comprises a sufficiently powerful combination of sustained long-term climate observations that monitor the overall trajectory of the system and its components. Highly agile and targeted observational efforts both from space and the ground are also needed to scrutinise the mechanisms that underpin major unknowns. For example, reliably measuring all components of the water cycle, from soil moisture to the extraction of water from the surface by turbulent fluxes and plants to water vapour and clouds in the atmosphere to precipitation concurrent with key quantities describing the atmospheric circulation remains a major challenge – yet one that must be met.  The research compelled here is not new; however, the guiding questions provide a new lens on the basic climate-research agenda, aiding its communication to other scientific disciplines, to the public, and to policy-makers. Many of the societal demands for climate information cannot currently be robustly met because of the lack of basic understanding.  To create this understanding and thus to effect the needed gains for society, climate researchers must mobilise to tackle the science challenges that we have outlined. The human spirit is alive in climate research, as witnessed by responses to the surprises encountered in the past, but a growing influx of the best scientific talent is needed to prepare for the surprises that are to come. 6

© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  Abstract  
The Arctic is experiencing  rapid climate change  in response to changes in greenhouse gases, 
aerosols and other climate drivers. Emission changes in general, as well as geographical  
shifts in emissions and transport pathways  of short -lived climate forcers , make it necess ary 
to understand the influence o f each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver 
Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five 
different climate drivers separately (CO 2, CH 4, the solar constant, BC and SO 4). We show that 
the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global 
mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between  climate drivers, ranging from 
1.9 (± an inter -model standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (± 0.6 ) for the SO4 
perturbations , with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers . The vertical and 
seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar 
mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For a ll drivers , the precipitation change per 
degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic , with a seasonality following that 
of the Arctic amplification . We find indications that SO 4 perturbations produce a slightly 
stronger precipitation response than the other drivers , particularly compared to CO 2. 
Key Points:  
 Arctic amplification of surface warming is similar between  global  drivers of climate 
change  
 Black carbon induces differing v ertical and seasonal amplification  patterns  
 Sulfa te affects Arctic precipitation responses more strongly  than  other drivers, 
particularly in the summer season

Both observat ions and climate models indicate that the temperature increase in the Arctic 
has been substantially larger than the globally averaged warming  since preindustrial times 
(Cowtan and Way, 2014; Hartmann et al., 2013; Holland and Bitz, 2003) . This phenomenon 
is known as Arctic amplification  (AA) . Locally, th e Arctic amplification  involves  pronounced 
reductions in sea ice cover  (AMAP, 2017; Kay et al., 2011; Notz and Stroeve, 2016) , 
increasing Arctic methane emissions from permafrost degradation (Anthony et al., 2016) , 
changes to the mass balance of glaciers and ice sheets (Shepherd et al., 2012)  and 
detrime ntal influences on Arctic ecosystems (Hinzman et al., 2013)  and indigenous 
peoples  (IPCC, 2014 ). Future changes in shipping and other anthropogenic activities in the 
Arctic  (Peter s et al., 2011)  can induce further climate  change  and health  impacts in this 
sensitive region . The strong Arctic warming  can also have far-reaching global implications  
(Zappa et al., 2018) . For instance, there are signs that  enhanced melting  of Arctic sea ice 
and glaciers  influences  the Atlantic overturning circulation  (Caesar et al., 2018; Yang et 
al., 2016) . Cohen et al. (2014)  and Coumou et al. (2018)  point out that the AA can influence 
mid-latitude weather via changes in storm tracks, the jet stream, and planetary waves and 
their associated energy propagation.  Similarly, teleconnections between the Arctic and 
the Asian continent ha ve been demonstrated through influences on the winter monsoon 
(Gong et al., 2001)  and on the frequency of unusually hard winters (Kug et al., 2015)  in 
East Asia.  
The AA is caused by local forcings  and feedbacks as well as by remote forcing, but the 
relative importance of these impacts is still debated. While previous invest igations 
commonly attributed the main cause of AA to the snow and ice albedo feedbacks (Hall, 
2004; Manabe and Stouffer, 1980) , an idealized model experiment by Alexeev et al. (2005) , 
in which the surface albedo was fixed, demonstra ted that poleward energy transport from 
lower latitudes alone could create an AA. The importance of lower -latitude impacts on the 
Arctic through transport of heat and moisture has been stressed by many studies 
(Graversen and Wang, 2009; Screen et al., 2012; Yoshimori et al., 2017) , and a  recent 
analysis  by Yoshimori et al. (2017)  found that the effect of remote forcing is predominant in 
the Arctic warming.  Other  studies report that the AA is dominated by local forcings and 
feedbacks (Stuecker et al. 2016), and point to the importance of processes such a s the water 
vapor and cloud feedbacks (Graversen and Wang, 2009)  or the lapse -rate and Planck 
feedbacks  (Pithan and Mauritsen, 2014) , in addition to the ice albedo feedback (Laîné et al., 
2016; Screen and Simmonds, 2010) . Whether or not local processes dominate, the 
possibility of an influence from forcing at lower latitudes remain. This makes the origin of 
this forcing  relevant , as h omogeneously distributed greenhouse gases and highly regional 
aerosols may influence  the AA differently .  
While several multi -model studies based on CMIP5 models have focused on the Arctic 
(Barnes and Polvani, 2015; Clara and Dirk, 2017; Franzke et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2017) , 
none have , to our knowledge , looked at different drivers independently. The Precipitation  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP) (Myhre et al., 2017)  provides a 
unique dataset  that allows  for investigations into climate responses to separate and clearly 
defined climate drivers, such as greenhouse gases or aerosols , in a multi -model framework . 
This has led the way for several studies that have investigated various aspects of climate 
driver -response  relationships from  a global perspective  (Liu et al., 2018; Samset et al., 2018; 
Samset et al. , 2016; Stjern et al., 2017) . Here we use the PDR MIP data set to analyze the 
climate response in the Arctic (defined as the region north of 60°N ). Our main object ive is to 
see whether clear differences exist with respect to how different climate drivers influence 
the Arctic . We do this by providing  descriptive accounts of how changes to precipitation and 
the Arctic amplification vary between the drivers . Our ma in focus is on experiments where 
the drivers are perturbed globally, but w e also examine the response to isolated 
perturbations of aerosols i n two  different source regions. For aerosols and other short -lived 
climate drivers, the location of emissions can be important to the subsequent impact on 
global and regional climate (Lund et al., 2014; Sand et al., 2013; Sand et al ., 2016; Screen et 
al., 2012; Shindell et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2018) . Wobus et al. (2016)  find that different 
future emission scenarios produce large variations in the resulting Arctic temperature 
change . Hence, as future changes in emissions and transport pathways (Jiao and Flanner, 
2016)  may shift the role of drivers, and their sources, in Arctic climate change , quantifying 
regional depe ndence of the forcing and response relationship is important . Combined, t his 
will improve our understanding of the processes governing Arctic climate change today and 
allow us to make more informed predictions for future changes under various emission 
path way scenario s. 
The next  section gives an account of the data and methodology used in the present 
analyses. Section 3 shows spatially and temporally resolved Arctic temperature respon ses to 
global perturbations of five climate drivers , including a quantification of  the slow 
temperature -driven feedback response . A similar account of precipitation responses is given 
in Section 4, including a n energy budget analysis of differences between drivers. A separate 
analysis of Arctic responses to regional aerosol perturbations is presented in Section 5. 
Results are discussed in Section 6 and summarized in Section 7.   
 
2 Methods  
The PDRMIP dataset is  described in detail by Myhre et al. (2017) . Briefly, ten global climate 
models performed experiments where five different climate drivers were perturbed 
separately . Relative to a baseline, the perturbations involve d a doubling of CO 2 
concentrations (CO2x2) , a tripling of CH 4 concentrations (CH4x3) , a two percent increase in 
the solar constant  (SOL) , a tenfold increase in BC concentrations or emissions (BCx10) , and a 
fivefold increase in SO4 concentrations or emissions (SO4x5) , respectively . In addition, seven  
of the models (see Table S1) performed three regional experiments, which simulated the 
effects of a tenfold increase in BC over  Asia (BCx10asia) and in SO4 over  Asia and Europe  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  (SO4x10asia and SO4x10europe). Here, Asia was defined as 10 -50°N and 60 -140°E, and 
Europe as 35 -70°N and 10 -40°E. These results will be described in Section 5.  
All perturbations were instantaneous, and simulations were performed in two mod es for 
both the baseline and perturbed states;  
1) A fully coupled mode , for which  equilibrium simulations were run for 100 years . 
Years 51 -100 were used  in our analyses.  These simulations give the total climate 
response.  
2) A set -up with fixed sea surface temperatures (fixed -SST), which were run for  15 
years . Years  6 to 15 were used in the analyses. These simulations give the fast (on 
the order of days to months) climate response.  
The baseline represents present -day conditions focuse d at the beginning of this century  
(except HadGEM2 -ES, which used preindustrial conditions) , but the exact year and emission 
dataset used varies slightly between models (see Table S1). For the aerosol experiments, 
five of the models  (Table S1)  performed co ncentration -driven simulations  using identical 
aerosol concentrations based on the year 2000 monthly multi -model mean of the models in 
AeroCom Phase II (Myhre et al., 2013; Samset et al., 2013)  as a baseline . Of the remaining 
models, one was not able to perform aerosol perturbations at all, while four used present -
day aerosol emissions as a baseline. In the emission -driven models, responses to the 
increase in aerosols (e.g., increased precipitation) can feed back on the aerosol 
concentrations (e.g., increased wet removal of the aerosols) and potentially dampen or 
amplify the change. Sand e t al. (2015)  found in a comparison of emission -driven and 
concentration -driven BC perturbation experiments that Arctic responses were stronger in 
the emission -driven simulations. These model differences will therefore be kept in mind in 
the subsequent a nalyses.  
The ten models represent a selection of Earth System Models with a broad variation in 
schemes and formulations. Three of the models include a represent ation of  the radiative 
impact  of BC on snow  (Table S1) . Furthermore, microphysical aerosol inter actions with 
clouds (aerosol indirect effects) is accounted for in eight models  (three of these  also include 
an indirect effect of BC).   
The fixed -SST simulations were utilized to calculate effective radiative f orcing (ERF) as 
recommended in Forster et al. (2016) , i.e., the change in net radiative long -wave (LW) plus 
short -wave (SW) fluxes at the top of atmosphere (TOA).  As indicated above, the f ixed-SST 
simulations are also used to study the fast (on the order of days to months) response of the 
climate system to the initial perturbation , also refer red to as rapid adjustments.  The total 
climate response, often (but not always) dominated by the surface -temperature change, is 
derived from the coupled simulations.  These two sets of simulations then allow us also to 
extract the pure surface temperature -driven feedback response  (also referred to as the slow 
response) as the total response minus the fast response.

In this section, we document and discuss the Arctic temperature responses to the global 
perturbations. We cover annual mean and seasonally resolved surface responses, the 
separation between rapid responses and global surface temperature driven changes, and 
the vertical structure of the temperature response. We then conclude the section with a  
discussion on inter -model differences  due to the inclusion of radiative effects of BC on snow 
in some of the models .    
3.1 Annual ly and seasonally resolved temperature responses  
As shown in previous PDRMIP studies  (Myhre et al., 2017; Samset et al., 2016; Stjern et al., 
2017) , the different perturbations cause very dissimilar responses in global mean 
temperature and ERF, with model mean warming ( and ERF) varying from 2.45  K (3.78 Wm-2) 
for CO2x2 to  0.61  K (0.66  Wm-2) for BCx10. To facilitate comparison between the different 
climate drivers, Fig . 1 shows changes per degree global temperature change in Arctic surface 
temperature  (the AA) and precipitation for each given model and experiment. Hatched bars 
indicate the regional aerosol perturbation experiments, which will be discussed in Section 5. 
For absolute changes for individual models the reader is referred to Fig. S1. Note here and 
throughout the paper that an increase in SO 4 gives a positive normalized temperature (and 
precipitation) change since the negative response it causes  in the Arctic  is normalized by a 
negative global temperature change . The horizontal grey line shows the average AA of the 
five global perturbations .

the axes limits. Graphs show monthly mean changes (for the global experiments only).  
 
We find that the AA is not significantly different ( at the 95 % confidence level, by using a 
Student’s t -test) between any of the  global  experiments . The multi -model median AA ranges 
from 1.9 (SOL ; ± an inter -model standard deviation of 0.4 ) to 2.3 (SO4x5 ; ± 0.6 ) between the 
drivers.  The horizontal grey line shows the average AA of the five global perturbations, and 
none of the solid bars deviate much from this line. Note, however, that  the inter -model 
spread is substantially larger tha n the differences in model median AA between 
experiments. This inter -model range  is partly due to the large spread in Arctic responses, 
but also due to large model differences in the global response . For instance , the outlier in 
the upper panel of Fig. 1  is CE SM-CAM5, for which a very small global response to the BCx10 
experiment produces an anomalously high AA.  CESM -CAM5’s weak temperature response is 
linked to the model’s short BC lifetime for the BCx10 experiment (Stjern et al., 2017) . With a 
few exceptions, we find that models with an above -average AA for one driver tends to have 
high values for all drivers  (and vice versa). This means that the tendency of similar AA 
regardless of driver is found both for the multi -model medians and for individual model s. 
The AA is smallest  during summ er for all the climate drivers  (Fig. 1, upper rightmost panel) . 
That  amplification is weakest during Arctic summer is well documented elsewhere: I n 
studies based on realistic historical or future scenarios with emission changes in both 
greenhouse gases and aerosols (Acosta Navarro et al., 2016; Laîné et al., 2016; Screen et al., 
2012) , in single -perturbation experime nts for e.g. SO 4 (Yang et al., 2018)  or CO 2 (Yoshimori 
et al., 2017) , and in observations (Graversen et al., 2008) . The positive ice albedo feedback is 
strong est in spring and summer , but is counteracted  by strong energy uptake by the Arctic 
ocean (Laîné et al., 2016) , as well as by an increase in evaporation (Acosta Navarro et al., 
2016; Laîné et al., 2016)  and potentially also cloud  response s (Crook et al., 2011; Yoshimori 
et al., 2017) . During winter , on the other hand, the warming from heat release by the ocean  
is strengthened by positive cloud and lapse rate feedbacks  (Laîné et al., 2016; Sejas et al., 
2014) . The dominating mechanisms contributing to this seasonal cycle differ between land 
and ocean surfaces,  with the tendency for a stronger seasonal AA cycle over oceans (Laîné 
et al., 2016) . Here, we confirm that this seasonality is not a greenhouse gas -specific 
response but is in fact climate driver independent.  To study the  land -/ocean -contrast in 
seasonality , we have repeat ed the analysis behind Fig. 1  for Arctic land -only and ocean -only 
responses . Figure S2 shows that the annually avera ged AA are consistently stronger over 
ocean than over land , supporting Laîné et al. (2016) . This is true  for all drivers. W e note  that 
the land/ocean difference can partly be an effect of latitude: the higher Arctic (where AA is 
found to be stronger , see  Fig. 2) consist s mostly of oceans while lower latitudes include 
much more land . Interestingly, over Arctic land surfaces there seems to be a secondary 
maximum in spring/early summer for BCx10. This is potentially related to the inclusion of  
the radiative effect of BC on snow (which is strongest in this season ) in some models  – see

3.2     Separating Arctic amplification into rapid responses and feedbacks from global 
temperature change  
A key methodology in PD RMIP is to separate the climate response to an instantaneous 
perturbation into rapid responses (diagnosed from fixed sea -surface temperature 
simulations), and the slow feedback response to a change in global mean surface 
temperature. In Figure S 3, we perform this separation for the AA shown in Fig . 1.  
Overall, we find weak rapid response contributions to AA. However, when removing the fast 
response to isolate the global mean temperature induced AA  (the slow feedback response) , 
the driver differences s een in Fig . 1 are reduced  (Fig. S 3). While the standard deviation of 
the multi -model median AA between these four drivers is 0.16 for the total AA (Fig. 1), the 
feedback response has a much smaller standard deviation of 0.03. SO 4, on the other hand, 
which had a non -significantly stronger AA than the other drivers for the total response, has 
an AA feedback response that is 40 % stronger than the other drivers, and the difference is 
now statistically significant.  
The only driver to show a rapid adjustment AA  significantly different from zero is CO 2. We 
interpret this to be due to its atmospheric absorption, which will act to heat the 
atmospheric column. The other driver with significant absorption, BC, has relatively little 
change in the Arctic, as discussed below.   
Recently, Huneeus et al. (2014)  compared climate effects of pert urbations to CO 2 and the 
solar constant. They found that particularly for the feedback response, the similarity was 
remarkable, while rapid adjustments introduced more dissimilar responses. Ov erall, our 
results are consistent with this finding.  
 
3.3 Geographical  temperature  response patterns  
In Figure 2, we show the multi -model geographical pattern of AA.  Overall the different 
drivers produce qualitatively similar patterns , with a maximum around the northernmost 
parts of the Barents Sea , correspond ing to the  region where all climate drivers produce the 
greates t loss in sea ice  (Fig. S 4). It should be noted that the location of this maximum 
warming may – at least partly – be an artifact of the tendency for models to have a low 
temperature bias in this region. For instance, Chapman and Walsh (2007)  found that 12 out 
of 14 models have a cold temperature bias in the Barents sea  due to too extensive sea i ce, 
and that the same models showed strongest projected temperature changes in this region . 
Still, the main point – that warming patterns are similar between drivers – remains. Maps of 
ERF demonstrate that the radiative forcing for all drivers is larger at  the lower latitudes than 
in the Arctic, meaning that  the regional ERF pattern is not an important contribution to the  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  AA (Fig. 3 ). This is also true when we look at the pattern of ERF at the surface (not shown), 
which might be more indicative of regional responses than the TOA forcing. The similarity in 
AA patterns and the decoupling of the AA from the original forcing pattern  further  imply  
that the A A is not driver specific.

3.4 Vertical structure of the Arctic amplification  
In Figure 4, we show the vertical structure of the Arctic amplification. Some studie s have 
suggested  that the vertical dimension can provide further insights into the processes driving 
surface heating in the Arctic region. Sea ice or sea surface temperature changes are typically 
found to induce strongest response near the Arctic surface (Screen et al., 2012) , while 
changes driven by processes such as changes in poleward heat transport or concentrations 
of water vapor or clouds will have a maximum response in the mid -troposphere (Chung and 
Räisänen, 2011; Graversen and Wa ng, 2009; Yang et al., 2010) . Note, however, that local 
responses and feedbacks will complicate such a clear interpretation.   
As seen from Fig. 4 a, increases in CO 2, CH 4, the solar constant and SO 4 cause very similar 
vertical patterns in the Arctic, with a strong surface AA  and an upper -level (a round  200 hPa) 
negative AA, visible  as areas over Arctic latitudes  with blue shades in the figure . This upper 
tropospheric cooling is a typical sign of a warming climate and an associated lifting of the 
tropopause, which cau ses temperatures to drop at pressure levels that used to be a part of 
the warmer stratosphere in the baseline simulations, but are included in the (colder) upper 
troposphere in the perturbed climate  (see e.g. Gillett et al., 2003) . This is not to be confused 
with the well -known stratospheric cooling following increased CO 2 (Ramanathan and 
Dickinson, 1979) , which is also visible in Fig. 2a for CO2x2, but at higher altitudes. Th e upper 
tropospheric  cooling is not visible for BC in the annual mean, but in Fig. 4b , where  we show 
monthly mean Arctic changes , we find that BC causes a similar  upper  tropospheric  cooling 
as the other climate drivers  during January through March .

latitudes 0 to 90 °N and for b) the Arctic (60 to 90 °N) average for each month of the year. Hatching 
indicates where fewer than 75 % of the models agr ee on the sign of the change.  
 
For the rest of the year, however, the warming from BC extends throughout the 
atmospheric column. BC is known to induce efficient local heating of the atmosphere, and 
has an  absorption efficiency that increases with height (Samset and Myhre, 2011) . In the 
Arctic, the atmospheric warming from  BC absorption is particularly strong due to the high 
surface albedo. The warming pattern is therefore linked to the spatiotemporal distribution 
of BC concentrations. Figure S 5a shows the BC x10 mass mixing ratio that the concentration -
based models use as input. The largest BC concentration changes occur, as expected, at the 
surface aro und 40°N, where emissions are largest. At these latitudes, air masses are 
effectively lifted by convection, resulting in elevated concentrations also at higher altitudes, 
where aerosols are transported northwards. This transport is most effective during su mmer

corresponding warming in Fig. 4 b. The strong decline in available SW radiation towards fall 
and winter also means that the radiative effect of increasing concentrations ( i.e., absorption 
of SW and consequent atmospheric warming) will be highest in the summer . At lower 
altitudes, the polar dome limits the meridional transport into the Arctic, in particular during 
winter  (Stohl, 2006) . In addition, the aerosols that are lofted at lower latitudes give strong 
high -altitude warming, as illustrated in Fig. S 5c, where the seasonal warming averaged over 
East Asia, the major source region (Fig. S 5a), for the g lobal BCx10 experiment is shown. This 
heat (and the associated increase in water vapor ) therefore does not need to be elevated 
from the surface through convection but can be transported directly  poleward . 
Comparing  the AA profile  pattern s between  0 to 90°N for winter and summer months  
separately (Fig. S 6), we find that the warming pattern for BCx10 has a much stronger 
pole ward extension in summer , consistently  with  the strong within -Arctic  summertime 
warming around 500 hPa . Graversen et al. (2008)   found a similar upper -level summertime 
amplification in reanalysis data . They  pointed out that the source of this hig h-altitude AA 
could not be surface driven (i.e., snow and ice feedbacks) and attribute d it instead to 
summertime changes in the northward energy transport.  This upper -level AA is however not 
visible in all reanalysis data sets  (Bitz and Fu, 2008; Grant et al., 2008) . While most 
pronounced for BC,  the pattern of uppe r-level summertime warming is present for all 
climate drivers  in our simulations . Dedicated studies are needed to further quantify  the role 
of northward heat transport to the consistent heating around 500 hPa . 
For all drivers , the surface AA is lowest in summer . Previous studies have found that one 
reason  for this is that (surface) warming from the ice albedo effect can be partially cancelled 
by an increase in summertime cloud cover (Crook et al., 2011) . However, while  an increase 
in summertime cloud cover is an expected response to the reduced sea ice cover  in climate 
models (Vavrus, 2004; Yoshimori et al., 2014) , observations indicate that the summer is the 
only season  which lacks a cloud -response to sea ice changes (Morrison et al., 2018) , and 
that the  cloud response tends to be strongest in  fall (Kay and Gettelman, 2009) . Here, we 
find that  while the s ea ice reductions are similar  between the drivers (Fig. S 4), changes in  
cloud amounts vary (Fig. 5) , with no general tendency of a summertime increase  for any of 
the drivers except BC . BCx10  causes a 5 % increase in summertime low cloud cover  (defined 
as the vertical average of cloud fractions between the surface and 680 hPa) , contrasting a 
very weak increase or (for CO2x2) a reduction for the other climate drivers. The BC -induced 
increase in low level clouds would act both to dampen the summe rtime surface warming, 
and (by reflecting incoming SW back towards the aerosol layer and adding to the amount of 
SW available for absorption) enhance the strong upper -level warming . Note also that 
around 500 hPa, all climate drivers cause a reduction in cl ouds, consistent with the upper -
level summertime warming  (Fig. 4b) . This response  is strongest for BC, for which the 
warming is greatest.

Figure 5.  Multi -model mean vertically resolved cloud cover change [%] for the Arctic (60 to 90°N) average 
for each month of the year, normalized by global mean temperature change.  
 
In the wintertime, there is an upward shift  the lowe r-most  clouds  in response to all  drivers , 
conceivably associated with an increase in specific humidity and therefore the lifting 
condensation level, as the atmosphere  warms. A similar Arctic cloud response was found in 
a modelling study by (Gillett et al., 2003)  as a response to CO 2 doubling. Li et al. (2014)  
noted a link between reduced Arctic boundary layer stability and a deepening of the 
boundary layer  in satellite data . The same features are found in our results during winter , 
seen as a thickening of the low -level c loud layer . This change in low-level wintertime cloud is 
important as it  will primarily act to enhance the surface warming through their long wave 
warming effect  in the absence of incoming solar radiation . 
3.5 Model differences  in BC-induced Arctic Amplification  
Light -absorbing particles , such as BC , deposited on snow and ice  may reduce the albedo and 
enhance  melting, with potentially large impact s on the radiative budget  . Of the ten PDRMIP  
models , three include the radiative effect of BC on snow . Figure 6 shows AA responses to 
the BCx10  experiment  from individu al models. M odel names are marked with [S] if they 
include BC on snow  and are shown as solid lines in the righthand panel . We focus on land -
average AA, where BC snow -albedo effects are expected to be largest  (Goldenson et al., 
2012) . Note that the CESM -CAM5 model has a particularly strong annual mean AA partly 
due to its very small global warming.

mean temperature change) AA for the BCx10 experiment, for all contributing models. [S] indicates models 
with effect of BC on snow/ice. These are marked with s olid lines , while dashed lines show models without 
the effect of BC on snow.  
 
There does not seem to be a systematic  difference in the seasonal AA cycle between the 
models with and without BC -on-snow treatment , except for a general tendency for higher 
AA in late fall/early winter . The exception is  CESM -CAM5 , which has a very strong BC -
induced amplification in spring/summer.  This is consistent with Qian et al. (2014) , who  
found that the Arctic forcing from BC on snow in the CAM5 model is substantial , and is at its 
maximum around mid-summer . There is a similar although weaker summertime maximum 
in NorESM1 , but n o such feature is discernible in MIROC -SPRINTARS.  However , due to the  
wide variety of parameterizations  and limited number of available models , these results 
should be interpreted with care . Further investigation of this effect requires more a 
dedicated stud y, where  a larger  number of model s perform sensitivity studies with and 
without the effect of BC on snow .  
 
4 Arctic precipitation responses to global perturbations  
In this section, we discuss the Arctic precipitation response to the five global pertur bations. 
As for temperature, we begin with the annual and seasonal mean responses and the impact 
of rapid adjustments. Then, we discuss precipitation change through the application of 
energy and moisture balance analyses.  
4.1  Annual ly and seasonally resolved precipitation responses  
While the Arctic surface  temperature  amplification has been thoroughly investigated, less 
attention has been given to changes in Arctic precipitation. Here we find that A rctic 
precipitation  change per degree  warming , often termed the apparent hydrological 
 
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  sensitivity  (HS), is similar ( 6-8 %/K) for all the global perturbations  (Fig. 1) . Samset et al. 
(2016)  analyzed the glob ally averaged precipitation c hange for the PDRMIP data set  and 
found a stronger apparent HS for changes in aerosols and solar insolation (around 3 %/K) 
than for greenhouse gas perturbations (around 2 %/K) . It was also found that the global 
average response  to BCx10 was negative  (i.e., a decrease) . The Arctic hydrological 
sensitivity is thus found to be stronger than the global averages, consistent with previous 
findings from simulations using the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios for a range of 
CMIP5 models (Bintanja and Selten, 2014) . Here, we are able to conclude that this is a 
robust feature among all drivers.  Testing the ten annual mean model values of SO 4-induced  
precipitation change against the other drivers using Student’s t -test we find that SO4 is 
associated with a slightly higher precipitation change, which is significantly (at the 95% 
level) different from the three other non -aerosol drivers.  
As trends in Ar ctic precipitation follows  the Arctic warming (Bintanja and Selten, 2014) , the 
seasonal variation in the change generally resembles that of the AA, with a maxim um in 
winter and smallest change during summer.  Deser et al. (2010)  performed idealized model 
experiments isolating the impact of future sea ice loss and found the same seasonality in sea 
ice and  precipitation  changes , indicating a close link. Our results also show  the strongest 
precipitation change s coincide nt with the regions of strongest warming (Fig. 2) and loss in 
sea ice (Fig. S 4), and we find that this  also is where surface evaporation increases the most 
(not shown). Th e seasonal cycle in precipitation changes is most similar between the non -
aerosol  drive rs (CO2x2, CH4x3 and SOL) . For BCx10 the changes are stronger in late 
winter/spring than in November/December . For SO4x5 there is no clear summer minimum , 
and SO4-induced precipitation changes in April through October are the highest of all 
drivers. All dr ivers have a strong relative increase in summertime convective precipitation 
(not shown), particularly over land, except fo r BC which causes a strong reduction  due to 
increased  stabilization connected with the strong upper -level warming shown in Fig. 4b. 
However, the Arctic summertime precipitation is dominated by stratiform precipitation 
formation, so changes in convective clouds play a smaller role in the  seasonal cycle of total 
precipitation . Instead, the seasonalit y can likely be attributed to seasonal variation in 
surface evaporation  or moisture transport .  
 
4.2  Separating Arctic precipitation amplification into rapid responses and feedbacks 
from global temperature change  
Like for temperature, we can separate the precipitation response into rapid adjustments 
and a slow change that scales with global mean surface temperature change. See Figure S 3. 
Here, the BC perturbation  produces precipitation response in the Arctic of opposit e sign 
from the global response  (Samset et al., 2016; Stjern et al., 2017) . Globally, the BC -induc ed 
drying has been shown to originate from the strong atmospheric absorption by the aerosols, 
which produces a very strong negative rapid adjustment that outweighs the final surface -
temperature driven increase (Andre ws et al., 2010; Kvalevåg et al., 2013; Samset et al.,  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  2016) . However, Samset et al. (2016)  demonstrated a regional dependency on the 
distribution between slow and fa st changes, with a dominance of the slow response 
(increasing precipitation) in the Arctic region.  This characteristic is confirmed in  Fig. S 3, 
where the rapid  precipitation response  for BCx10 is close to zero . 
 
4.3 Arctic precipitation changes through an energy balance perspective  
To understand the mechanisms behind the Arctic precipitation changes  for individual 
drivers , we utilize the energy budget approach (O’Gorman et al., 2011; Richard son et al., 
2016) . Wh en we calculate the atmospheric energy budget , contributions to the total 
precipitation change can be subdivided into changes in longwave atmospheric cooling LWC, 
shortwave atmospheric heating SWH, the net upward sensible heat at the surface, SH,  and 
the dry static energy flux divergence  Hdry: 
𝑳𝒅𝑷 =𝒅𝑳𝑾𝑪  – 𝒅𝑺𝑾𝑯  – 𝒅𝑺𝑯  + 𝒅𝑯 𝒅𝒓𝒚                (1) 
Above, L is the latent heat of condensation of water vapor  and P is the surface precipitation . 
The column -integrated dry static energy flux divergen ce change  dHdry is calculated as the 
residual between the preci pitation  change  LdP and the other terms , and contributes 
positively to precipitation change if more dry static energy  is transported out of  the Arctic 
atmospheric column in the perturbed climate . Alternatively, we may use a simplified 
moisture budget , following Bintanja and Selten (2014) :  
𝑳𝒅𝑷 =𝒅𝑬+ 𝒅𝑭 𝒎𝒐𝒊 𝒔𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆                 (2) 
Here, E denotes the evaporation  from the surface, and the transport of moist ure into the 
Arctic  (dFmois ture) is calculated as the difference between LdP and dE. 
The energy and moisture budget analys es of total Arctic precipitation changes are shown in 
Fig. 7a, again normalized by the global mean temperature change. Note that LdP indicates 
the total Arctic precipitation change per global warming, but in contrast to Fig. 1 , it shows  
model means (a s opposed to model medians)  and absolute changes (as opposed to relative 
changes) . This is necessary  to produce meaningful energy budget s and calculat e residuals  
but gives rise to some differences  between this figure and Fig. 1 . Immediately apparent 
from Fig. 7 a is how different the energy budget components are  for the global BC 
perturbation compared to the other drivers. Even so, the total precipitation change is 
similar between BC and the other drivers , as in Fig.1 .  
Short wave heating is shown with a negative prefix in Fig. 7a, since a reduction in short wave 
heating contributes to increased precipitation. For all drivers, this budget term is  negative, 
indicating  increases in short wave atmospheric heating.  In general, short wave heating  is 
driven by elevated  atmospheric water vapor concentrations in the warmer climate  (recall  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  that the sign of the SO 4 responses are turned in the normalization by the global mean 
temperature change) . However, due to  the strong additional absorption by atmos pheric BC 
particles, this term is by far strongest for BC . It is also stronger over land than over oceans 
(not shown ) where BC concentrations are highest . Changes in long wave co oling are positive 
for all driver s, again a s a general response to the warming  climate . The long wave cooling is  
strongest for BC  since  long wave radiation is re -emitted from high -altitude BC particles  after 
their absorption of solar radiation . The smaller long wave cooling of CO2x2 than SO4x4  is 
because in the Arctic, as opposed to  in the global average, the rapid response to an increase 
in CO 2 is a reduction in long wave cooling , which lowers its total increase . The sensible heat 
flux is affected by changes in the temperature difference between the surface and the 
overlaying air, as well as by changes in turbulen ce and convection.  Globally, the change in 
this quantity is minor  for all drivers but BC, as shown in a previous PDRMIP study (Myhre et 
al., 2018) . We find that this is true also in the Arctic . The strong atmospheric  warming 
caused by BC (Fig. 4 ) leads to a marked  reduction in the sensible heat flux , which is stronger 
over land than over oceans . Finally, all drivers cause an increase  in the dry static energy flux 
divergence. This term is negative (indicating energy transport into the Arctic) in the baseline 
climate but slightly less negative in t he perturbed climate, meaning that  the poleward 
energy transport  is reduced. This is a natural consequence of the Arctic amplification, by 
which the high latitudes warm more than the lower latitudes and the meridional 
temperature gradient is reduced. For all drivers, but especially for BC, the reduced dry static 
energy  flux diver gence  is strongest in the summer season (not shown) . 
Previous studies highlight the role of moisture transport from lower latitudes to Arctic 
precipitation changes (Bengtsson et al., 2011; Kug et al., 2010) . Still, in dications from both 
observations (Kattsov and Wals h, 2000)  and model simulations (Bintanja and Selten, 2014)  
are that the dominating cause of the precipitation change may be the strong intensification 
of local surface evaporation . Here, we find that the change in moisture transport  (dF moisture ) 
is of similar magnitude as  increased evaporation ( dE) for CO2x2, CH4x3 and SOL . For SO 4, 
contribution from evaporation  is higher than that from moisture transport  and for BC there 
is a statistically significant higher impact from the latter , whereas the evaporation change  is 
negligible . This means that the dominating processes behind Arctic precipitation changes 
may shift depending on what climate driver has the dominating impact in the Arctic.  
We next  examine the  seasonal variations in the dFmoisture  and dE terms, and their 
contribution  to the  total  precipitation change . In Fig. 7 b the seasonal absolute change in 
precipitation is shown as a solid black line  and t he monthly contribution of evaporation and 
moisture transport changes to this precipitation change is indicated by the bars. Fo r CO2x2, 
CH4x3, SOL and SO4x5 , the  increase in surface evaporation is greatest in June, with a 
secondary maximum in late fall/early winter.  BC, on the other hand, causes a small increase 
in evaporation in all seasons except  summer, when  there is a notable  reduction . This is 
when available incoming solar radiation and enhanced BC concentrations combine to 
produce the seasonally strongest reduction in the amount of short -wave radiation that  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  reaches the surface, an effect known as solar dimming . For BC, the moisture transport term 
is much larger than for the other drivers, and it is the dominant cause of the BC -induced 
Arctic precipitation changes. During winter, the relative importance of evaporation and 
moisture transport changes for SO 4 are com parable to the other (non -BC) drivers , while 
evaporation changes dominate in the summer . Recall, however, that the sign is turned by 
the normalization by a negative global mean temperature change. In reality, increased 
concentrations of SO4 causes reduced moisture transport and evaporation throughout the 
year, but like for BC, there is a particularly strong  reduction in  evaporation in the summer 
months  due to  enhanced  solar dimming. Conversely, CO 2 induces  the weakest evaporation 
change of all the drivers  in this season  due to a negative rapid response (not shown) that 
lowers the total positive change . These differences explain the stronger precipitation -
response to SO 4 than to the other non -aerosol drivers, as shown in Fig. 1. 
 
Figure 7. a) Model mean atmospheric energy budget and moisture budget analysis for the Arctic, 
normalized by global mean temperature change. The sign convention is such that positive values indicate 
 
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  that the term contributes to increased precipitation. LdP is the total precipitat ion change. Components of 
the energy budget are shown in between the two vertical lines, where dLWC is the change in longwave 
atmospheric cooling, dSWH is the change in shortwave atmospheric heating, dSH is the change in 
sensible heat at the surface and dH dry is the change in dry static energy flux divergence. Components of 
the moisture budget are at the rightmost side, where dE is change in surface evaporation and dF moisture  is 
moisture transport into the Arctic. Vertical lines show the inter -model standar d deviation. b) Contribution 
of the moisture budget terms to the absolute monthly precipitation change.  
 
For all drivers we find a maximum change in poleward moisture transport around  August 
through October . This summer/autumn maximum is likely a contributing cause for the 
strong seasonal upper -level warming for BC , for which the moisture transport term is 
particularly strong . Moisture from lower latitudes can be a source of heat within the Arctic, 
in the fo rm of latent heat release, increased water vapor greenhouse effect or changes to 
clouds.  Sedlar and Tjernström (2017)  found a clear pattern of increased lower -level and 
decrease d upper -level clouds in months with particularly strong moisture a dvection into the 
Arctic, similar to the cloud change pattern we see during summer for BCx10 (Fig. 5).  
We note for consistency that Bintanja and Selten (2014)  found  strongest late-century 
increases in moisture transport in summer /early autumn  for a range of CMIP5 models under 
the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5  emission scenarios . The later seasonal maximum in our data is 
related to our broad definition of the Arctic  as all area north of 60° N: using  70°N instead  
shifts  the maximum transport change towards mid-summer (see Fig. S 7). 
 
5 Arctic  responses to regional perturbations  
Seven of the ten models performed additional simulations , where BC was  perturb ed in a 
subregion of  Asia and SO 4 was perturbed in parts of Asia and Europe  (see Section 2 for 
detailed description of these regions) . Two of these models ran emission -based simulations , 
leading to additional model differences due to differences in  transport, wet removal and 
other processe s. The remaining five used concentration -based set -ups, which diminishes the 
sources for model differences , and allows for more focus on dynamical responses . Given 
these differences , we have here chosen to present the concentration -based and the 
emission -based results separately, even if the latter will only show the mean of two models.  
Figure 8 shows the equivalent of Fig. 1, where solid and hatched bars represent  global and 
regional perturbations, respectively, but for the subset of five  concentration -based models 
in Fig. 8a and two emission -based in Fig. 8b.   
Starting with the concentration -driven  models, we find that t he Asian BC perturbation 
produces a stronger Arctic amplification , as well as a stronger precipitation response, than 
the global perturbation. This contrasts the response to the regional SO 4 perturbations,  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  which both cause an AA more like the global experiment . There is a tendency for a stronger 
AA and stronger precipitation response from the European than from the Asian SO 4 
perturbation, but the difference s are not statistically significant.  Figure 9 a shows vertical AA 
profiles by latitude north, similar to Fig. 4 a, for the concentration -driven models . The 
warming pattern for BCx10asia is more focused around the latitudes o f the regional 
emissions (around 40°N), but otherwise resembles  the global pattern. The AA signal s from 
the regional SO 4 perturbation s have much clearer maxima over the emission latitudes than 
the global signal, but as opposed to the regional BC perturbation they do not show the same 
clear poleward extension of the AA.  
The two emission -driven models (Fig. 8b) have stronger AA than the concentrat ion-driven 
models, both for the global and the regional experiments. As mentioned  in Section 2, 
emission -driven models have the potential for an amplified  or dampened  response since  the 
model’s climate response may feed back on the BC concentrations , as found in Sand et al. 
(2015) . Notably , while regional BC perturbations caused stronger AA  than global for the 
concentration -driven models, the opposite is true for the emission -driven , due to a very 
strong AA for the global perturbation. However, this  includes results from  NCAR -CAM5 , 
which was seen to be an outlier (Fig. 1 ). With the exception of the BCx10 experiment, the 
AA responses of the two individual emission -driven models a re very similar  (note the circles 
in the figure, indicating individual model values) .

change) to global (solid bars) versus regional (hatched bars) perturbations in BC and SO 4, averaged over 
the Arctic, for a) five concentration -based models (see Table S1) and b) two emission -based models. Bars 
show annual model median values, individual model values are shown as circles. Horizontal bars indicate 
± one standard deviation, and triangles are used to indicate when standard deviations are outside the 
range of the axes limits.  
 
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  While the concentration -driven models had no discernible AA difference between the two 
regional SO 4 perturbations, the tenfold increase in SO 4 in Europe causes a significantly 
stronger AA than a tenfold increase in Asia  for the emission -driven models . This difference is 
particularly clear in the summ ertime, while wint ertime responses are more similar  (not 
shown) . The similarity in wintertime responses can be explained by that fact that d uring 
winter, Europe and  Eurasia are both located within the polar d ome ( i.e., the surfaces of 
constant potential temperature) . This, and the fact that parts of these regions are covered 
in snow in winter, which cools the near -surface air and eases transport into the polar dome,  
allows air masses from both these regions to reach the Arctic through l ow-level transport 
(Stohl, 2006) . Air masses that are too warm (i.e., air originating from lower latitudes in 
summer)  for isentropic transport reach the Arctic through lifting outside the polar dome and 
may subsequently slowly d escen d within. Indeed, c omparing seasonal vertical warming 
patterns between the European and the Asian SO 4 perturbations in Fig. S6, we see that 
while the summertime Arctic response to SO 4 perturbations in the (warmer , more remote  
and with more effective convective lifting ) Asian region  is mostly confined to the mid -
troposphere, the impact from European SO 4 extends all the way to the surface.  This 
produces notable differences in surface AA (Fig. 8b) between the two experiments. A 
wintertime warming , on the other hand, is visible at the Arctic surface in both the European 
and the Asian SO 4 perturbation experiment s. The Europe -only perturbation also y ields a 
higher precipitation response than the Asian -only perturbation.

© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  Our findings for the emission -driven models , that Arctic temperature and precipitation 
responses are significantly  stronger for the Europ ean than for Asian  perturbations , are in 
line with previous findings (Aamaas et al., 2016; Bellou in et al., 2016; Sand et al., 2016; 
Stjern et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2013) . For instance , Sand et al. (2016)  shows that Europe and 
Russia are the regions that influence Arctic temperatures th e most per unit emissions , and  
the large sulfate emission change  in Europe over the past decades  have been linked to 
changes  in Arctic sea ice cover (Acosta Navarro et al., 2016; Gagné et al., 2017; Mueller et 
al., 2018) . The greater  impact of European emissions  is likely due to factors connected with 
the nearer proximity of Europe to the Arctic, but may also be related to a saturation of 
aerosol -cloud interactions over East Asia, as well as a greater climatological cloud cover, 
which could mask the direct aerosol forcing in that region (Kasoar et al., 2018) . In another 
PDRMIP  analysis Liu et al. (2018)  also found  that the forcing from European SO 4 increases 
had a stronger efficacy in terms of global temperatures and precipitation effects than that 
from the Asian region. In the present study we find the concentration -based models do not 
show this difference , at l east in the Arctic . However, the regional PDRMIP simulations is 
limited in terms of number of regions, making it difficult  to confidently conclude on regional 
impacts on Arctic climate.  
 
6 Discussion  
Common for the Arctic impact  studies mentioned in the previous section  is that they focus 
on responses per unit emissions . In reality , SO2 emissions in Europe are relatively low  today , 
while SO 2 emissions in India are currently increasing strongly  (Li et al., 2017) . Sand et al. 
(2016)  stress that due to the large absolute emissions of SLCF (particularly BC) from the 
Asian continent, this is presently the largest source of SLCF -driven Arctic warming – both 
due to long -range transport and  due to  localized radiative impact and subsequent transport 
of heat and moisture. However, large emission changes in this  region are ongoing (van der A 
et al., 2017) . Recent studies suggest that emissions of sulfur dioxide in China has decreased 
by 75 % over the past decade and that India is taking over as the lar gest single -region 
emitter (Li et al., 2017) . In contrast, emissions of BC and CO 2 have continued to increase in 
both regions (e.g., Hoesly et al., 2017) . Persad and Caldeira (2018)  looked at impacts from 
anthropogenic aerosol (including both SO 4 and BC) changes in a range of regions, using the 
NCAR -CAM5 model , and found substantial variations in how emissions from different 
regions influence the global temperature. They found that regions which historically or 
presently account for the majority of anthropogenic aerosol emissions have the largest 
impacts on temperature , while regions where emissions currently have or are projected to 
have strong tr ends (i.e., India or East Africa)  have smaller temperature impacts.  This 
suggests that, globally averaged, the future distribution of main emission regions may have 
a smaller cooling potential than historically.  Importantly, however,  one reason for the sma ll 
global temperature impact of Indian emissions was a regionally heterogeneous pattern of  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  both positive and negative temperature responses. And while increased aerosol emissions 
in general cause a cooling, the Arctic response to Indian emission changes in this study was 
a warming.   
Energy and moisture transport from lower latitudes play an important role in the impact on 
Arctic climate. Recent research ha s looked closer into how poleward energy tr ansport  
contributes to current and future AA, and to how it will react to the reduced meridional 
temperature gradient  following an AA  (Graversen, 2006; Jonas et al., 2016; Kapsch et al., 
2013) . They find that it is the transport of latent heat, and not of dry -static energy, that 
dominates the contribution t o AA. As for future changes in these energy transport terms, 
simulations show that while models do not agree on the sign of the change in the total 
poleward heat transport, they all predict a reduction in the dry static energy transport (as 
the faster Arct ic warming reduces the temperature gradient between high and low 
latitudes), and an increase in the latent heat transport (Hwang et al., 2011) . Here, we find 
that the contribution from the dry -static energy flux divergence to the Arctic precipitation 
change differs between climate drivers, but is particularly important for BC. It is however 
positive for all drivers and all individual models, indicating a r eduction in northward energy 
transport . We  also find , for all drivers,  an increase in the northward transport of moisture, 
consistent with Hwang et al. (2011) . We note that t he o cean has been shown to play an 
important role in the poleward heat transport (Nummelin et al., 2017) , but here , we have 
not looked at changes in this component. A separate study investigating how  different 
climate drivers influence the various elements of the poleward energy tr ansport could 
improve our ability to predict how the Arctic would respond to future emission and climate 
changes.  
Many of the processes involved when simulating climate resp onses in the Arctic are 
associated with high levels of uncertainty. One example  is the effect of BC aerosols on ice 
and snow , with estimates ranging from  relatively  weak (Bond et al., 2013)  to strong er 
(Flanner et al., 2007)  effects. Here, three of the contributi ng models (NorESM1, CESM -CAM5  
and MIROC -SPRINTARS ) include estimates of the radiative effect of BC on snow in their 
models , but in only one of these (CESM -CAM5) do we see a clear signal from this effect in 
the seasonal  warming in the Arctic. Differences in how models treat processes such as BC on  
snow nevertheless contributes to be a source of uncertainty and deviations between 
models. Previous multi -model studies have found that the spread in model responses is 
particularly large in the Arctic (Sand et al., 2017) , and this is also the case here: Table S3 
shows that the inter -model standard deviation for both temperature and precipitation is 
typically a factor three or more larger in the Arctic than gl obally.

The Arctic is influenced by both local and remote emissions (Acosta Navarro et al., 2016; 
Gagné et al., 2017) . Presently, global and regional trends  in emissions are shifting rapidly.  
While global CO 2 emissions are still increasing (Le Quéré et al., 2018) , there are significant 
regional differences in air pollutant trends (Hoesly et a l., 2017; Li et al., 2017) . Combined 
with underlying climate change, potentially affecting transport pathways (Jiao and Flanner, 
2016) , this may shift the relative importance of individual climate drivers for Arctic climate 
change. Moreover, a erosol emissions  in individual regions may have a different impact on 
Arctic climate t o global perturbations.  
The present study analyzes the response of perturbations to five individual climate drivers  
(CO 2, CH 4, the solar constant, SO 4 and BC) , investigating effects on Arctic temperature and 
precipitation . While some notable differences exist, particularly for BC, response patterns in 
the vertical temperature profile are broadly similar between climate drivers. The Ar ctic 
amplification in surface temperature ranges only from 1.9 [± 0.4] (SOL) to 2.3  [± 0.6 ] (SO4x5) 
between drivers , and inter -driver differences are not statistically significant . As indicated in 
previous studies, the majority of the Arctic response seems  to originate from a generalized 
dynamical response to the climate warming. This is also reflected in the present analysis 
through the  similar surface Arctic amplification (AA) pattern across  all drivers and in the fact 
that all drivers cause the strongest surface warming in winter. All drivers  display  a similar 
pattern of upper -level (~400 hPa) AA in the summer , and a reduction in cloud cover in the 
same altitude and season . For BC, we see  a much stronger upper -level AA than for the other 
climate drivers . This is likely connected to increased high -level concentrations of BC in 
summer, as well as a very strong BC-induced summertime increase in poleward moisture 
transport, which may induce additional warming through short wave absorption by BC 
particles and an added water vapor greenhouse effect. T his warming does not propagate 
down to the Arctic surface. A stronger increase in summertime low cloud cover (which tend s 
to cool the surface)  for the BC perturbations may instead act as a buffering effect, so that all 
climate drivers end up causing relatively similar surface AA, with maxima in winter and 
minima in summer . 
Global temperature change -normalized p recipitation responses are also relatively similar 
between drivers, although less so than for temperature. SO 4 cause s significantly stronger  
(normalized)  precipitation increases than the other non -aerosol  drivers , driven by a much 
stronger evaporation change . This difference is particularly pronounced in the summer. An 
energy budget break -down of the contribution of different processes to the precipitation 
change shows that the BC response is substantially stronger than those of the other climate 
drivers in in all these processes. In total, however, the different contributions cancel out to 
leave a precipitation change similar to that from the other climate drivers.  While changes in 
poleward moisture transport and changes in evaporation have similar contribution s to the 
total precipitation change for CO2x2, CH4x3 and SOL, the aerosol -driven precipitation  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  changes differ, with a dominance of moisture transport in the case of BC x10 and a 
dominance of evaporation changes for SO4x4.  
Our study present s a first, comprehensive overview of how Arctic temperature and 
precipitation responds to individual climate drivers. While further analysis is needed to fully 
disentangle all the processes that act to shape the Arctic climate response, we conclude that 
overall, responses are similar enough to provide confidence in scenario -based projections 
for Arctic climate change regardless of the detailed balance between components of future 
emissions.

Abstract. The Pliocene epoch has great potential to improve
our understanding of the long-term climatic and environ-
mental consequences of an atmospheric CO 2concentration
near400 parts per million by volume. Here we present
the large-scale features of Pliocene climate as simulated by a
new ensemble of climate models of varying complexity and
spatial resolution based on new reconstructions of bound-ary conditions (the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project
Phase 2; PlioMIP2). As a global annual average, modelled
surface air temperatures increase by between 1.7 and 5.2C
relative to the pre-industrial era with a multi-model mean
value of 3.2C. Annual mean total precipitation rates in-
crease by 7 % (range: 2 %–13 %). On average, surface air
temperature (SAT) increases by 4.3C over land and 2.8C

over the oceans. There is a clear pattern of polar ampliﬁ-
cation with warming polewards of 60N and 60S exceed-
ing the global mean warming by a factor of 2.3. In the At-
lantic and Paciﬁc oceans, meridional temperature gradients
are reduced, while tropical zonal gradients remain largely
unchanged. There is a statistically signiﬁcant relationship be-
tween a model’s climate response associated with a doubling
in CO 2(equilibrium climate sensitivity; ECS) and its simu-
lated Pliocene surface temperature response. The mean en-
semble Earth system response to a doubling of CO 2(includ-
ing ice sheet feedbacks) is 67 % greater than ECS; this is
larger than the increase of 47 % obtained from the PlioMIP1
ensemble. Proxy-derived estimates of Pliocene sea surface
temperatures are used to assess model estimates of ECS and
give an ECS range of 2.6–4.8C. This result is in general
accord with the ECS range presented by previous Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Re-
ports.
1 Introduction
1.1 Pliocene climate modelling and overview of the
Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project
Efforts to understand climate dynamics during the mid-
Piacenzian warm period (MP; 3.264 to 3.025 million years
ago), previously referred to as the mid-Pliocene warm period,
have been ongoing for more than 25 years. This is because
the study of the MP enables us to address important scientiﬁc
questions. The inclusion of a Pliocene experiment within the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)
experimental protocols underlines the general potential of the
Pliocene to address questions regarding the long-term sensi-
tivity of climate and environments to forcing, as well as the
determination of climate sensitivity speciﬁcally.
Beginning with the initial climate modelling studies of
Chandler et al. (1994), Sloan et al. (1996), and Haywood
et al. (2000), the complexity and number of climate models
used to study the MP has since increased substantially (e.g.
Haywood and Valdes, 2004). This progression culminated
in 2008 with the initiation of a co-ordinated international
model intercomparison project for the Pliocene (Pliocene
Model Intercomparison Project, PlioMIP). PlioMIP Phase 1
(PlioMIP1) proposed a single set of model boundary condi-
tions based on the U.S. Geological Survey PRISM3D dataset
(Dowsett et al., 2010) and a uniﬁed experimental design for
atmosphere-only and fully coupled atmosphere–ocean cli-
mate models (Haywood et al., 2010, 2011).
PlioMIP1 produced several publications analysing diverse
aspects of MP climate. The large-scale temperature and pre-
cipitation response of the model ensemble was presented in
Haywood et al. (2013a). The global annual mean surface air
temperature was found to have increased compared to the
pre-industrial era, with models showing warming of between1.8 and 3.6C. The warming was predicted at all latitudes but
showed a clear pattern of polar ampliﬁcation resulting in a
reduced Equator to pole surface temperature gradient. Mod-
elled sea-ice responses were studied by Howell et al. (2016)
who demonstrated a signiﬁcant decline in Arctic sea-ice ex-
tent, with some models simulating a seasonally sea-ice-free
Arctic Ocean driving polar ampliﬁcation of the warming. The
reduced meridional temperature gradient inﬂuenced atmo-
spheric circulation in a number of ways, such as the poleward
shift of the middle-latitude westerly winds (Li et al., 2015).
In addition, Corvec and Fletcher (2017) studied the effect
of reduced meridional temperature gradients on tropical at-
mospheric circulation. They demonstrated a weaker tropical
circulation during the MP, speciﬁcally a weaker Hadley cir-
culation, and in some climate models also a weaker Walker
circulation, a response akin to model predictions for the fu-
ture (IPCC, 2013). Tropical cyclones (TCs) were analysed by
Yan et al. (2016) who demonstrated that average global TC
intensity and duration increased during the MP, but this result
was sensitive to how much tropical sea surface temperatures
(SSTs) increased in each model. Zhang et al. (2013, 2016)
studied the East Asian and west African summer monsoon
response in the PlioMIP1 ensemble and found that both were
stronger during the MP, whilst Li et al. (2018) reported that
the global land monsoon system during the MP simulated in
the PlioMIP1 ensemble generally expanded poleward with
increased monsoon precipitation over land.
The modelled response in ocean circulation was also ex-
amined in PlioMIP1. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation (AMOC) was analysed by Zhang et al. (2013).
No clear pattern of either weakening or strengthening of the
AMOC could be determined from the model ensemble, a re-
sult at odds with long-standing interpretations of MP merid-
ional SST gradients being a result of enhanced ocean heat
transport (OHT; e.g. Dowsett et al., 1992). Hill et al. (2014)
analysed the dominant components of MP warming across
the PlioMIP1 ensemble using an energy balance analysis.
In the tropics, increased temperatures were determined to
be predominantly a response to direct CO 2forcing, while at
high latitudes, changes in clear sky albedo became the domi-
nant contributor, with the warming being only partially offset
by cooling driven by cloud albedo changes.
The PlioMIP1 ensemble was used to help constrain equi-
librium climate sensitivity (ECS; Hargreaves and Annan,
2016). ECS is deﬁned as the global temperature response
to a doubling of CO 2once the energy balance has reached
equilibrium (this diagnostic is discussed further in Sect. 2.4).
Based on the PRISM3 (Pliocene Research, Interpretation and
Synoptic Mapping version 3) compilation of MP tropical
SSTs, Hargreaves and Annan (2016) estimated that ECS is
between 1.9 and 3.7C. In addition, the PlioMIP1 model en-
semble was used to estimate Earth system sensitivity (ESS).
ESS is deﬁned as the temperature change associated with
a doubling of CO 2and includes all ECS feedbacks along
with long timescale feedbacks such as those involving ice

sheets. In PlioMIP1, ESS was estimated to be a factor of 1.47
higher than the ECS (ensemble mean ECS D3:4C; ensem-
ble mean ESSD5:0C; Haywood et al., 2013a).
1.2 From PlioMIP1 to PlioMIP2
The ability of the PlioMIP1 models to reproduce patterns of
surface temperature change, reconstructed by marine and ter-
restrial proxies, was investigated via data–model compari-
son (DMC) in Dowsett et al. (2012, 2013) and Salzmann et
al. (2013) respectively. Although the PlioMIP1 ensemble was
able to reproduce many of the spatial characteristics of SST
and surface air temperature (SAT) warming, the models ap-
peared unable to simulate the magnitude of warming recon-
structed at the higher latitudes, in particular in the high North
Atlantic (Dowsett et al., 2012, 2013; Haywood et al., 2013a;
Salzmann et al., 2013). This problem has also been reported
as an outcome of DMC studies for other time periods in-
cluding the early Eocene (e.g. Lunt et al., 2012). Haywood
et al. (2013a, b) discussed the possible contributing factors
to the noted discrepancies in DMCs, noting three primary
causal groupings: uncertainty in model boundary conditions,
uncertainty in the interpretation of proxy data and uncertainty
in model physics (for example, recent studies have demon-
strated that this model–proxy mismatch has been reduced
by including explicit aerosol–cloud interactions in the newer
generations of models; Sagoo and Storelvmo, 2017; Feng et
al., 2019).
These ﬁndings substantially inﬂuenced the experimen-
tal design for the second phase of PlioMIP (PlioMIP2).
Speciﬁcally, PlioMIP2 was developed to (a) reduce uncer-
tainty in model boundary conditions and (b) reduce un-
certainty in proxy data reconstruction. To accomplish (a),
state-of-the-art approaches were adopted to generate an en-
tirely new palaeogeography (compared to PlioMIP1), includ-
ing accounting for glacial isostatic adjustments and changes
in dynamic topography. This led to speciﬁc changes com-
pared to the PlioMIP1 palaeogeography capable of inﬂuenc-
ing climate model simulations (Dowsett et al., 2016; Otto-
Bliesner et al., 2017). These include the Bering Strait and
Canadian Archipelago becoming subaerial and modiﬁcations
of the land–sea mask in the Indonesian and Australian re-
gion for the emergence of the Sunda and Sahul shelves.
To achieve (b), it was necessary to move away from time-
averaged global SST reconstructions and towards the exam-
ination of a narrow time slice during the late Pliocene that
has almost identical astronomical parameters to the present
day. This made the orbital parameters speciﬁed in model
experimental design consistent with the way in which or-
bital parameters would have inﬂuenced the pattern of sur-
face climate and ice sheet conﬁguration preserved in the ge-
ological record. Using the astronomical solution of Laskar et
al. (2004), Haywood et al. (2013b) identiﬁed a suitable inter-
glacial event during the late Pliocene (Marine Isotope Stage
KM5c, 3.205 Ma). The new PRISM4 (Pliocene Research, In-terpretation and Synoptic Mapping version 4) community-
sourced global dataset of SSTs (Foley and Dowsett, 2019)
targets the same interval in order to produce point-based SST
data.
Here we brieﬂy present the PlioMIP2 experimental design,
details of the climate models included in the ensemble and
the boundary conditions used. Following this, we present the
large-scale climate features of the PlioMIP2 ensemble fo-
cused solely on an examination of the control MP simula-
tion designated as a CMIP6 simulation (called midPliocene-
eoi400 ) and its differences to simulated conditions for the
pre-industrial era (PI). We also present key differences be-
tween PlioMIP2 and PlioMIP1. PlioMIP2 sensitivity experi-
ments will be presented in subsequent studies. We conclude
by presenting the outcomes from a DMC using the PlioMIP2
model ensemble and a newly constructed PRISM4 global
compilation of SSTs (Foley and Dowsett, 2019) and by as-
sessing the signiﬁcance of the PlioMIP2 ensemble in under-
standing equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and Earth sys-
tem sensitivity (ESS).
2 Methods
2.1 Boundary conditions
All model groups participating in PlioMIP2 were required
to use standardized boundary condition datasets for the
core midPliocene-eoi400 experiment (for wider accessibil-
ity, this experiment will hereafter be referred to as Plio Core).
These were derived from the U.S. Geological Survey PRISM
dataset, speciﬁcally the latest iteration of the reconstruc-
tion known as PRISM4 (Dowsett et al., 2016). They include
spatially complete gridded datasets at 11of latitude–
longitude resolution for the distribution of land versus sea,
topography and bathymetry, as well as vegetation, soils, lakes
and land ice cover. Two versions of the PRISM4 bound-
ary conditions were produced which are known as enhanced
and standard. The enhanced version comprises all PRISM4
boundary conditions including all reconstructed changes to
the land–sea mask and ocean bathymetry. However, groups
which are unable to change their land–sea mask can use the
standard version of the PRISM4 boundary conditions, which
provides the best possible realization of Pliocene conditions
based around a modern land–sea mask. In practice, all mod-
els except MRI-CGCM2.3 were able to utilize the enhanced
boundary conditions. For full details of the PRISM4 recon-
struction and methods associated with its development, the
reader is referred to Dowsett et al. (2016; this special issue).
2.2 Experimental design
The experimental design for Plio Coreand associated PI con-
trol experiments (hereafter referred to as PI Ctrl) was pre-
sented in Haywood et al. (2016a; this special issue), and
the reader is referred to this paper for full details of the ex-
https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-2095-2020 Clim. Past, 16, 2095–2123, 20202098 A. M. Haywood et al.: Pliocene climate and climate sensitivity
perimental design. In brief, participating model groups had
a choice of which version of the PRISM4 boundary condi-
tions to implement (standard or enhanced). This approach
was taken in recognition of the technical complexity as-
sociated with the modiﬁcation of the land–sea mask and
ocean bathymetry in some of the very latest climate and
earth system models. A choice was also included regard-
ing the treatment of vegetation. Model groups could either
prescribe vegetation cover from the PRISM4 dataset (vege-
tation sourced from Salzmann et al., 2008) or simulate the
vegetation using a dynamic global vegetation model. If the
latter was chosen, all models were required to be initialized
with pre-industrial vegetation and spun up until an equilib-
rium vegetation distribution was reached. The concentration
of atmospheric CO 2for experiment Plio Corewas set at 400
parts per million by volume (ppmv), a value almost iden-
tical to that chosen for the PlioMIP1 experimental design
(405 ppmv) and in line with the very latest high-resolution
proxy reconstruction of atmospheric CO 2of400 ppmv for
3:2 million years ago using boron isotopes (De La Vega
et al., 2018). However, we acknowledge that there are un-
certainties on the KM5c CO 2value; hence, the speciﬁcation
of Tier 1 PlioMIP2 experiments (Haywood et al., 2016a),
which have CO 2of350 and 450 ppmv, will be used to
investigate CO 2uncertainty at a later date. All other trace
gases, orbital parameters and the solar constant were spec-
iﬁed to be consistent with each model’s PI Ctrlexperiment.
The Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) was conﬁned to high eleva-
tions in the eastern Greenland mountains, covering an area
approximately 25 % of the present-day GIS. The PlioMIP2
Antarctic ice sheet conﬁguration is the same as PlioMIP1
and has no ice over western Antarctica. The reconstructed
PRISM4 ice sheets have a total volume of 20 :1106km3,
which is equal to a sea-level increase relative to the present
day of less than24 m (Dowsett et al., 2016; this special
issue). The integration length was set to be as long as pos-
sible or a minimum of 500 simulated years; however, all
but two of the modelling groups in PlioMIP2 contributed
simulations that were in excess of 1000 years (Table S1 in
the Supplement). All modelling groups were requested to
fully detail their implementation of PRISM4 boundary con-
ditions along with the initialization and spin-up of their ex-
periments in separate dedicated papers that also present some
of the key scientiﬁc results from each model or family of
models (see the separate papers within this special volume:
https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/special_issue642.html, last
access: 16 September 2020, Haywood et al., 2016b). NetCDF
versions of all boundary conditions used for the Plio Coreex-
periment, along with guidance notes for modelling groups,
can be found here: https://geology.er.usgs.gov/egpsc/prism/

There are currently 16 climate models that have completed
the Plio Core experiment to comprise the PlioMIP2 ensem-
ble. These models were developed at different times and
have differing levels of complexity and spatial resolution. A
further model HadGEM3 is currently running the Plio Core
experiment and results from this model will be compared
with the rest of the PlioMIP2 ensemble in a subsequent
paper. The current 16 model ensemble is double the size
of the coupled atmosphere–ocean ensemble presented in
the PlioMIP1 large-scale features publication (Haywood et
al., 2013a). Summary details of the included models and
model physics, along with information regarding the imple-
mentation of PRISM4 boundary conditions and each model’s
ECS, can be found in Tables 1 and S1. Each modelling group
uploaded the ﬁnal 100 years of each simulation for analysis.
These were then regridded onto a regular 11grid using a
bilinear interpolation to enable each model to be analysed in
the same way. Means and standard deviations for each model
were then calculated across the ﬁnal 50 years.
2.4 Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and Earth
system sensitivity (ESS)
In Sect. 3.6, we use the Plio Coreand PI Ctrlsimulations to in-
vestigate ECS and ESS. The Plio Coreexperiments represent
a 400 ppmv world that is in quasi-equilibrium with respect to
both climate and ice sheets and hence represents an “Earth
system” response to the 400 ppmv CO 2forcing. The Earth
system response to a doubling of CO 2(i.e. 560–280 ppmv;
ESS) can then be estimated as follows:
ESSDln560
280
ln400
280(Plio Core[SAT] PICtrl[SAT]): (1)
There will be errors in the estimate of ESS from the above
equation; for example, the equation assumes that the sen-
sitivity to CO 2is linear, which may not necessarily be the
case. Further errors will occur because of changes between
Plio Core and PI Ctrlwhich should not be included in esti-
mates of ESS, such as land–sea mask changes, topographic
changes, changes in soil properties and lake changes. How-
ever, all these additional changes are likely minimal com-
pared to the ice sheet and greenhouse gas (GHG) changes and
are expected to have only a negligible impact on the glob-
ally averaged temperature and therefore the estimate of ESS.
For example, Pound et al. (2014) found that the inclusion of
Pliocene soils and lake distributions in a climate model had
an insigniﬁcant effect on global temperature (even though
changes regionally could be important).
To assess the relationship across the ensemble between the
reported ECS and the modelled ESS, we correlate reported
ECS across the ensemble with the associated Plio Core–PICtrl
temperature anomalies. We do this on global, zonal mean

tion would suggest that MP proxy data at that location could
be used to derive proxy-data-constrained estimate of ECS
(similar to an emergent constraint), while a weak correlation
would suggest that proxy data at that location could not be
used in ECS estimates.
3 Climate results
3.1 Surface air temperature (SAT)
Figure 1a shows the global mean surface air temperature
(SAT) for each model. The top panel shows the Plio Core
and PI CtrlSATs, while the lower panel shows the anomaly
between them. In this and all subsequent ﬁgures, the mod-
els are ordered by ECS (see Table 2) such that the model
with the highest published ECS (i.e. CESM2; ECS D5:3)
is shown on the left, while the model with the lowest pub-
lished ECS (i.e. NorESM1-F; ECS D2:3) is on the right.
Increases in Plio Core global annual mean SATs, compared
to each of the contributing models PI Ctrlexperiment, range
from 1.7 to 5.2C (Fig. 1a; Table 2) with an ensemble
mean1Tof 3.2C. The multi-model median 1Tis 3.0C,
while the 10th and 90th percentiles are 2.1 and 4.8C re-
spectively. Analogous results from individual models of the
PlioMIP1 ensemble are shown by the horizontal grey lines in
Fig. 1a and have a mean warming of 2.7C. Pliocene warm-ing for individual PlioMIP1 models falls into two distinct
anomaly bands that are 1.8–2.2C (CCSM4, GISS-E2-R, IP-
SLCM5A, MRI2.2) and 3.2–3.6C (COSMOS, HadCM3,
MIROC4m, NorESM-L). PlioMIP2 shows a greater range
of responses than PlioMIP1, and PlioMIP2 results are more
evenly scattered over the ensemble range. The ensemble
mean temperature anomaly is larger in PlioMIP2 than in
PlioMIP1 because of the addition of new and more sensi-
tive models to PlioMIP2 rather than being due to the change
in boundary conditions between PlioMIP1 and PlioMIP2.
PlioMIP2 shows increased SATs over the whole globe
(Fig. 1b) with an ensemble average warming of 2:0C for
the tropical oceans (20N–20S), which increases towards
the high latitudes (Fig. 1b, c). Multi-model mean SAT warm-
ing can exceed 12C in Bafﬁn Bay and 7C in the Green-
land Sea (Fig. 1b), a result potentially inﬂuenced by the clo-
sure of the Canadian Archipelago and Bering Strait, as well
as by the speciﬁed loss of most of the Greenland Ice Sheet
(GIS) and the simulated reduction in Northern Hemisphere
sea-ice cover (de Nooijer et al., 2020). In the Southern Hemi-
sphere, warming is pronounced in regions of Antarctica that
were deglaciated in the MP in both west and east Antarctica
(Fig. 1b). Warming in the interior of east Antarctica is lim-
ited by the prescribed topography of the MP East Antarctic
Ice Sheet (EAIS), which in some places exceeds the topog-
raphy of the EAIS in the models’ PI Ctrlexperiments.

In terms of magnitude, the CESM2 model has the great-
est apparent sensitivity to imposing MP boundary conditions
with a simulated 1Tof 5.2C (Fig. 1a). This model was pub-
lished in 2020 and has the highest ECS of all the PlioMIP2
models. This model was not included in PlioMIP1, and its
response to Pliocene boundary conditions lies outside the
range of all PlioMIP1 models both in global mean and for
every latitude band (Fig. 1a, c). It is also warmer than the
PlioMIP2 multi-model mean in nearly all grid boxes (Fig. S1
in the Supplement). Other particularly sensitive models (EC-
Earth3.3, CESM1.2, CCSM4-Utr and CCSM4-UoT; shown
as an anomaly from the multi-model mean in Fig. S1) are
also new to PlioMIP2, and this explains why the simulated
1Tfrom PlioMIP2 exceeds that from PlioMIP1. The model
with the lowest response to PlioMIP2 boundary conditionsis the NorESM1-F model, which is also the model with the
lowest published ECS. Although there is clearly some cor-
relation between a model’s ECS and its Plio Core–PICtltem-
perature anomaly, the relationship is not exact. In particular,
the versions of CCSM4 that were run by Utrecht University
(CCSM4-Utr) and the University of Toronto (CCSM-UoT)
both show a large Pliocene response but have a modest ECS
compared to the other models.
Three different versions of CCSM4 contributed to
PlioMIP2 (see Table 1): the standard version run at the Na-
tional Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) (hereafter
referred to as CCSM) has a simulated 1TD2:6C, while
CCSM4-Utr has a simulated 1TD4:7C, and CCSM4-
UoT has a simulated 1TD3:8C. A notable difference be-
tween these simulations is the response in the 60–90S band

where the mean warming in the CCSM4-Utr simulation is
4C higher than in the CCSM4-UoT simulation and 6.6C
higher than in the CCSM4 simulation (Figs. 1c, S1). Table S1
shows that, even though the CCSM4 models differ in their
response, they all appear to be close to equilibrium. In ad-
dition, they are all reported to have similar ECSs (Table 1),
and they all have the same physics apart from changes to
the standard ocean model in the CCSM4-UoT simulations
and the Plio CoreCCSM4-Utr simulation. These changes (dis-
cussed by Chandan and Peltier, 2017, this special issue) are
as follows: (1) the vertical proﬁle of background diapycnal
mixing has been ﬁxed to a hyperbolic tangent form, and
(2) tidal mixing and dense water overﬂow parameterization
schemes have been turned off. Although the exact cause of
the differences in 1Tbetween the CCSM4 models remains
unclear, the changes in the ocean parameterizations and dif-
ferences in initialization may contribute to the 1T differ-
ences, in particular the changes in ocean mixing between dif-
ferent versions of the model (Fedorov et al., 2010).
Analysis of the standard deviation of the model ensem-
ble (Fig. 1d) indicates that models are generally consistent
in terms of the magnitude of temperature response in the
tropics, especially over the oceans. However, they can dif-
fer markedly in the higher latitudes where the inter-model
standard deviation reaches more than 4.5C.
To evaluate whether the multi-model mean Plio Core–PICtrl
anomaly at a grid box is “robust” we follow the methodology
of Mba et al. (2018) and Nikulin et al. (2018). The anomaly
is said to be robust if two conditions are fulﬁlled: (1) at least
80 % models agree on the sign of the anomaly, and (2) the
signal-to-noise ratio (i.e. the ratio of the size of the mean
anomaly to the inter-model standard deviation; Fig. 1b, d) is
Figure 2. Plio Core–PICtrlSAT multi-model mean anomaly. Grid
boxes where at least 80 % of the models agree on the sign of the
change are marked “ =”. Grid boxes where the ratio of the multi-
model mean SAT change to the PI Ctrlintermodel standard devia-
tion is greater than 1 are marked “ n”. Grid boxes where both these
conditions are satisﬁed show a robust signal.
greater than or equal to 1. Regions where the SAT anomaly
is considered robust according to these criteria are hatched
in Fig. 2. It is seen that for SAT the Plio Core–PICtrlanomaly
is considered robust across the ensemble over nearly all the
globe.

3.2 Seasonal cycle of surface air temperature, land–sea
temperature contrasts and polar ampliﬁcation
The Northern Hemisphere (NH) averaged SAT anomaly over
the seasonal cycle is presented in Fig. 3a. Overall, the en-
semble mean anomaly (dashed black line) is fairly constant
throughout the year; however, models within the ensemble
have very different characteristics in terms of the monthly
and seasonal distribution of the warming. Some members of
the ensemble have a relatively ﬂat seasonal cycle in 1SAT
(e.g. NorESM-L, NorESM1-F, COSMOS); however, others
show a very strong seasonal cycle. The models that show
a very strong seasonal cycle do not agree on the timing of
the peak warming. For example, EC-Earth3.3 has the peak
warming in October, CESM2 has peak warming in July, and
MRI2.3 has peak warming in January/February. The lack
of consistency in the seasonal signal of warming has in-
teresting implications in terms of whether PlioMIP2 out-
puts could be used to examine the potential for seasonal
bias in proxy datasets. To do this meaningfully would re-
quire clear consistency in model seasonal responses, which
is absent in the PlioMIP2 ensemble. The grey shaded area
in Fig. 3a shows the range of NH temperature responses in
PlioMIP1, with the PlioMIP1 ensemble average shown by
the dotted black line. Although the ensemble average from
both PlioMIP2 and PlioMIP1 shows a relatively ﬂat seasonal
cycle, the range of responses is very different between the
two ensembles. PlioMIP1 predicted a large range of tem-
perature responses in the NH winter, which reduced in the
summer. In PlioMIP2, however, the summer range is ampli-
ﬁed compared to the winter. Indeed 7 of the 16 PlioMIP2
models show a NH summer temperature anomaly that is no-
ticeably above that seen in any of the PlioMIP1 simulations.
Some of these models (CESM2, EC-Earth3.3, CCSM4-Utr,
CCSM4-UoT and CESM1.2) did not contribute to PlioMIP1,
which shows that whichever models are included in an en-
semble can strongly affect the ensemble response. However,
other models (MIROC4m and HadCM3) that show an en-
hanced summer response in PlioMIP2 were also included in
PlioMIP1, showing that there is also an impact of the change
in boundary conditions on seasonal temperature. None of
the PlioMIP2 models replicate the lowest warming seen in
December–February (DJF) in the PlioMIP1 ensemble; this
lowest value was derived from the GISS-E2-R model in
PlioMIP1 which did not contribute to PlioMIP2.
The ensemble results for land–sea temperature contrasts
clearly indicate a greater warming over land than over the
oceans (Fig. 3b). This result also holds when only the land–
sea temperature contrast in the tropics is considered. The land
ampliﬁcation factor is similar in PlioMIP2 and PlioMIP1,
and models in both ensembles cluster near a land ampliﬁca-
tion factor of1:5. There is also no relationship between a
model’s climate sensitivity and the land ampliﬁcation factor.
The multi-model median (10th percentile/90th percentile)warming over the land and ocean is 4.5C (2.6C/6.1C)
and 2.5C (1.9C/4.4C) respectively.
The extratropical NH (45–90N) warms more than the ex-
tratropical Southern Hemisphere (SH) (45–90S) in 5 of the
8 models (62 %) from PlioMIP1 and in 11 of the 16 mod-
els (69 %) from PlioMIP2 (Fig. 3c). This shows that neither
the change in boundary conditions nor the addition of newer
models to PlioMIP2 affects the ensemble proportion of en-
hanced NH warming; nor does the published ECS have any
obvious impact on whether the warming is concentrated in
the NH or the SH. The models that indicate greater SH ver-
sus NH warming (CCSM4-Utr, GISS2.1G, NorESM-L) are
among those that have weaker differences between land and
ocean warming (Fig. 3b).
Polar ampliﬁcation (PA) can be deﬁned as the ratio of po-
lar warming (poleward of 60in each hemisphere) to global
mean warming (Smith et al., 2019). The PA for each model
for the NH and the SH is shown in Fig. 3d. All models
show PA>1 for both hemispheres, although whether there
is more PA in the NH or SH is a model-dependent fea-
ture. The ensemble mean (median) PA is 2.3 (2.2) in both
the NH and the SH, suggesting that across the ensemble
PA is hemispherically symmetrical. This result is very sim-
ilar to PlioMIP1 (not shown), which suggests that the en-
hanced warming in the PlioMIP2 ensemble does not affect
the PA. For PlioMIP2, the NH median PA is 2.2 with the
10th and 90th percentiles at 1.9 and 2.8 respectively, while in
the SH the median PA is 2.2, with the 10th and 90th per-
centiles at 1.8 and 3.1 respectively. Polar ampliﬁcation is
lower over the land than the ocean (Fig. S2) in both hemi-
spheres. The NH mean (10th =50th=90th percentiles) PAs
are 1.6 (1:4=1:6=1:9) and 2.7 (2:4=2:7=3:3) over the land and
ocean respectively, while the SH mean (10th =50th=90th
percentiles) PAs are 0.9 (0 :5=0:8=1:5) and 1.9 (1:1=1:9=2:5)
over the land and ocean respectively. Note that in the SH to-
tal PA is higher than both land and ocean PAs because of the
change in the area of land between the Plio Coreand PI Cntlex-
periments. There appears to be a weak relationship between
the PA factor and a model’s ECS. Those models which have
a lower published ECS (those to the right of Fig. 3d) have a
tendency towards a higher PA. This is not because these mod-
els have excess warming at high latitudes, but rather these
models have less tropical warming than other models.
3.3 Meridional/zonal SST gradients in the Paciﬁc and
Atlantic
There has been great interest in the reconstruction of
Pliocene SST gradients in the Atlantic and Paciﬁc to pro-
vide ﬁrst order assessments of Pliocene climate change and
to assess possible mechanisms of Pliocene temperature en-
hancement and ocean–atmospheric dynamic responses (Rind
and Chandler, 1991). For example, the meridional gradient in
the Atlantic has been discussed in terms of the potential for
enhanced ocean heat transport in the Pliocene (e.g. Dowsett

et al., 1992). In addition, the zonal SST gradient across the
tropical Paciﬁc has been used to examine the potential for
change in Walker Circulation and, through this, El Niño–
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dynamics and teleconnection
patterns during the Pliocene (Fedorov et al., 2013; Burls and
Fedorov, 2014; Tierney et al., 2019).
The multi-model mean meridional proﬁle of zonal mean
SSTs in the Atlantic Ocean is shown in Fig. 4a. In the trop-
ics and subtropics, the SST increase between the Plio Coreand
PICtrlexperiments is 1.5–2.5C. This difference increases to
5:0C in the NH at55N with an inter-model range
of 2–11C. The Pliocene and pre-industrial meridional SST
proﬁle in the Paciﬁc (Fig. 4b) is similar to that of the Atlantic
but with little indication from the multi-model mean for a
high-latitude enhancement in meridional temperature. How-ever, a large range in the ensemble response is noted, and
the importance of an adjustment of the vertical mixing pa-
rameterization towards the simulation of a reduced Pliocene
meridional gradient has recently been shown (Lohmann et
al., 2020).
In the tropical Atlantic (20N–20S), the multi-model
mean zonal mean SST for the Pliocene increases by 1:9C
(ensemble range from 0.8 to 3–4C) with a ﬂat zonal tem-
perature gradient across the tropical Atlantic (Fig. 4c). In the
tropical Paciﬁc, both Pliocene and pre-industrial ensembles
clearly show the signature of both a western Paciﬁc warm
pool and the relatively cool waters in the eastern Paciﬁc that
are associated with upwelling (Fig. 4d). As such, a clear east–
west temperature gradient is evident in the Pliocene tropical
Paciﬁc in the PlioMIP2 ensemble (similar to PlioMIP1) and
https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-2095-2020 Clim. Past, 16, 2095–2123, 20202106 A. M. Haywood et al.: Pliocene climate and climate sensitivity
Figure 4. Panels (a, b) show the zonally averaged SST over the Atlantic region (70W–0E) and the Paciﬁc region (150E–100W)
respectively. Panels (c, d) show the SST averaged between 20N and 20S for the Atlantic and Paciﬁc respectively. In all ﬁgures, blue

is not consistent with a permanent El Niño (see Fig. S3). The
PlioMIP2 ensemble supports a recent proxy-derived recon-
struction for the Paciﬁc that found Pliocene ocean tempera-
tures increased in both the eastern and western tropical Pa-
ciﬁc (Tierney et al., 2019).
Using the methodology of Mba et al. (2018) and Nikulin et
al. (2018), the signal of SST change seen in the multi-model
mean is robust over nearly all ocean grid cells (Fig. S4).
Figure S3 shows the difference between the Pliocene 1SST
for each model in the PlioMIP2 ensemble and the Pliocene
1SST of the multi-model mean. This illustrates that, despite
the climate anomaly being larger than the inter-model stan-
dard deviation, there are still many regions (e.g. Southern
Ocean, North Atlantic Ocean, Arctic Ocean) where there is a
notable inter-model spread of the magnitude of the Pliocene
SST anomalies.
3.4 Total precipitation rate
Simulated increases in Plio Coreglobal annual mean precipi-
tation rates compared to each contributing model’s PI Ctrlex-
periment (hereafter referred to as 1Precip) range from 0.07
to 0.37 mm d 1(Fig. 5a), which is notably larger than the
PlioMIP1 range of 0.09–0.18 mm d 1(shown as horizontal
grey lines in Fig. 5a). The PlioMIP2 ensemble mean 1Precip
is 0.19 mm d 1. The increase in the globally averaged pre-cipitation anomaly in PlioMIP2 is due to the addition of new
models to the ensemble which have high ECS and are also
more sensitive to the PlioMIP2 boundary conditions. Mod-
els that were included in PlioMIP1 (COSMOS, IPSLCM5A,
MIROC4m, HadCM3, CCSM4, NorESM-L and MRI2.3)
show PlioMIP2 precipitation anomalies that are similar to
PlioMIP1 results. The spatial pattern (Fig. 5b) shows en-
hanced precipitation over high latitudes and reduced precip-
itation over parts of the subtropics. The largest 1Precip is
found in the tropics in regions of the world that are domi-
nated by the monsoons (west Africa, India, East Asia). The
enhancement in precipitation over northern Africa is con-
sistent with previous Pliocene modelling results that have
demonstrated a weakening in Hadley circulation linked to a
reduced pole-to-Equator temperature gradient (e.g. Corvec
and Fletcher, 2017). Greenland shows increased Plio Core
precipitation in regions that have become deglaciated and
are therefore substantially warmer. Latitudes associated with
the westerly wind belts also show enhanced Plio Core pre-
cipitation with an indication of a poleward shift in higher-
latitude precipitation. This result is consistent with ﬁndings
from PlioMIP1 (Li et al., 2015). Other, more locally de-
ﬁned examples of 1Precip appear closely linked to local-
ized variations in Pliocene topography and land–sea mask
changes, for example, the Sahul and Sunda shelves that be-
Clim. Past, 16, 2095–2123, 2020 https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-2095-2020A. M. Haywood et al.: Pliocene climate and climate sensitivity 2107
come subaerial in the Plio Core experiment. In general, the
models that display the largest SAT sensitivity to the pre-
scription of Pliocene boundary conditions also display the
largest1Precip (CESM2, CCSM4-Utr, EC-Earth3.3). This
is consistent with a warmer atmosphere leading to a greater
moisture carrying capacity and therefore greater evaporation
and precipitation. The model showing the least sensitivity in
terms of precipitation response is GISS2.1G.
Analysis of the standard deviation within the ensemble
demonstrates that, in contrast to SAT, models are most con-
sistent regarding 1Precip in the extratropics (Fig. 5c). This is
similar to the ﬁndings of PlioMIP1 (Haywood et al., 2013a)
and is likely because more precipitation falls in the trop-
ics than extratropics, and therefore the inter-model differ-
ences are larger in the tropics. The methodology of Mba et
al. (2018) and Nikulin et al. (2018) (described in Sect. 3.1)
was used to determine the robustness of 1Precip (Fig. 5d).
Unlike the temperature signal, which was robust through-
out most of the globe, there are large regions in the trop-
ics and subtropics where the ensemble precipitation signal
is uncertain. Changes in precipitation rates in the subtrop-
ics have some inter-model coherence in many places because
at least 80 % of models agree on the sign of change. How-
ever, most of these predicted changes are not robust because
the magnitude of change is not large compared to the stan-
dard deviation seen in the ensemble (Fig. 5c). This is con-
sistent with results from CMIP5, which show that predicted
precipitation changes have low conﬁdence particularly in the
low and medium emissions scenarios (IPCC, 2013). The sig-
nal of precipitation change is determined to be robust in the
high latitudes and in the middle latitudes in regions inﬂu-
enced by the westerlies. This is also the case in regions in-
ﬂuenced by the west African, Indian and East Asian summer
monsoons (Fig. 5d). Figure S5 shows the difference between
each model’s 1Precip and the multi-model mean 1Precip
(shown in Fig. 5b), highlighting that there is uncertainty in
the ensemble with respect to the regional patterns of precipi-
tation change.
3.5 Seasonal cycle of total precipitation and land–sea
precipitation contrasts
Figure 6a shows the seasonal cycle of the precipitation
anomaly averaged over the Northern Hemisphere. As was
the case for SAT, the monthly and seasonal distribution of
precipitation anomalies is highly model dependent, although
the ensemble average shows a clear NH late spring to au-
tumn Plio Coreenhancement in precipitation (Fig. 6a). This is
most strongly evident in the models CESM2, EC-Earth3.3
and CCSM4-Utr; however, it is also evident in other models.
Some models show a different seasonal cycle to the ensem-
ble mean, for example, the GISS2.1G model, which simu-
lates the NH late spring to autumn 1Precip being suppressed
compared to the rest of the year, and HadCM3, which has a
bimodal distribution. An increase in NH summer precipita-tion is consistent with a general trend of west African, Indian
and East Asian summer monsoon enhancement, and this will
be discussed in detail in a forthcoming PlioMIP2 paper. In
PlioMIP1 (ensemble average – dotted black line and model
range – grey shaded area in Fig. 6a), the seasonal cycle in
precipitation was much more muted. PlioMIP1 results in bo-
real winter are similar to PlioMIP2; however, the mean pre-
cipitation anomaly in PlioMIP2 between June and Novem-
ber is 40 % larger than PlioMIP1. This increase is mainly
due to the inclusion of new and more sensitive models into
PlioMIP2 (e.g. CESM2 and EC-Earth3.3). However, some
models with enhanced summer precipitation (e.g. COSMOS)
contributed to both PlioMIP1 and PlioMIP2, suggesting a
role of boundary condition changes in enhancing the NH bo-
real summer precipitation. It is noted, however, that not all
the new models in PlioMIP2 show enhanced summer precipi-
tation relative to PlioMIP1. The GISS2.1G model, which was
new to PlioMIP2, shows the most muted summer precipita-
tion response in the NH in all PlioMIP2 and PlioMIP1 mod-
els. This means that the range of summer–autumn NH precip-
itation responses as shown by the ensemble increases signif-
icantly in PlioMIP2. For example, PlioMIP1 showed a NH
precipitation response in October to be 0.13–0.42 mm d 1,
while in PlioMIP2 this has increased to 0.05–0.70 mm d 1.
In terms of the land–sea 1Precip contrast, the PlioMIP2
ensemble divides into two groups (Fig. 6b), one in which a
clear pattern of precipitation anomaly enhancement over land
compared to the oceans is seen (EC-Earth3.3, MIROC4m,
HadCM3, CCSM4, CCSM4-Utr, CCSM4-UoT, NorESM-
L and NorESM-F) and the other in which there is ei-
ther a small or no enhancement in the land versus oceans
(CESM2, IPSLCM6A, COSMOS, CESM1.2, IPSLCM5A,
IPSLCM5A2, GISS2.1G and MRI2.3). Models which show
the greatest precipitation enhancement over the land are gen-
erally those which have a lower published ECS (those to the
right of Fig. 6b) and a small precipitation response over the
oceans but a land precipitation anomaly similar to other mod-
els. Models with a higher ECS (e.g. CESM2) show a similar
precipitation anomaly over the land and ocean. The horizon-
tal grey lines in Fig. 6b show the land–sea 1Precip ampliﬁca-
tion for the PlioMIP1 models. None of the PlioMIP1 models
have a1Precip ampliﬁcation factor >2; however, half of the
PlioMIP2 models do. Further, four models which contributed
to both PlioMIP1 and PlioMIP2 (MIROC4m, HadCM3,
CCSM4, NorESM-L) have a much greater land ampliﬁcation
in PlioMIP2, showing that the change in boundary conditions
strongly affects this diagnostic.
3.6 Climate and Earth system sensitivity
This section will consider the relationship between ECS and
ESS across the ensemble. Table 2 shows the ECS for each
model (referenced in Table 1) and the ESS estimated from the
Plio Core–PICtrltemperature anomaly (Eq. 1). Since ice sheet
changes were prescribed, there will be no transient response

due to ice sheet changes, and the Plio Core experiment will
be in equilibrium with the ice sheets. The mean ESS =ECS
ratio is 1.67, suggesting that the ESS based on the ensem-
ble is 67 % larger than the ECS; however, the range is large
with the GISS2.1G model suggesting that the ESS =ECS ra-
tio is 1.22, while the CCSM4_Utr model suggests that the
ESS=ECS ratio is 2.85.
The ﬁrst analysis of how ECS relates to ESS will con-
sider the correlation between ECS and the globally averaged
Plio Core–PICtrltemperature anomaly. This is seen in Fig. 7a,
and each cross represents the results from a different model
in the PlioMIP2 ensemble. There is a signiﬁcant relationship
between ECS and the Plio Core–PICtrltemperature anomaly
at the 95 % conﬁdence level ( pD0:01,R2D0:35) with the
line of best ﬁt being ECS D2:3C(0:44(Plio Core(SAT) 
PICtrl(SAT))).Next, we investigate whether there is a correlation across
the ensemble between ECS and the Plio Core–PICtrlSAT
anomaly on spatial scales. In the analysis that follows, we
will simply assess whether such a correlation exists and, if
so, how strong it is by looking at pvalues andR-squared
values calculated from the models in the ensemble. Figure 7b
shows the relationship ( pvalue – blue, Rsquared – red)
across the ensemble between modelled ECS and the mod-
elled zonal mean Plio Core–PICtrlSAT anomaly. We ﬁnd a sig-
niﬁcant relationship ( p<0:05) between ECS and the zonal
mean Pliocene temperature anomaly throughout most of the
tropics. This relationship becomes signiﬁcant at the 99 %
conﬁdence level ( p<0:01) between 38N and 27S, where
a high proportion of the inter-model variability in global ECS
can be related to the inter-model variability in the Pliocene

SAT anomaly at an individual latitude, reaching a maximum
of 65 % at15N.
Next the relationship between global ECS and the local
Plio Core–PICtrlSAT anomaly is assessed. In Fig. 7c, colours
show theR-squared correlation across the ensemble be-
tween modelled global ECS and the modelled local Plio Core–
PICtrlSAT anomaly. The regions where the relationship be-
tween the two is signiﬁcant at the 95 % conﬁdence level
are hatched. The relationship between ECS and the local
Plio Core–PICtrlSAT anomaly is signiﬁcant over most of the
tropics and over some middle- and high-latitude regions in-
cluding Greenland and parts of Antarctica. In many cases, the
tropical oceans show a temperature anomaly more strongly
related to ECS than the land, although this is not always the
case.
4 Data–model comparison
Haywood et al. (2013a, b) proposed that the proxy data and
climate model comparison in PlioMIP1 could include dis-
crepancies owing to the comparison between time averaged
PRISM3D SST and SAT data and climate model represen-
tations of a single time slice. In order to improve the in-
tegrity of the data–model comparisons in PlioMIP2, Foley
and Dowsett (2019) synthesized alkenone SST data that can
be conﬁdently attributed to the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS)
KM5c time slice that experiment Plio Coreis designed to rep-
resent. Foley and Dowsett (2019) provide two different SST
datasets. One dataset includes all SST data for an interval of
10 000 years around the time slice (5000 years to either side
of the peak of MIS KM5c), and the other covers 30 000 years
(up to 15 000 years to either side of the peak; this latterdataset will hereafter be referred to as F&D19_30). Age
models used in the compilation are those originally released
with the datasets, but later modiﬁcations of age models or
the integration of additional data could result in mean SST
values different from those reported in F&D19_30. All SST
estimates are calibrated using Müller et al. (1998). Prescott
et al. (2014) demonstrated that due to the speciﬁc nature of
orbital forcing 20 000 years before and after the peak of MIS
KM5c, age and site correlation uncertainty within that in-
terval would be unlikely to introduce signiﬁcant errors into
SST-based DMC. Given this and in order to maximize the
number of ocean sites where SST can be derived, we carry
out a point-based SST data–model comparison using the
F&D19_30 dataset.
We compare the multi-model mean SST anomaly to a
proxy SST anomaly created by differencing the F&D19_30
dataset from observed pre-industrial SSTs derived for years
1870–1899 of the NOAA Extended Reconstructed Sea Sur-
face Temperature (ERSST) version 5 dataset (Huang et
al., 2017; Fig. 8a and b). Figure 8c shows the proxy data
1SST minus the multi-model mean 1SST. Using the multi-
model mean results, 17 of the 37 sites show a difference in
data–model1SST of no greater than 1C (Fig. 8c). These
are located mostly in the tropics but also include sites in the
North Atlantic, along the coastal regions of California and
New Zealand, and in the North Paciﬁc. In terms of discrep-
ancies, the clearest and most consistent signal comes from
the Benguela upwelling system (off the south-west coast of
Africa) where the multi-model mean does not predict the
scale of warming seen in three of the four proxy reconstruc-
tions. The multi-model mean is insufﬁciently sensitive in the
two Mediterranean Sea sites, along the east coast of North

America (Yorktown Formation) and at one location west of
Svalbard close to the sea-ice margin. The multi-model mean
predicts a warming that is too great at one location off the
Florida and Norwegian coasts. No discernible spatial pattern
or structure is seen (outside of the Benguela and Mediter-
ranean regions) for sites where the ensemble underestimates
or overestimates the magnitude of SST change.
Comparing model-predicted and proxy-based absolute
SST estimates for the MIS KM5c time slice (Fig. 8d) yields
a similar outcome to the comparison of SST anomalies
(Fig. 8c). However, the Benguela region shows greater data–
model agreement when considering absolute SSTs than when
considering anomalies. Furthermore, a somewhat clearer pic-
ture emerges of the model ensemble not producing SSTs that
are warm enough in the higher latitudes of the North Atlantic,
in the position of the modern North Atlantic gyre and espe-
cially in the Nordic Sea, although this appears site dependant
as the ensemble overestimates absolute SSTs near Scandi-
navia.The proxy data 1SST minus the mean 1SST for indi-
vidual models is shown in Fig. S6. In regions where there
was a strong discrepancy between the proxy data 1SST and
the multi-model mean 1SST, none of the individual models
show good data–model agreement. The EC-Earth3.3 model
shows an improved agreement with the data in the Mediter-
ranean, the Benguela upwelling system, the site along the
east coast of North America and the site to the west of Sval-
bard. However, this improved data–model agreement is at
the expense of reduced data–model agreement elsewhere;
many of the low- and middle-latitude sites which had good
data–model agreement for the multi-model mean have re-
duced data–model agreement in EC-Earth3.3. Other mod-
els which showed great warming in PlioMIP2 (i.e. CESM2
and CCSM4-Utr) also show a larger 1SST than the data
for some of the tropical- and middle-latitude sites which
were in good agreement with the multi-model mean. Mod-
els that were less sensitive to Pliocene boundary conditions
(i.e. GISS2.1G and NorESM-L) do not predict the amount of

warming seen in the data for some of the North Atlantic sites,
and the multi-model means performs better. Table 3 shows
statistics for the data–model comparison for both individual
models and the multi-model mean. The root mean square er-
ror (RMSE) between the model and the data is 3.72 for the
multi-model mean but is lower in some individual models
(namely CESM2, IPSLCM6A, EC-Earth3.3, CESM1.2 and
CCSM4-UoT). In general, those models that have a lower
data–model RMSE are those which have a higher ECS and
a higher Plio Core–PICtrlwarming, while less sensitive models
have a higher model data RMSE. The average difference be-
tween the data and model across all the data points shows a
similar pattern. The proxy data are on average 1.5C warmer
than the multi-model mean. However, some individual mod-
els have a much smaller average data–model discrepancy
(e.g. CESM2D 0:18C). The models with a lower data–
model discrepancy are those which also have a lower data–
model RMSE and have higher than average Plio Core–PICtl
warming.
This initial analysis suggests that the most sensitive mod-
els agree better with the proxy data than the less sensitive
models. However, further analysis does not fully support
this result. If we consider how many of the 37 sites have“good” data–model agreement, a different picture emerges.
Table 3 shows how many sites have model 1SST within 2,
1 and 0.5C of the data 1SST. Using these diagnostics, the
multi-model mean (MMM) performs better than any of the
16 individual models. Those models which have the low-
est RMSE and the best average data–model agreement are
not those models which have the largest number of sites
where model and data agree. For example, CESM2 and EC-
Earth3.3 have a particularly low number of sites with good
data–model agreement. The models with the highest num-
ber of sites with data–model agreements (e.g. ISPLCM6A,
CCSM4-UoT, MIROC4m and CESM1.2) show a Plio Core–
PICtlwarming that is closer to the MMM. The fact that
the MMM has more sites with “good” data–model agree-
ment than any individual model highlights the beneﬁt of per-
forming a large multi-model ensemble as we have done for
PlioMIP2. It allows inherent biases within individual mod-
els to cancel out and likely provides a more accurate way of
estimating climate anomalies than can be done with a single
model.

mean SAT anomalies (Fig. S7b; 1SATD(1:161SST)C

5 Discussion
5.1 Large-scale features of a warmer climate (palaeo
versus future, older versus younger models)
The range in the global annual mean 1SAT shown by the
PlioMIP2 ensemble (from 1.7 to 5.2C) is akin to the best
estimate (and uncertainty bounds) of predicted global tem-
perature change by 2100 CE using the RCP4.5 (Represen-
tative Concentration Pathway) to 8.5 scenarios (RCP4.5 D
1:80:5C and RCP8.5D3:70:7C; IPCC, 2013; Ta-
ble 12.2). Comparing the degree of Pliocene temperature
change to predicted changes at 2300 CE, the multi-model
mean SAT change is between RCP4.5 (2 :50:6C) and
RCP6.0 (4:21:0C).
Studies have suggested that the Arctic temperature re-
sponse to a doubling of atmospheric CO 2concentration
may be 1–3 times that of the global annual mean temper-
ature response (Hind et al., 2016). All 16 models withinthe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulate a polar ampliﬁcation factor
(PA; averaged over the NH and SH) between 2 and 3 (mean-
ing that the high-latitude temperature increase is 2–3 times
the global mean temperature increase); however, two mod-
els (GISS2.1G and NorESM-L) show PA >3 in the SH. An
important caveat to note in the comparison between Pliocene
and future predicted polar ampliﬁcation factors is the major
changes in the size of the ice sheets, which in terms of area-
of-ice difference affect the SH far more than the NH.
Both model simulations and observations (Byrne and
O’Gorman, 2013) show that as temperatures rise, the land
warms more than the oceans. This is due to differential
lapse rates linked to moisture availability on land. From a
theoretical standpoint, the difference in land–sea warming
is expected to be monotonic with increases in temperature.
However, in reality the rise is non-monotonic and is regu-
lated by latitudinal and regional variations in the availabil-
ity of soil moisture that inﬂuences lapse rates (Byrne and
O’Gorman, 2013). This is evident in the PlioMIP2 ensem-
ble with the land–sea ampliﬁcation of warming noted more
strongly in the global mean than in the tropics where precip-
itation is most abundant (Fig. 3b). For perturbations to the
pre-industrial era, modelling and observational studies have
shown that land warms 30 % to 70 % more than the oceans
(Lambert and Webb, 2011). The PlioMIP2 ensemble broadly
supports this conclusion and previous work. It also supports
studies that have indicated that the land–sea warming con-
trast is not dependent upon whether we are considering a
Clim. Past, 16, 2095–2123, 2020 https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-2095-2020A. M. Haywood et al.: Pliocene climate and climate sensitivity 2113
transient (RCP-like) or an equilibrium-type climate change
scenario (e.g. Lambert and Webb, 2011).
In predictions of future climate change, a consistent re-
sult from models is that the warming signal is ampliﬁed in
the Northern compared to Southern Hemisphere in the ex-
tratropics. There have been several studies which have pro-
posed mechanisms to explain this, including heat uptake by
the Southern Ocean (Stouffer et al., 1989), as well as ocean
heat transport mechanisms (Russell et al., 2006). Within the
PlioMIP2 ensemble, 11 out of 16 models show a larger tem-
perature change in the NH extratropics than the SH extrat-
ropics (Fig. 3c). This can in part be explained by the area
of land in the NH being larger than in the SH and the al-
ready discussed ampliﬁcation of warming over the land ver-
sus the oceans. However, the degree of difference is highly
model dependent and not as large as has been reported for
simulations of future climate change by the Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013). This may
be linked to the intrinsic difference in response between a
RCP-like transient and equilibrium climate experiment and
in the Pliocene’s substantially reduced ice sheets in Antarc-
tica, which are not speciﬁed in future climate change simu-
lations. Hence, the noted hemispheric difference in warming
for the future may simply be a transient feature that would
not be sustained as the ice sheets in Antarctica respond to the
warming over centennial to millennial timescales.
The 3.2C increase in multi-model mean temperature is
associated with a 7 % increase in global annual mean precip-
itation. According to the Clausius–Clapeyron equation, the
water holding capacity of the atmosphere increases by about
7 % for each 1C of temperature increase. The increase in
precipitation is therefore less than would be expected if it
were assumed that all aspects of the hydrological cycle re-
mained the same as in the pre-industrial era. This is in line
with model simulations of future climate change linked to
greater temperatures enhancing evaporation from the surface
and the atmosphere having a greater moisture carrying capac-
ity but sluggish moisture convection (Held and Soden, 2006).
A particularly robust feature across the ensemble is an in-
crease in precipitation over the modern Sahara Desert and
over the Asian monsoon region (Fig. 5d). These regions also
experience enhanced precipitation under the RCP8.5 sce-
nario for 2100 (IPCC, 2013, and Fig. SPM.8 therein). How-
ever, in other tropical and subtropical regions, the Plio Core
model response is small compared to the pre-industrial inter-
model standard deviation.
Corvec and Fletcher (2017) showed that in PlioMIP1
studies, the tropical overturning circulations in the MP
were weaker than pre-industrial simulations, while Sun et
al. (2013) showed that both Hadley cells expanded pole-
wards, a result consistent with (but weaker than) the RCP4.5
scenario. These changes in circulation are consistent with the
expansion of the subtropical highs and the corresponding re-
duction in subtropical oceanic precipitation seen in Fig. 5 forthe Plio Coreensemble and in the IPCC (2013; Fig. 7) for RCP
scenarios at year 2100.
Although there are many similarities in tropical atmo-
spheric circulation response between Pliocene experiments
and the RCP future climate change experiments, there are
speciﬁc differences mainly relating to (a) the ice sheet
changes and their effects on the Equator-to-pole temperature
gradient during the Pliocene vis-à-vis the future and (b) the
ﬁxed versus transient GHG changes. Nonetheless, the simi-
larities between the general features of the Pliocene experi-
ments and future experiments continue to support the use of
the Pliocene as one of the best geological analogues for the
near future (Burke et al., 2018) despite the different boundary
conditions.
It has been seen that some of the main differences between
the PlioMIP1 and PlioMIP2 ensembles are due to the inclu-
sion of new models in PlioMIP2 that were not available at the
time of PlioMIP1. This suggests that recent developments in
model physics lead to altered responses to Pliocene boundary
conditions. For example, PlioMIP2 includes three IPSL mod-
els, IPSLCM5A ( 1SATD2:3C), IPSLCM5A2 ( 1SATD
2:2C) and IPSLCM6A ( 1SATD3:4C), while only IP-
SLCM5A contributed to PlioMIP1. PlioMIP2 includes three
models from NCAR, CCSM4 ( 1SATD2:6C), CESM1.2
(1SATD4:0C) and CESM2 ( 1SATD5:2C), while only
CCSM4 contributed to PlioMIP1. Within both these model
families, the newer versions provide a greater response to the
Pliocene boundary conditions and also have a higher pub-
lished climate sensitivity.
Across the ensemble there is a signiﬁcant correlation be-
tween sensitivity and model resolution (Fig. S8) with a larger
temperature anomaly and precipitation anomaly predicted in
higher-resolution models ( p<0:05). This suggests that low-
resolution models may not be able to capture the full extent
of climate change shown by higher-resolution models. How-
ever, it is noted that these relationships are only statistical
correlations and some models do not show the same pattern.
For example, the CCSM4-Utr model has much greater tem-
perature and precipitation anomalies, and CCSM4 has lower
temperature and precipitation anomalies than other models
of a similar resolution.
5.2 Model representations of Pliocene climate vis-à-vis
proxy data
One of the most fundamental changes in experimental de-
sign between PlioMIP2/PRISM4 and PlioMIP1/PRISM3D
was the approach towards geological data synthesis for data–
model comparison, in particular moving from SST and veg-
etation estimates for a broad time slab to a short SST time
series encompassing the MIS KM5c time slice. This was
necessary in order to assess to what degree climate variabil-
ity within the Pliocene could affect the outcomes of data–
model comparisons and, fundamentally, to derive greater
conﬁdence in the outcomes which could be derived from
https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-2095-2020 Clim. Past, 16, 2095–2123, 20202114 A. M. Haywood et al.: Pliocene climate and climate sensitivity
Pliocene data–model comparisons (Haywood et al., 2013a,
b). In addition, PlioMIP2 contains many new models not
used in PlioMIP1, and the PlioMIP2 boundary conditions
have changed compared to PlioMIP1 (particularly the land–
sea mask and the topography). Nevertheless, what emerges
from the comparison of the PlioMIP2 SST ensemble to the
F&D19_30 SST dataset is a nuanced picture of widespread
data–model agreement with speciﬁc areas of concern.
Data model comparisons undertaken for PlioMIP1 indi-
cated that the PlioMIP1 ensemble overestimated the amount
of SST change as a zonal mean in the tropics (Dowsett et
al., 2012, 2013; Fedorov et al., 2013). In PlioMIP2 point-
based comparisons, there is little indication of a system-
atic mismatch between the data and the models. Models and
proxy data appear to be broadly consistent in the tropics. The
F&D19_30 dataset is comprised of alkenone-based SSTs. In
contrast, the PRISM3D dataset used for DMC in PlioMIP1
was time averaged and composed of estimates from a combi-
nation of faunal analysis, Mg =Ca and alkenone-based SSTs.
Tierney et al. (2019) demonstrated that the PlioMIP1 ensem-
ble compared well to alkenone-based SST estimates in the
tropical Paciﬁc for the whole mid-Pliocene Warm Period,
not just the PlioMIP2 time slice, when the alkenone-based
temperatures were recalculated using the BAYSPLINE cali-
bration. Therefore, the choice of proxy and inter-proxy cali-
bration alone can be enough to alter the interpretation of the
extent to which the model and data agree. In addition, com-
paring the PlioMIP2 results to an additional dataset of pub-
lished SSTs for the time slice (McClymont et al., 2020), we
see that the ﬁrst order outcome of data–model comparison is
the same as that shown by the comparison to F&D19_30.
The Pliocene minus pre-industrial SST anomaly will not
only depend on which SST dataset is chosen to represent
the Pliocene but also on the choice of observed SST dataset
used for the pre-industrial era. Figure S9 shows the proxy-
data-reconstructed SST change using the F&D19_30 dataset
but using two different observed datasets for pre-industrial
SSTs to create the required proxy data SST anomaly. Using
the recently released NOAA ERSST V5 dataset (Huang et
al., 2017) to create the anomaly instead of the older HadISST
data (Rayner et al., 2003) leads to three sites in the North
Atlantic showing a much reduced Pliocene warming. It also
means that several sites in the tropics now show a small (2
to 3C) warming during the Pliocene, while using HadISST
data led to an absence of SST warming at these locations. The
difference between using NOAA ERSST V5 and HadISST is
sufﬁciently large that it can determine whether the PlioMIP2
ensemble is able to largely match (or mismatch) the proxy-
reconstructed temperatures.
Another region of data–model mismatch noted in
PlioMIP1 was the North Atlantic Ocean (NA). Haywood et
al. (2013a) noted a difference in the model-predicted (multi-
model mean) versus proxy-reconstructed (PRISM3D) warm-
ing signal of between 2 to 7C in the NA. The PlioMIP2
multi-model mean SST anomaly appears to be broadly con-sistent with the F&D19_30 dataset with an SST anomaly at
two sites matching to within 1C and the other to within 3C
(Fig. 8). There are several possible ways to account for this
apparent improvement. Firstly, the total number of sites in the
NA in F&D19_30 is reduced compared to the PRISM3D SST
dataset (Dowsett et al., 2010). The site that led to the 7C
difference noted in Haywood et al. (2013a) is not present
in the F&D19_30 dataset. Secondly, the PlioMIP2 experi-
mental design speciﬁed both the Canadian Archipelago and
Bering Strait as closed. Otto-Bliesner et al. (2017) performed
a series of sensitivity tests based on the NCAR CCSM4
PlioMIP1 experiment and found that the closure of these
Arctic gateways strengthened the AMOC by inhibiting trans-
port of less saline waters from the Paciﬁc to the Arctic Ocean
and from the Arctic Ocean to the Labrador Sea, leading to
the warming of NA SSTs. Dowsett et al. (2019) also demon-
strated an improved consistency between the proxy-based
SST changes and model-predicted SST changes after closing
these Arctic gateways in models. It is therefore likely that
the multi-model mean SST change in the NA in PlioMIP2
has been inﬂuenced by the speciﬁed change in Arctic gate-
ways leading to a regionally enhanced ﬁt with proxy data.
However, the question regarding the veracity of the speciﬁed
changes in Arctic gateways in the PRISM4 reconstruction,
given the uncertainty and lack of geological evidence either
way, remains open and requires further study.
One of the clearest data–model inconsistencies occurs in
the Benguela upwelling system, where proxy data indicate
more SST warming than the multi-model mean. The simu-
lation of upwelling systems is particularly challenging for
global numerical climate models due to the spatial scale of
the physical processes involved and the capability of mod-
els to represent changes in the structure of the water column
(thermocline depth), as well as cloud–surface temperature
feedbacks. Dowsett et al. (2013) noted SST discrepancies be-
tween the PRISM3D SST reconstruction and the PlioMIP1
ensemble. Their analysis of the seasonal vertical temperature
proﬁles from PlioMIP1 for the Peru upwelling region indi-
cated that models produced a simple temperature offset be-
tween PI and the Pliocene but did not simulate any change to
thermocline depth.
An assumption that proxy data truly reﬂect mean annual
SSTs in upwelling regions is also worthy of consideration.
In upwelling zones, nutrients (and relatively cold waters)
are brought to the surface increasing productivity. The up-
welling of nutrient rich waters is often seasonally modulated,
which could conceivably bias alkenone-based SSTs to the
seasonal maximum for nutrient supply and therefore coccol-
ithophore productivity and/or alkenone ﬂux. In the modern
ocean, across the most intense region of Benguela upwelling,
the productivity seems to be year-round, whereas southern
Benguela has the highest productivity during the summer
(Rosell-Melé and Prahl, 2013). Ismail et al. (2015), based on
observational data, demonstrated that it was surface heating,
not vertical mixing related to upwelling, which controls the

upper ocean temperature gradient in the region today. This
lends some credence to the idea that the observed mismatch
between PlioMIP2 1SST and the F&D19_30 proxy-based
anomaly could arise from the complexities and/or uncertain-
ties associated with interpreting alkenone-based SSTs in the
region as simply an indication of mean annual SST (Leduc et
al., 2014). However, we note that no seasonal bias has been
identiﬁed in the modern dataset in the Benguela region (Tier-
ney and Tingley, 2018).
5.3 Equilibrium climate sensitivity, Earth system
sensitivity and Pliocene climate
From the analysis shown in Sect. 3.6, a strong relation-
ship between ECS and the ensemble-simulated Pliocene
temperature anomaly is discernible. This point is true for
the globally averaged temperature anomaly, latitudinal av-
erage temperature anomalies in the tropics and speciﬁc grid-
box-based temperature anomalies over large portions of the
globe. Across the ensemble, the tropical Pliocene tempera-
ture anomaly is more strongly related to ECS than other lat-
itudes, both as a latitudinal mean and when considering in-
dividual grid points. On a grid point by grid point basis, the
tropical oceans are strongly related to modelled ECS, sug-
gesting that SST data from the Pliocene tropics have the po-
tential to constrain model estimates of ECS, which highlights
the beneﬁts for deriving estimates of ECS from a concen-
trated effort to reconstruct tropical SST response using the
geological record.
For PlioMIP1, Hargreaves and Annan (2016) also found
that modelled Plio Core–PICrtlSST anomalies over the tropics
(30N–30S) were correlated with modelled ECS, accord-
ing to
ECSD1T 
30N 30S
CCC""; (2)
whereandCare constants and ""represents all errors in
the regression equation. They then used Eq. (2) along with
tropical SST data from PRISM3D (an interpolated dataset of
Pliocene proxy SST) to provide a Pliocene-data-constrained
estimate of ECS of 1.9–3.7C. In order to constrain ECS
from the data and modelling used in PlioMIP2, we slightly
amend the Hargreaves and Annan (2016) methodology be-
cause PlioMIP2 proxy data are more sparsely distributed than
PlioMIP1 proxy data, and we cannot obtain a reliable esti-
mate of tropical average SST from the data available. To es-
timate ECS for PlioMIP2, we instead rely on point-based ob-
servations (Fig. 8a) and local regressions between Plio Core–
PICrtlSST and modelled ECS (Fig. 7c). Hence, we apply
Eq. (2) with1SST from individual data sites, and andC
will now be location dependent. Using this altered method-
ology, a different estimate of ECS is obtained for each data
point; these estimates are shown in Fig. 9 and have a range of
2.6–4.8C with a mean ECS of 3.6C and a standard devia-
tion of 0.6C. Figure 9 does not imply that ECS is different
for each location; instead each value in Fig. 9 is an estimate
Figure 9. Equilibrium climate sensitivity estimated from the data
shown in Fig. 8 based on the modelled grid-point-based regres-
sions between Plio Core–PICtrland ECS. This analysis was limited to
those data points which were within 1C of the range of PlioMIP2
models, and it was also limited to those sites which were in a grid
box where the modelling suggested a signiﬁcant relationship be-
tween the Plio Core–PICtrlSAT anomaly and the ECS.
of ECS and incorporates the true Pliocene-constrained ECS
along with several errors. For a data point to be included in
Fig. 9, we required that two conditions were met. Firstly, we
required that the relationship between local Plio Core–PICrtl
and a model’s ECS was signiﬁcant at the 95 % conﬁdence
level (p<0:05; these regions are hatched in Fig. 7d). Sec-
ondly, we required that at least one of the models in the
PlioMIP2 ensemble was within 1C of the data; this sec-
ond condition meant that we excluded two sites off the east-
ern United States, two sites from the Mediterranean and two
sites from Benguela – despite these sites showing a theoreti-
cal relationship between Plio Core–PICrtland ECS. Altogether
13 data points fulﬁlled both these conditions and could be
used to estimate ECS. The range of estimates of ECS from
PlioMIP2 (2.6–4.8C) are similar to IPCC (1.5–4.5C) but
are slightly higher than was estimated from PlioMIP1 (1.9–
3.7C). It is not currently possible to add reliable error bars
to the range of ECS estimates from PlioMIP2. However, as
the Tier1 PlioMIP2 experiments with CO 2set to 350 and
450 ppmv become available, we will be able to provide an
indication as to how uncertainties in the KM5c CO 2would
affect the PlioMIP2/PRISM4-constrained estimates of ECS.
In addition, as more orbitally tuned SST data become avail-
able, it will be necessary to revisit the ECS analysis in order
to ensure maximum accuracy.
The emergence of the concept of longer-term sensitivity,
ESS, can be at least partly attributed to the study of the
Pliocene epoch (Lunt et al., 2010; Haywood et al., 2013a).
However, as Hunter et al. (2019) state clearly, the comparison
between ECS, Plio Core–PICrtl, and ESS can only be robust
if an assumption is made that the PlioMIP2 model bound-
ary conditions are a good approximation to the equilibrated
https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-2095-2020 Clim. Past, 16, 2095–2123, 20202116 A. M. Haywood et al.: Pliocene climate and climate sensitivity
Earth system with enhanced atmospheric CO 2concentration.
This may appear to be a reasonable assumption now since
the changes in non-glacial elements of the PRISM4 palaeo-
geography are limited. Yet, within the bounds of plausible
uncertainty, a larger number of additional palaeogeographic
modiﬁcations remain possible for the late Pliocene than were
incorporated into the PRISM4 reconstruction (see Hill, 2015
and De Schepper et al., 2015) and which may have a bearing
on how well the Pliocene is seen to approximate an equili-
brated modern Earth system in the years ahead.
PlioMIP1 determined a range in the ESS =CS ratio of be-
tween 1.1 and 2.0 with a best estimate of 1.5. In PlioMIP2,
which has beneﬁted from the access to a larger array of mod-
els and new boundary conditions, the range and best esti-
mate of the ESS =CS ratio is similar but slightly larger (1.1 to
2.9 and 1.7 respectively). Therefore, new modelling and new
constraints on the data for PlioMIP2 suggest a slight increase
in estimates of both the ESS =CS ratio and data-constrained
estimates of ECS between PlioMIP1 and PlioMIP2.
6 Conclusions
The Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 repre-
sents one of the largest ensembles of climate models of dif-
ferent complexities and spatial resolution ever assembled to
study a speciﬁc interval in Earth history. PlioMIP2 builds on
the ﬁndings of PlioMIP1 and incorporates state-of-the-art re-
constructions of Pliocene boundary conditions and new tem-
porally consistent sea surface temperature proxy data which
underpin the new data–model comparison. The major ﬁnd-
ings of the work include the following.
- Global annual mean surface air temperatures increase
by 1.7 to 5.2C compared to the pre-industrial era with
a multi-model average increase of 3.2C.
- The mean annual surface air temperature response is
larger in PlioMIP2 than in PlioMIP1 mainly due to the
addition of new and more sensitive models in PlioMIP2.
- The multi-model mean annual total precipitation rate in-
creases by 7 % compared to the pre-industrial era, while
the modelled range of precipitation increases by be-
tween 2 % and 13 %.
- The multi-model mean anomaly between the Pliocene
and pre-industrial era is statistically robust for sur-
face air temperature and sea surface temperature over
most of the globe. The multi-model mean precipita-
tion anomaly is robust at middle–high latitudes and in
monsoon regions but is smaller than the inter-model
standard deviation in many parts of the tropics and sub-
tropics.
- The degree of polar ampliﬁcation of surface air temper-
ature change is generally consistent with RCP transientclimate modelling experiments used to predict future
climate, implying that CO 2changes dominate the ice
sheet changes in the Plio Coreexperiments.
- The land warms more than the oceans in a manner akin
to future climate change simulations.
- As an ensemble, average NH warming does not show a
clear seasonal cycle, but a clear seasonal cycle is seen
in many individual models.
- The difference in the average warming between the
hemispheres is subdued relative to simulations of
2100 CE climate. This is likely due to the substan-
tial changes to the albedo feedback mechanism in the
Southern Hemisphere following the removal of large ar-
eas of the Antarctic ice sheet in the mid-Pliocene.
- There is a statistically signiﬁcant relationship between
ECS and Pliocene global annual average temperature
change. The PlioMIP2 ensemble ﬁnds that ESS is
greater than ECS by a best estimate of 67 %.
- Model estimates of the relationship between ECS and
Plio Core–PICrtl, combined with the PlioMIP2 1SST,
provide a data-constrained estimate of ECS with a range
of 2.6–4.8C. This is larger than the values suggested
from PlioMIP1 (1.9–3.7C).
- The PlioMIP2 model ensemble shows broad agreement
on the polar ampliﬁcation of the global warming signal
and tropical enhancement of rainfall anomalies. Inter-
model differences in simulated temperature are mostly
found in polar regions and where the land–sea mask and
orography of Pliocene palaeogeography differ from to-
day.
- The PlioMIP2 ensemble appears to be broadly recon-
cilable with new temporally speciﬁc records of sea sur-
face temperatures. Signiﬁcant agreement between simu-
lated and reconstructed temperature change is seen with
notable local signals of data–model disagreement. Dif-
ferences between observed pre-industrial sea surface
temperature datasets are large enough to have a sig-
niﬁcant impact on how well models reproduce proxy-
reconstructed ocean temperature changes.

Abstract Irrigation is the single largest anthropogenic
water use, a modiﬁcation of the land surface that signiﬁ-
cantly affects surface energy budgets, the water cycle, andclimate. Irrigation, however, is typically not included in
standard historical general circulation model (GCM) sim-
ulations along with other anthropogenic and natural forc-ings. To investigate the importance of irrigation as an
anthropogenic climate forcing, we conduct two 5-member
ensemble GCM experiments. Both are setup identical to thehistorical forced (anthropogenic plus natural) scenario used
in version 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project,
but in one experiment we also add water to the land surfaceusing a dataset of historically estimated irrigation rates.
Irrigation has a negligible effect on the global average
radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere, but causessigniﬁcant cooling of global average surface air tempera-
tures over land and dampens regional warming trends. This
cooling is regionally focused and is especially strong in
Western North America, the Mediterranean, the Middle
East, and Asia. Irrigation enhances cloud cover and pre-
cipitation in these same regions, except for summer in parts
of Monsoon Asia, where irrigation causes a reduction in
monsoon season precipitation. Irrigation cools the surface,reducing upward ﬂuxes of longwave radiation (increasing
net longwave), and increases cloud cover, enhancing
shortwave reﬂection (reducing net shortwave). The relative
magnitude of these two processes causes regional increases(northern India) or decreases (Central Asia, China) in
energy availability at the surface and top of the atmo-
sphere. Despite these changes in net radiation, however,climate responses are due primarily to larger magnitude
shifts in the Bowen ratio from sensible to latent heating.
Irrigation impacts on temperature, precipitation, and otherclimate variables are regionally signiﬁcant, even while
other anthropogenic forcings (anthropogenic aerosols,
greenhouse gases, etc.) dominate the long term climateevolution in the simulations. To better constrain the mag-
nitude and uncertainties of irrigation-forced climate
anomalies, irrigation should therefore be considered asanother important anthropogenic climate forcing in the
next generation of historical climate simulations and multi-
model assessments.

1 Introduction
General circulation model (GCM) simulations of the his-
torical period (1850–present) use observation based esti-mates of natural (e.g., solar variability, volcanic eruptions)
and anthropogenic [e.g., anthropogenic aerosols, green-
house gas (GHG) concentrations, land use, etc.] forcings tosimulate the last 150 years of climate evolution. Historical
simulations provide an important baseline for understand-
ing the context of future climate change, are used to test
climate system responses to speciﬁc forcings, and are
required for detection and attribution studies. These
experiments therefore form an integral part of the modelintercomparisons organized in tandem with the Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment

DOI 10.1007/s00382-014-2204-7reports (e.g., Taylor et al. 2012 ). Recent historical model-
ing studies have addressed diverse topics, including the
impact of anthropogenic aerosol emissions on North
Atlantic climate variability (Booth et al. 2012 ), the role of
the ocean in the recent surface warming hiatus (Kosaka and
Xie2013 ), and the detection and attribution of anthropo-
genically forced warming trends (Santer et al. 2013 ). One
anthropogenic forcing that is typically not included in
standard historical GCM simulations, including the IPCC
model intercomparisons, is irrigation.
Irrigation is the single largest anthropogenic water use,
accounting for 70 % of global freshwater withdrawals and90 % of consumption (Siebert et al. 2010 ). Irrigation has
expanded and intensiﬁed rapidly over the twentieth cen-
tury, accelerating after 1950 with the increased exploitationof groundwater resources (Rodell et al. 2009 ; Scanlon et al.
2012 ; Wada et al. 2010 ), and the climate effects of irri-
gation have been broadly documented (e.g., in the reviewby Mahmood et al. 2013b ). In areas where evapotranspi-
ration rates are moisture limited, the addition of irrigation
water shifts the surface energy balance to favor latent oversensible heating, decreasing the Bowen ratio and reducing
soil and air temperatures (Kueppers et al. 2007 ; Sacks et al.
2009 ). This ﬁrst order effect has been documented pri-
marily in areas characterized by growing seasons with low
moisture availability and high atmospheric demand, such
as the Central Valley of California (Bonﬁls and Lobell
2007 ) and the southern Great Plains (Barnston and
Schickedanz 1984 ). Enhanced evapotranspiration from
irrigation can also increase atmospheric water vapor, withpotential consequences for the regional and global radiative
balance. For example, Boucher et al. ( 2004 ) found that
irrigation, when added to a GCM, acted as a net positiveradiative forcing due to the enhanced trapping of longwave
radiation from increased humidity, an effect that may be
enough to increase local minimum temperatures (Mah-mood et al. 2013a ). Alternatively, if increased evapo-
transpiration from irrigation also enhances cloud
formation, this may reduce the net solar forcing at the
surface or top of the atmosphere (TOA) by increasing
albedo and shortwave reﬂection. Finally, although large
uncertainties remain, there is evidence that irrigation mayeven enhance precipitation locally and downwind of major
irrigation regions (e.g., Barnston and Schickedanz 1984 ;
DeAngelis et al. 2010 ; Lo and Famiglietti 2013 ).
There is clear evidence that irrigation has important
local, regional, and possibly global effects on climate.
Despite this, irrigation is typically not included as ananthropogenic forcing in historical GCM simulations along
with land cover change, aerosols, GHGs, and other forc-
ings. Here, we conduct a new suite of historical GCM
experiments with the Goddard Institute for Space Studies
(GISS) atmosphere GCM, ModelE2 (Schmidt et al. 2014 ),coupled to the Russell ocean model (Russell et al. 1995 )
and using historically estimated irrigation rates from the
dataset of Wisser et al. ( 2010 ). Ours is the ﬁrst GCM study
of irrigation to quantify the importance of irrigation as aclimate forcing in the context of other natural and
anthropogenic forcings during the climate evolution of the
twentieth century, using the same framework as the forced
historical simulations from the Coupled Model Intercom-
parison Project version 5 (CMIP5, Taylor et al. 2012 ).
2 Data and methods
2.1 GISS ModelE2
All experiments are conducted with the coupled GCM
ModelE2-R (2
/C14/C22:5/C14latitude/longitude resolution),
which includes the latest version of the state-of-the-artGISS atmosphere general circulation model (ModelE2),
with updated physics for inclusion in the CMIP5 (Schmidt
et al. 2014 ), and the Russell (R) ocean model (Hansen et al.
2007 ; Russell et al. 1995 ). Historical simulations using
current (Miller et al. 2014 ) and previous (Hansen et al.
2007 ) versions of the model demonstrate the ability of
ModelE2 to realistically reproduce historical responses to
external climate forcings, including volcanic eruptions and
anthropogenic GHGs. For our experiments, we use theversion of model physics with non-interactive atmospheric
composition (referred to as NINT in Miller et al. 2014 ),
where concentrations of ozone and radiatively importantaerosols are prescribed according to observation based
decadal averages.
The irrigation module in ModelE2-R uses historically
varying, monthly irrigation rates from a 0 :5
/C14resolution
reconstruction of twentieth century global hydrography
(Wisser et al. 2010 ). Wisser et al. ( 2010 ) derive historical
irrigation rates from 1901 to 2002 using the University of
Frankfurt/FAO Global Maps of Irrigated Areas (Siebert
et al. 2005a ,b) (extended back to 1901 by Freydank and
Siebert 2008 ) and an ofﬂine model of terrestrial water
balance and transport (WBMplus; Federer et al. 2003 ;
Vo¨ro¨smarty et al. 1998 ). WBMplus includes explicit rep-
resentations of human activities that affect the water cycle:
irrigation (Wisser et al. 2008 ) and reservoir operation
(Wisser et al. 2010 ). For areas equipped for irrigation in
WBMplus, an irrigation water ﬂux is applied to the soil to
compensate for climate observation forced soil moisture
deﬁcits, including an explicit treatment for paddy rice
irrigation. In ModelE2-R, this new irrigation ﬂux of water,
calculated ofﬂine in WBMplus, is added to the top of the
vegetated fraction of the soil column, below the vegetationcanopy. Without a separate soil column for the irrigated
crop fraction, irrigation is applied to the total vegetatedB. I. Cook et al.
123fraction. The implications of this simpliﬁcation are
addressed in the discussion section of this paper. Previous
studies with the GISS model have used the irrigation
module to investigate irrigation impacts on climate during
the historical period (Puma and Cook 2010 ; Shukla et al.
2013 ) and under increased GHG forcing (Cook et al. 2011 ).
Because our model simulations for this study begin in
1850, we linearly extrapolated the model irrigation from
1901 back to 1850. Further details on the development of
the underlying irrigation dataset, and its implementation in
ModelE2-R, can be found in Wisser et al. ( 2010 ) and Puma
and Cook ( 2010 ), respectively.
Irrigation is concentrated in the major regions of agri-
cultural production in the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. 1). In
the early part of the century (1901–1920, Fig. 1a), most
irrigation occurs in Monsoon Asia, with secondary centers
in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and North America.By the end of the twentieth century (1981–2000, Fig. 1b),
irrigation rates intensify in these areas, and expand into
additional regions, such as Northern Europe and Central
Asia. Differences between the early and late twentieth
century irrigation maps reﬂect the steady increase in global
irrigation rates over the last 100 years (Fig. 2a), with a
notable acceleration after about 1950 that coincides with
the start of the green revolution and exploitation ofgroundwater resources. The vast majority of global irri-
gation is concentrated in Monsoon Asia (Fig. 2b), where
water intensive rice cultivation dominates the agricultural
landscape. In North America there is a notable jump at
1950, coinciding with the start of exploitation of theOgallala aquifer (Scanlon et al. 2012 ). Over the European
domain (Fig. 2d), irrigation increases over the course of the
twentieth century before plateauing in the 1980s.
2.2 Experiments
We conduct two 5-member ensemble experiments with
ModelE2-R from 1850–2000, with initial conditions taken
from a near-equilibrium pre-industrial control run withatmospheric composition and solar irradiance held ﬁxed at
1850 values. In experiment HIST, all forcings are identical
to those used in the standard ModelE2-R historical simu-lations submitted for the CMIP5 effort (Miller et al. 2014 ),
including solar and volcanic forcing, anthropogenic GHGs,
land cover, and tropospheric aerosols (natural and anthro-pogenic). In experiment HIST ?IRR we include, as an
additional forcing, transient historical irrigation rates, as
described previously. Differences between the two exper-
iments (HIST þIRR/C0HIST) are used to assess the cli-
matic impact of irrigation. Because we are interested in the

3 Results
3.1 Global average response
In both experiments, the historical evolution of net
radiation (Rnet) at the TOA follows the expected
increase from enhanced GHG forcing and trapping ofoutgoing longwave radiation (Fig. 3a). Large magnitude,
but short-lived, negative spikes in Rnet correspond to
volcanic eruptions and the associated negative aerosol
forcing. At the TOA, Rnet is about ?0:02 W m
/C02higher
in HIST ?IRR compared to HIST, similar to the mag-
nitude of irrigation forcing ( ?0:03 W m/C02) found in the
experiments of Boucher et al. ( 2004 ). Irrigation forcing
at the TOA in our experiments is insigniﬁcant
ðp[0:05Þ, however, suggesting that irrigation has a
negligible effect on the global TOA radiative balance. It
should be noted, though, that the standard radiative
forcing concept might be difﬁcult to apply to irrigationbecause of the temperature, energy balance, and water
vapor feedbacks inherent in the irrigation–climate
response (Boucher et al. 2004 ).
Irrigation has a cooling effect on global average

ferences between the two simulations are small and insig-niﬁcant ðp[0:05;DT

tion run, but this increase is only marginally signiﬁcant

Increasing irrigation rates over the twentieth century cause
signiﬁcant differences in regional temperature trends. BothHIST (Fig. 4a) and HIST ?IRR (Fig. 4b) show wide-
spread and signiﬁcant warming in annual average surface
air temperatures from 1971 to 2000 (insigniﬁcant differ-ences at p[0:05 in Fig. 4have been masked out). In
many areas with major irrigation expansion or intensiﬁca-
tion, however, these warming trends weaken (WesternNorth America), become insigniﬁcant (Europe), or, in
some cases, reverse to cooling trends (extra-tropical South
America, India).
The time when irrigation begins to signiﬁcantly affect
surface air temperature varies by region. In Central Asia
and China (Fig.
5a, b), temperatures in the two simulations1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000−1.5−1−0.500.511.5 W m−2Global Average Anomalies, Land+Ocean

warming up to the 1950s, followed by multi-decadal
cooling often ascribed to increased aerosol forcing (e.g., He
et al. 2013 ; Qian and Giorgi 2000 ). Despite the temperature
offset, both regions have similar temperature trends over
1971–2000. This contrasts sharply with India (Fig. 5c),
where irrigation rates are high enough across the wholecentury to lead to continuously cooler surface temperatures
in HIST ?IRR. Temperatures trends do diverge over
India, with increasing irrigation causing a slight cooling
trend over the last 30 years of the century. Late twentieth
century temperature trends are similar between the HIST
and HIST ?IRR simulations for the Mediterranean
(Fig. 5d), the Middle East (Fig. 5e), and Western North
America (Fig. 5f). Cooler average temperatures in HIS-
T?IRR manifest in the Mediterranean and Western North

3.3 Spatial response: 1981–2000
Irrigation effects on climate in the late twentieth century
(1981–2000) are highly localized, coinciding with landareas where irrigation is most intense. Irrigation causes
widespread cooling (Fig. 6a), primarily over Western
North America, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, India,
Indochina, Central Asia, and China. Localized cooling is
generally on the order of /C00:5t o/C01:0 K, with much more
intensive cooling over northern India, where the highest
irrigation rates in the model and irrigation dataset occur.Irrigation increases atmospheric moisture, primarily at low
levels, and this is reﬂected in the 850 hPa speciﬁc humidity
(Fig. 6b) and low level (surface to 680 hPa) cloud cover
(Fig. 6c). In concert with these humidity increases, pre-
cipitation is also enhanced (Fig. 6d), especially in Western
North America, the Middle East, and Central Asia. The
only major region where annual land precipitation signiﬁ-
cantly declines is in far eastern India, Bangladesh, andMyanmar in Monsoon Asia due to drying during the
summer monsoon.
Despite little impact on the globally averaged radiative
balance, irrigation has a large effect on regional radiative
ﬂuxes (Fig. 7). Signiﬁcant changes in net total radiation at
the surface (Fig. 7a) and TOA (Fig. 7b) occur primarily
over Monsoon and Central Asia. Over the Indian subcon-
tinent and Southeast Asia, net radiation increases, while

123over Central Asia and China net radiation decreases. Irri-
gation reduces net shortwave at TOA (Fig. 7c) and the
surface (Fig. 7d), especially over Western North America,
the Middle East, and Asia. These reductions coincide clo-sely with the increases in cloud cover (Fig. 6c), indicating
this change is through increased reﬂection by clouds.
Indeed, areas where net shortwave is actually increasing(e.g., northern India) are areas where cloud cover declines.
Irrigation increases net longwave ﬂuxes (Fig. 7e, f). In
ModelE2-R this occurs because the cooler soil tempera-
tures reduce outgoing longwave ﬂuxes; increased longwave
trapping from enhanced near surface humidity is small (notshown). Over North America, the longwave and shortwave
effects largely cancel, leading to negligible changes in net
radiation. In India, the enhanced longwave dominates,increasing net total radiation, while in Central Asia and
China, the shortwave reductions drive an overall decline in
energy availability.Irrigation has a much larger impact on surface energy
partitioning (sensible, Fig. 8a, and latent, Fig. 8b) than on
total energy availability in our experiments. In areas where
irrigation rates are high (Western North America, theMediterranean, Middle East, India), the addition of irriga-
tion water shifts the Bowen ratio to favor latent over sen-
sible heating, and these shifts coincide closely with muchof the surface cooling in Fig. 6a. Outside the main irriga-
tion regions, signiﬁcant increases in latent heating and
reductions in sensible heating are related to local increases
in precipitation (e.g., the Sahara; Fig. 6d). The dominance
of Bowen ratio versus energy balance shifts for the tem-perature response in our experiments contrasts sharply with
the irrigation study of Sacks et al. ( 2009 ). In their study,
Sacks et al found instead that the cooling response was
driven primarily by irrigation-induced increases in cloud
cover and reductions in surface shortwave radiation, rather
than by direct evaporative cooling.1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000−0.4−0.200.20.40.60.81

1233.4 Regional and seasonal effects
Highest irrigation rates occur in Asia, and this is where the
largest temperature and precipitation responses occur
(Fig. 9). In the relatively temperate mid-latitude regions of
China (Fig. 9, top row) and Central Asia (Fig. 9, middle
row), irrigation is highest during boreal summer, and it is
during the warm months that most of the signiﬁcant cool-
ing occurs (indicated by red stars, p/C200:05, two-sided
Student’s ttest). Irrigation signiﬁcantly enhances warm
season precipitation in June in China and during May,
June, August, and September in Central Asia. Irrigationrates are much higher over the region of India ?Bangla-
desh, with larger (and signiﬁcant) magnitude temperature
and precipitation anomalies in most months (Fig. 9, bottom
row). This is partly due to the more sub-tropical nature of
this region, characterized by relatively high evaporative
demand throughout the year and a pronounced dry season
during boreal winter. Most cooling in India ?Bangladesh
occurs during this dry season, but precipitation responses
are seasonally dependent. Precipitation increases are small,but signiﬁcant, during the dry season, and are likely linked
to increased evapotranspiration from irrigation during the
relatively warm dry season. During the main summermonsoon season, precipitation deﬁcits are large and con-
centrated in eastern India and Bangladesh. These changes
may be related to the tendency for irrigation to weaken the
summer monsoon circulation in this region (discussed in
detail in Shukla et al. 2013 ). An analysis of the surface
energy balance partitioning in these regions (Fig. 10)
indicates that the temperature changes are due primarily tochanges in the Bowen ratio, rather than total energy
availability. In China and India ?Bangladesh, signiﬁcant
changes in net radiation at the surface (Fig. 10, left col-
umn) are all positive, indicating the dominance of the
longwave effects, while in Central Asia increased short-
wave reﬂection causes a net reduction in surface energy.These changes in net energy availability, however, are
much smaller than the changes in latent (Fig. 10, center
column) and sensible (Fig. 10, right column) heat ﬂuxes.
Irrigation also has a large and signiﬁcant impact on
climate in the Mediterranean (Fig. 11, top row), Middle
East (Fig. 11, middle row), and Western North America
(Fig. 11, bottom row). These three regions are generally
characterized by warm summers with high evaporative
demand and, as with China and Central Asia, the warmseason is when the temperature (cooling) and precipitation
(enhanced) responses are largest. Notably, precipitationΔ2-m Air Temp (K)

123increases in Western North America occur during July-
August-September, the same season of enhancement found
in the irrigation experiments of Lo and Famiglietti ( 2013 ).
Irrigation causes some net increases in net radiation
(Fig. 12, left column) in the Mediterranean and Middle
East, but the shortwave and longwave effects cancel outover Western North America. As with Asia, shifts in latent
(Fig. 12, center column) and sensible (Fig. 12, right col-
umn) heat ﬂuxes are much larger than any changes in net
energy availability.
4 Discussion and conclusions
Human land use and land cover change is an important
anthropogenic climate forcing (Mahmood et al. 2013b ),
with regional impacts that may match or even exceed
localized responses to globally well-mixed anthropogenicGHG forcing (Pielke et al. 2011 ). But while the effects of
land cover change on historical and future climate have
been comprehensively assessed (e.g., Feddema et al. 2005 ;
Kumar et al. 2013 ; Pitman et al. 2009 ), only recently have
studies begun to analyze the response of the climate system
to second order land use effects (Luyssaert et al. 2014 ).
This includes cropland management (Lobell et al. 2006 ),
crop growth and development (Chen and Xie 2012 ), and
irrigation (Lobell et al. 2006 ; Sacks et al. 2009 ). In this
study, we use a new set of historically forced GCM
experiments to investigate the importance of irrigation as
an historical climate forcing.
Compared to other regionally important anthropogenic
forcings, such as land cover change (Boisier et al. 2012 )
or aerosols (e.g., Bellouin et al. 2013 ; Booth et al. 2012 ),
irrigation has relatively small effects on the total energy
availability at the surface or TOA for most areas. Sig-
niﬁcant perturbations to net total radiation are largelya b

(e.g., Central Asia and China at TOA) to þ10 (e.g., India
at the surface) W m/C02, depending on whether shortwave
or longwave effects dominate. Instead, irrigation has amuch larger and widespread inﬂuence on the surface
partitioning between sensible and latent heat ﬂuxes
(Fig. 8). It is these shifts in the Bowen ratio that cause
widespread regional cooling and enhancement of pre-
cipitation, with climate responses generally scaling with
the intensity of irrigation. The small impact of irrigationon net energy availability is perhaps not surprising, given
that the addition of irrigation does not directly add
substantial amounts of energy to the global earth system.Any changes in net radiation must then come from
secondary effects (e.g., cloud cover changes, increasedatmospheric water vapor, etc.) which, as noted, were
small at the global scale.
Contrary to observations (e.g., Jones et al. 2012 ),
warming trends in HIST ?IRR from 1971 to 2000 become
insigniﬁcant or actually reverse in Northern Europe and
India, suggesting that climate in ModelE2-R is overly
sensitive to irrigation, at least in certain regions. Thisoverestimation of irrigation effects on climate, and the
subsequent divergence between our GCM simulations and
observed warming trends, could occur for a variety ofreasons. First, the magnitude of climate responses to irri-
gation depends crucially on the evaporative regime, i.e. the
degree to which evapotranspiration rates are energy(demand) versus moisture (supply) limited (Cook et al.
2011 ; Puma and Cook 2010 ). The extent to which models

123can accurately simulate observed evaporative regimes,
however, is affected by numerous model dependent factors,
including precipitation biases and land surface parameter-izations (e.g., rooting depth, vegetation seasonality, etc.).
Ultimately, if model soils are too dry compared to the real
world, irrigation will have a larger effect on evapotrans-piration and the subsequent climate response will be
ampliﬁed. Relatedly, land–atmosphere coupling strengths
are known to vary widely across GCMs (Koster et al.2006 ). Second, models with lower resolution than theoriginal irrigation dataset ð0:5
/C14Þmay amplify irrigation–
climate responses (Puma and Cook 2010 ; Sacks et al.
2009 ). For this study, the underlying irrigation dataset was
aggregated to the coarser resolution ð2/C14/C22:5/C14Þof Mo-
delE2-R by summing all irrigation grid cells that would fall
within each coarser ModelE2-R grid cell. A single cell at
coarser resolution may then include both irrigated and non-
irrigated areas from the original irrigation dataset, even as
the whole cell is treated as irrigated in the model. This can
result in greater irrigated areas and potentially higher ChinaΔ2−m Air Temp (K) ΔPrecipitation (mm day  ) Irrigation (mm day  )

123evapotranspiration rates and climate responses. To improve
the realism of these responses, increases in spatial resolu-
tion of the model’s land and vegetation modules would
reduce overestimates of irrigated area. More directly,ModelE2-R should be modiﬁed to simulate the dynamics
of a separate soil column for irrigated crops within each
grid cell. These changes would lead (ideally) to improved
soil moisture and evapotranspiration dynamics for both
irrigated crops and other vegetation. Finally, there are stilllarge uncertainties in how irrigation interacts with other
anthropogenic forcings in GCMs. For example, anthopo-
genic aerosol forcing has important effects on the surfaceenergy balance in many regions, which may affect theevaporative regime and evapotranspiration rates (Naza-
renko and Menon 2005 ).
Where possible, we attempted to compare our results
with other irrigation studies, but a comprehensive com-parison was difﬁcult for multiple reasons. For example,
there is little standardization across modeling studies in
the experimental setup, amount of irrigation forcing
applied, and the model diagnostics reported. Analyses of
irrigation effects on climate would therefore clearlybeneﬁt from standardized multi-model intercomparisons,
similar to existing projects studying other land surface-
climate interactions, such as GLACE (Koster et al. 2006 ;
Seneviratne et al. 2013 ) and LUCID (Boisier et al. 2012 ;JFMAMJJASOND−12−10−8−6−4−20

sons are becoming increasingly tractable as GCM groups
have begun integrating their own irrigation schemes,
including the Community Earth System Model (CESM,Levis and Sacks 2011 ) and Laboratoire de Me ´te´orologie
Dynamique (LMD-Z, Guimberteau et al. 2012 ). Ideally,
such an intercomparison would, at minimum, (1) stan-dardize the set of model diagnostics reported and ana-
lyzed (e.g., energy balance terms, temperature, etc.) and
(2) use a common dataset of irrigation forcing, such asthe WBMplus data set used here. Such a set of experi-
ments would be especially helpful for highlighting modelbased uncertainties in the irrigation–climate response
(e.g., model resolution, surface climate biases, etc.).
Additionally, given the broad evidence presented here,
and in other modeling and empirical studies, for a sig-niﬁcant impact of irrigation on climate, we believe that
irrigation should be included as another standard histor-
ical anthropogenic climate forcing in future multi-modelassessments, such as the CMIP6 (Meehl et al. 2014 ). The
importance of irrigation for historical (and future) cli-
mate can then be assessed in comparison to otherimportant anthropogenic forcings, such as aerosols, land
cover change, and GHGs.JFMAMJJASOND−0.2−0.100.10.20.3

4.1  INTRODUCTION
The impacts of present and potential future climate change will be 
one of the most important scientific and societal challenges in the 
21st century. Given observed changes in temperature, sea ice, and sea level, improving our understanding of the climate system is an interna-tional priority. This system is characterized by complex phenomena that are imperfectly observed and even more imperfectly simulated. But with an ever- growing supply of climate data from satellites and environmental 4.5 Climate Data Analysis: Problems and Approaches 91

sensors, the magnitude of data and climate model output is beginning 
to overwhelm the relatively simple tools currently used to analyze them. A computational approach will therefore be indispensable for these analysis challenges. This chapter introduces the fledgling research disci-pline climate informatics : collaborations between climate scientists and 
machine learning researchers in order to bridge this gap between data and understanding. We hope that the study of climate informatics will acceler-ate discovery in answering pressing questions in climate science.
Machine learning is an active research area at the interface of com-
puter science and statistics, concerned with developing automated tech-niques, or algorithms, to detect patterns in data. Machine learning (and data mining) algorithms are critical to a range of technologies, including Web search, recommendation systems, personalized Internet advertis-ing, computer vision, and natural language processing. Machine learning has also made significant impacts on the natural sciences, for example, in biology; the interdisciplinary field of bioinformatics has facilitated many discoveries in genomics and proteomics. The impact of machine learning on climate science promises to be similarly profound.
The goal of this chapter is to define climate informatics  and to propose 
some grand challenges for this nascent field. Recent progress on climate informatics, by the authors as well as by other groups, reveals that col-laborations with climate scientists also open up interesting new problems for machine learning. There are a myriad of collaborations possible at the intersection of these two fields. This chapter uses both top- down and  bottom- up approaches to stimulate research progress on a range of prob-lems in climate informatics, some of which have yet to be proposed. For the former, we present challenge problems posed by climate scientists, and discussed with machine learning, data mining, and statistics researchers at Climate Informatics 2011 , the First International Workshop on Climate 
Informatics , the inaugural event of a new annual workshop in which all 
co-authors participated. To spur innovation from the bottom- up, we also describe and discuss some of the types of data available. In addition to summarizing some of the key challenges for climate informatics, this chapter also draws on some of the recent climate informatics research of the co- authors.
The chapter is organized as follows. First, we discuss the types of cli-
mate data available and outline some challenges for climate informatics, including problems in analyzing climate data. Then we go into further detail on several key climate informatics problems: seasonal climate 84   ◾   Computational Intelligent Data Analysis for Sustainable Development
forecasting, predicting climate extremes, reconstructing past climate, and 
some problems in polar regions. We then discuss some machine learning and statistical approaches that might prove promising (and that were not mentioned in previous sections). Finally, we discuss some challenges and opportunities for climate science data and data management. Due to the broad coverage of the chapter, related work discussions are interspersed throughout the sections.
4.2  MACHINE LEARNING
Over the past few decades, the field of machine learning has matured sig-
nificantly, drawing on ideas from several disciplines, including optimiza-tion, statistics, and artificial intelligence [4, 34]. Application of machine learning has led to important advances in a wide variety of domains rang-ing from Internet applications to scientific problems. Machine learning methods have been developed for a wide variety of predictive modeling as well as exploratory data analysis problems. In the context of predictive modeling, important advances have been made in linear classification and regression, hierarchical linear models, nonlinear models based on kernels, as well as ensemble methods that combine outputs from different predic-tors. In the context of exploratory data analysis, advances have been made in clustering and dimensionality reduction, including nonlinear methods to detect low- dimensional manifold structures in the data. Some of the important themes driving research in modern machine learning are moti-vated by properties of modern datasets from scientific, societal, and com-mercial applications. In particular, the datasets are extremely large scale, running into millions or billions of data points; are high- dimensional, going up to tens of thousands or more dimensions; and have intricate statistical dependencies that violate the “independent and identically dis-tributed” assumption made in traditional approaches. Such properties are readily observed in climate datasets, including observations, reanaly-sis, as well as climate model outputs. These aspects have led to increased emphasis on scalable optimization methods [94], online learning methods [11], and graphical models [47], which can handle large- scale data in high dimensions with statistical dependencies.
4.3  UNDERSTANDING AND USING CLIMATE DATA
Profuse amounts of climate data of various types are available, providing 
a rich and fertile playground for future data mining and machine learn-ing research. Here we discuss some of the varieties of data available, and Climate Informatics    ◾   85  
provide some suggestions on how they can be used. The discussion opens 
up some interesting problems. There are multiple sources of climate data, ranging from single- site observations scattered in an unstructured way across the globe to climate model output that is global and uniformly gridded. Each class of data has particular characteristics that should be appreciated before it can be successfully used or compared. We provide here a brief introduction to each, with a few examples and references for further information. Common issues that arise in cross- class syntheses are also addressed.
4.3.1  In- Situ Observations
In- situ  measurements refer to raw (or only minimally processed) measure-
ments of diverse climate system properties that can include temperatures, rainfall, winds, column ozone, cloud cover, radiation, etc., taken from spe-cific locations. These locations are often at the surface (e.g., from weather stations), but can also include atmospheric measurements from radio-sonde balloons, sub surface ocean data from floats, data from ships, air-craft, and special intensive observing platforms.
Much of this data is routinely collected and made available in col-
lated form from National Weather Services or special projects such as AEROCOM (for aerosol data), International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) (ocean temperature and salinity from ships), Argo (ocean floats), etc. Multivariate data related to single experi-ments (e.g., the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program or the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA)), are a little less well orga-nized, although usually available at specialized websites.
This kin d o f da ta is useful f o r l oo king a t coh er en t m ul tivaria te co m -
parisons, although usually on limited time and space domains, as input to weather model analyses or as the raw material for processed gridded data (see next subsection). The principal problem with this data is their sparse-ness spatially and, in time, inhomogeneities due to differing measurement practices or instruments and overall incompleteness (not all variables are measured at the same time or place) [45, 62].
4.3.2  Gridded/ Processed Observations
Given a network of raw in- situ  data, the next step is synthesizing those 
networks into quality- controlled regularly gridded datasets. These have a number of advantages over the raw data in that they are easier to work with, are more comparable to model output (discussed below), and have 86   ◾   Computational Intelligent Data Analysis for Sustainable Development
fewer nonclimatic artifacts. Gridded products are usually available on 
5° latitude by 5° longitude grids or even higher resolution. However, these products use interpolation, gap- filling in space and time, and correc-tions for known biases, all of which affect the structural uncertainty in the product. The resulting error estimates are often dependent upon space and time. Different products targeting the same basic quantity can give some idea of the structural uncertainty in these products, and we strongly recommend using multiple versions. For example, for different estimates of the global mean surface temperature, anomalies can be found from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), the Hadley Centre, and NASA [6, 33, 90] that differ in processing and details but show a large amount of agreement at the large scale.
4.3.3  Satellite Retrievals
Since 1979, global and near- global observations of the Earth’s climate have 
been made from low- earth orbit and geostationary satellites. These obser-vations are based either on passive radiances (either emitted directly from the Earth, or via reflected solar radiation) or by active scanning via lasers or radars. These satellites, mainly operated by U.S. agencies (NOAA, NASA), the European Space Agency, and the Japanese program (JAXA), and data are generally available in near- real- time. There are a number of levels of data, ranging from raw radiances (Level 1), processed data as a function of time (Level 2), and gridded averaged data at the global scale (Level 3).
Satellite products do have specific and particular views of the climate 
system, which requires that knowledge of the “satellite- eye” view be incor-porated into any comparison of satellite data with other products. Many satellite products are available for specific instruments on specific plat-forms; synthesis products across multiple instruments and multiple  platforms are possible, but remain rare.
4.3.4  Paleoclimate Proxies
In- situ instrumental data only extends on a global basis to the mid- 19th 
century, although individual records can extend to the 17th or 18th century. For a longer term perspective, climate information must be extracted from so- called “proxy” archives, such as ice cores, ocean mud, lake sediments, tree rings, pollen records, caves, or corals, which retain information that is sometimes highly correlated to specific climate variables or events [41].
As with satellite data, appropriate comparisons often require a for-
ward model of the process by which climate information is stored and that Climate Informatics    ◾   87  
incorporates the multiple variables that influence any particular proxy [75]. 
However, the often dramatically larger signals that can be found in past cli-mates can overcome the increase in uncertainty due to spatial sparseness and nonclimatic noise, especially when combined in a multi- proxy approach [58]. Problems in paleoclimate are discussed in further detail in Section 4.8.
4.3.5  Reanalysis Products
Weather forecast models use as much observational data ( in- situ , remote 
sensing, etc.) as can be assimilated in producing 6-hour forecasts (the “analyses”), which are excellent estimates of the state of the climate at any one time. However, as models have improved over time, the time series of weather forecasts can contain trends related only to the change in model rather than changes in the real world. Thus, many of the weather forecast-ing groups have undertaken “re analyses” that use a fixed model to re process d a t a  f r o m  t h e  p a s t  i n  o r d e r  t o  h a v e  a  c o n s i s t e n t  v i e w  o f  t h e  r e a l  w o r l d  (see reanalyses.org for more details). This is somewhat equivalent to a physics- based interpolation of existing datasets and often provides the best estimate of the climate state over the instrumental period (e.g., ERA-Interim [16]).
However, not all variables in the re analyses are equally constrained 
by observational data. Thus, sea- level pressure and winds are well char-acterized, but precipitation, cloud fields, and surface fluxes are far more model dependent and thus are not as reliable. Additionally, there remain unphysical trends in the output as a function of changes in the observing network over time. In particular, the onset of large- scale remote sensing in 1979 imparts jumps in many fields that can be confused with real climate trends [105].
4.3.6  Global Climate Model (GCM) Output
Global climate models are physics- based simulations of the climate sys-
tem, incorporating (optionally) components for the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, land surface, vegetation, ice sheets, atmospheric aerosols and chem-istry, and carbon cycles. Simulations can either be transient in response to changing boundary conditions (such as hindcasts of the 20th century), or time  slices for periods thought to be relatively stable (such as the mid- Holocene 6,000 years ago). Variations in output can depend on initial con-ditions (because of the chaotic nature of the weather), the model used, or variations in the forcing fields (due to uncertainties in the time his-tory, say, of aerosol emissions). A number of coordinated programs, nota-bly the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), have organized 88   ◾   Computational Intelligent Data Analysis for Sustainable Development
coherent model experiments that have been followed by multiple climate 
modeling groups around the world and which are the dominant source for 
model output [96].
These models are used to define fingerprints of forced climate change 
that can be used in the detection and attribution of climate change [39], for hypothesis generation about linkages in the climate system, as test-beds for evaluating proposed real- world analyses [24], and, of course, future predictions [61]. Quantifying the structural uncertainty in model parameterizations or the model framework, the impact of known imper-fections in the realizations of key processes, and the necessity of compro-mises at small spatial or temporal scales are all important challenges.
4.3.7  Regional Climate Model (RCM) Output
Global models necessarily need to compromise on horizontal resolution. 
In order to incorporate more details at the local level (particularly regional topography), output from the global models or the global re analyses can be used to drive a higher- resolution, regional climate model. The large- scale fields can then be transformed to higher resolution using physical principles embedded in the RCM code. In particular, rainfall patterns that are very sensitive to the detailed topography are often far better modeled within the RCM than in the global- scale driving model. However, there are many variables to consider in RCMs—from variations in how the boundary field forcing is implemented and in the physics packages—and the utility of using RCMs to improve predictions of change is not yet clear. A coordinated experiment to test these issues is the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) [60].
4.4  SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS IN CLIMATE INFORMATICS
There are a number of different kinds of problems that climate scientists 
are working on where machine learning and computer science techniques may make a big impact. This is a brief description of a few examples (with discussion of related work in the literature) that typify these ideas, although any specific implementation mentioned should not be consid-ered the last word. This section provides short descriptions of several chal-lenging problems in climate informatics broadly defined. In Section 4.5 we present problems in climate data analysis. In subsequent sections we delve into more detail on some specific problems in climate informatics.Climate Informatics    ◾   89  
4.4.1  Parameterization Development
Climate models need to deal with the physics that occurs at scales smaller 
than any finite model can resolve. This can involve cloud formation, tur-bulence in the ocean, land surface heterogeneity, ice floe interactions, chemistry on dust particle surfaces, etc. This is dealt with by using parameterizations that attempt to capture the phenomenology of a spe-cific process and its sensitivity in terms of the (resolved) large scales. This is an ongoing task, and is currently driven mainly by scientists’ physical intuition and relatively limited calibration data. As observational data become more available, and direct numerical simulation of key pro-cesses becomes more tractable, there is an increase in the potential for machine learning and data mining techniques to help define new param-eterizations and frameworks. For example, neural network frameworks have been used to develop radiation models [50].
4.4.2  Using Multimodel Ensembles of Climate Projections
There are multiple climate models that have been developed and are 
actively being improved at approximately 25 centers across the globe. Each model shares some basic features with at least some other models, but each has generally been designed and implemented independently and has many unique aspects. In coordinated Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) (most usefully, the Coupled MIP (CMIP3, CMIP5), the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate MIP (ACCMIP), the PaleoClimate MIP (PMIP3), etc.), modeling groups have attempted to perform analogous simulations with similar boundary conditions but with multiple models. These “ensembles” offer the possibility of assessing what is robust across models, what are the roles of internal variability, structural uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty in assessing the different projections at different time and space scales, and multiple opportunities for model- observation comparisons. Do there exist skill metrics for model simulations of the present and past that are informative for future projections? Are there weighting strategies that maximize predictive skill? How would one explore this? These are questions that also come up in weather forecasts, or seasonal forecasts, but are made more difficult for the climate problem b e ca us e  o f  th e  l o n g  tim e s cal e s  in v o l v e d  [ 40 ,  9 7 ] .  S o m e  r e c e n t  w o r k  h as  applied machine learning to this problem with encouraging results [63].90   ◾   Computational Intelligent Data Analysis for Sustainable Development
4.4.3  Paleoreconstructions
Understanding how climate varied in the past before the onset of wide-
spread instrumentation is of great interest—not least because the climate changes seen in the paleo- record dwarf those seen in the 20th century and hence may provide much insight into the significant changes expected this century. Paleo- data is, however, even sparser than instrumental data and, moreover, is not usually directly commensurate with the instrumental record. As mentioned in Section 4.3, paleo- proxies (such as water isotopes, tree rings, pollen counts, etc.) are indicators of climate change but often have nonclimatic influences on their behavior, or whose relation to what would be considered more standard variables (such as temperature or pre-cipitation) is perhaps nonstationary or convolved. There is an enormous challenge in bringing together disparate, multi- proxy evidence to produce large- scale patterns of climate change [59], or from the other direction build enough “forward modeling” capability into the models to use the proxies directly as modeling targets [76]. This topic is discussed in further detail in Section 4.8.
4.4.4  Data Assimilation and Initialized Decadal Predictions
The primary way in which sparse observational data are used to construct 
complete fields is through data assimilation. This is a staple of weather fore-casts and various re analyses in the atmosphere and ocean. In many ways, this is the most sophisticated use of the combination of models and obser-vations, but its use in improving climate  predictions is still in its infancy. 
For weather timescales, this works well; but for longer term forecasts (seasons to decades), the key variables are in the ocean, not the atmosphere, and initializing a climate model so that the evolution of ocean variability models the real world in useful ways is very much a work in progress [44, 90]. First results have been intriguing, if not convincing, and many more examples are slated to come online in the new CMIP5 archive [61].
4.4.5  Developing and Understanding Perturbed 
Physics Ensembles (PPEs)
One measure of structural uncertainty in models is the spread among the 
different models from different modeling groups. But these models can-not be considered a random sample from the space of all possible models. Another approach is to take a single model and, within the code, vary mul-tiple (uncertain) parameters in order to generate a family of similar models Climate Informatics    ◾   91  
that nonetheless sample a good deal of the intrinsic uncertainty that arises 
in choosing any specific set of parameter values. These ”Perturbed Physics Ensembles” (PPEs) have been used successfully in the climateprediction.net and Quantifying Uncertainty in Model Predictions (QUMP) projects to generate controlled model ensembles that can be compared systemati-cally to observed data and make inferences [46, 64]. However, designing such experiments and efficiently analyzing sometimes thousands of simu-lations is a challenge, but one that will increasingly be attempted.
4.5  CLIMATE DATA ANALYSIS: PROBLEMS AND APPROACHES
Here we discuss some additional challenge problems in analyzing climate 
data. The rate of data acquisition via satellite network and re analyses proj-ects is very rap id. Similarly , the amoun t of model output is equally fast growing. Model- observation comparisons based on processes (i.e., the multivariate changes that occur in a single event [or collection of events], such as a North Atlantic storm, an ocean eddy, an ice floe melting event, a hurricane, a jet stream excursion, a stratospheric sudden warming, etc.) have the potential to provide very useful information on model credibility, physics, and new directions for parameterization improvements. However, data services usually deliver data in single- variable, spatially fixed, time- varying formats that make it very onerous to apply space and time filters to the collection of data to extract generic instances of the process in ques-tion. As a first step, algorithms for clustering data streams will be critical for clustering and detecting the patterns listed. There will also be the need to collaborate with systems and database researchers on the data chal-lenges mentioned here and in Section 4.11. Here we present several other problems to which cutting- edge data analysis and machine learning tech-niques are poised to contribute.
4.5.1  Abrupt Changes
Earth system processes form a nonlinear dynamical system and, as a result, 
changes in climate patterns can be abrupt at times [74]. Moreover, there is some evidence, particularly in glacial conditions, that climate tends to remain in relatively stable states for some period of time, interrupted by sporadic transitions (perhaps associated with so- called tipping points ) that 
delineate different climate regimes. Understanding the causes behind sig-nificant abrupt changes in climate patterns can provide a deeper under-standing of the complex interactions between Earth system processes. The 92   ◾   Computational Intelligent Data Analysis for Sustainable Development
first step toward realizing this goal is to have the ability to detect and iden-
tify abrupt changes from climate data.
Machine learning methods for detecting abrupt changes, such as 
extensive droughts that last for multiple years over a large region, should have the ability to detect changes with spatial and temporal persistence, and should be scalable to large datasets. Such methods should be able to detect well- known droughts such as the Sahel drought in Africa, the 1930s Dust Bowl in the United States, and droughts with similar characteristics where the climatic conditions were radically changed for a period of time over an extended region [23, 37, 78, 113]. A simple approach for detecting droughts is to apply a suitable threshold to a pertinent climate variable, such as precipitation or soil moisture content, and label low- precipitation regions as droughts. While such an approach will detect major events like the Sahel drought and dust bowls, it will also detect isolated events, such as low precipitation in one month for a single location that is clearly not an ab rupt change even t. Th us, the n umber of “false positives” from such a simple approach would be high, making subsequent study of each detected event difficult.
To identify drought regions that are spatially and temporally persistent, 
one can consider a discrete graphical model that ensures spatio temporal smoothness of identified regions. Consider a discrete Markov Random Field (MRF) with a node corresponding to each location at each time step and a meaningful neighborhood structure that determines the edges in the underlying graph G = (V,E)  [ 111 ]. Each node can be in one of two 
states: “normal” or “drought.” The maximum a posteriori (MAP) infer-ence problem in the MRF can be posed as

where θu,θuv are node- wise and edge- wise potential functions that, respec-
tively, encourage agreement with actual observations and agreement among neighbors; and is the state (i.e., “normal” or “drought”) at node u ∈ V. The MAP inference problem is an integer programming problem 
often solved using a suitable linear programming (LP) relaxation [70, 111].
Figure  4.1  shows results on drought detection over the past century 
based on the MAP inference method. For the analysis, the Climatic Research Climate Informatics    ◾   93  
Unit (CRU) precipitation dataset was used at 0.5° × 0.5° latitude- longitude 
spatial resolution from 1901 to 2006. The LP involved approximately 7 million variables and was solved using efficient optimization techniques. The method detected almost all well- known droughts over the past cen-tury. More generally, such a method can be used to detect and study abrupt changes for a variety of settings, including heat waves, droughts,

data, re analysis data, as well as model outputs as appropriate.

dependencies can be represented as climate networks [19, 20, 106, 107], where 
relevant variables or processes are represented as nodes and dependencies are captured as edges between them. Climate networks are a rich represen-tation for the complex processes underlying the global climate system, and can be used to understand and explain observed phenomena [95, 108].
A key challenge in the context of climate networks is to construct such 
networks from observed climate variables. From a statistical machine learning perspective, the climate network should reflect suitable dependen-cies captured by the joint distribution of the variables involved. Existing methods usually focus on a suitable measure derived from the joint distri-bution, such as the covariance or the mutual information. From a sample- based estimate of the pairwise covariance or mutual information matrix, one obtains the climate network by suitably thresholding the estimated matrix. Such approaches have already shown great promise, often identify-ing some key dependencies in the global climate system [43] (Figure 4.2).
Going forward, there are a number of other computational and algorith-
mic challenges that must be addressed to achieve more accurate representa-tions of the global climate system. For instance, current network construction methods do not account for the possibility of time- lagged correlations, yet we know that such relationships exist. Similarly, temporal autocorrelations and signals with varying amplitudes and phases are not explicitly handled. There is also a need for better balancing of the dominating signal of spatial autocorrelation with that of possible teleconnections (long- range dependen-cies across regions), which are often of high interest. In addition, there are many other processes that are well known and documented in the climate

science literature, and network representations should be able to incor-
porate this a priori  knowledge in a systematic manner. One of the initial 
motivations and advantages of these network- based approaches is their interpretability, and it will be critical that this property be retained as these various aspects are integrated into increasingly complex models and analysis methods.
4.5.3  Predictive Modeling: Mean Processes and Extremes
Predictive modeling of observed climatic phenomena can help in under-
standing key factors affecting a certain observed behavior. While the usual goal of predictive modeling is to achieve high accuracy for the response variable, for example, the temperature or precipitation at a given location, in the context of climate data analysis, identifying the covariates having the most significan t influence on the response is often more importan t. Thus, in addition to getting high predictive accuracy, feature selection will be a key focus of predictive modeling. Further, one needs to differentiate between mean processes and extremes, which are rather different regimes for the response variable. In practice, different covariates may be influenc-ing the response variable under different regimes and timescales.
In recent literature, important advances have been made in doing fea-
ture selection in the context of high- dimensional regression [66, 101]. For concreteness, consider the problem of predicting the mean temperature in Brazil based on multiple ocean variables over all ocean locations. While the number of covariates p runs into tens of thousands, the number of 
samples n based on monthly means over a few decades are a few hun-
dred to a few thousand. Standard regression theory does not extend to this n ≪ p scenario. Because the ocean variables at a particular location are 
naturally grouped, only a few such locations are relevant for the predic-tion, and only a few variables in each such location are relevant, one can pose the regression problem as a sparse group lasso problem [24, 25]:

where N is the number of ocean locations, m is the number of ocean vari-
ables in each location so that p = Nm , θ is the weight vector over all covari-
ates to be estimated, θg is the set of weights over variables at location g, 
and λ1, λ2 are nonnegative constants. The sparse group lasso regularizer Climate Informatics    ◾   97  
ensures that only few locations get non- zero weights, and even among 
these locations, only a few variables are selected. Figure  4.3 shows the locations and features that were consistently selected for the task of tem-perature prediction in Brazil.
4.6  SEASONAL CLIMATE FORECASTING
Seasonal climate forecasts are those beyond the time frame of standard 
weather forecasts (e.g., 2 weeks) out to a season or two ahead (up to 6 months). Fundamental questions concern what is (and is not) predictable and exactly how predictable it is. Addressing these questions also often gives a good indication of how to make a prediction in practice. These are difficult questions because much in the climate system is unpredict-able and the observational record is short. Methods from data mining and machine learning applied to observations and data from numerical cli-mate prediction models provide promising approaches. Key issues include finding components of the climate state- space that are predictable, and constructing useful associations between observations and corresponding predictions from numerical models.
4.6.1  What Is the Basis for Seasonal Forecasting?
The chaotic nature of the atmosphere and the associated sensitivity of 
numerical weather forecasts to their initial conditions is described by the well- known “butterfly effect”—that the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil could set off a tornado in Texas. Small errors in the initial state

of a numerical weather forecast quickly amplify until the forecast has no 
value. This sensitive dependence on initial conditions provides an expla-nation for the limited time horizon (a few days to a week) for which use-ful weather forecasts can be issued, and the belief until the early 1980s that seasonal forecasting was impossible [81]. This also explains why effort is needed to “ find the needle of predictability in the haystack of chaos. ” Given the limited predictability of weather, how is it that quantities such as precipitation and near- surface temperature are skillfully forecast sea-sons (3 to 6 months) in advance?
First, it should be noted that the format of climate predictions is differ-
ent from that of weather forecasts. Weather forecasts target the meteor-ological conditions of a particular day or hour. Climate predictions are made in terms of weather statistics over some time range. For instance, the most common quantities in current climate forecasts are 3-month (seasonal) averages of precipitation and near- surface temperature. Two fundamental facts about the Earth system make climate forecasts pos-sible. First, the oceans evolve on timescales that are generally slower than those of the atmosphere, and some ocean structures are predictable sev-eral months in advance. The outstanding predictable ocean structure is associated with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and is manifest in the form of widespread, persistent departures (anomalies) of equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) from its seasonally adjusted long- term value. The first ENSO forecasts were made in the late 1980s [10]. The second fact is that some components of the atmosphere respond to per-sistent SST anomalies. The atmospheric response to SST on any given day tends to be small relative to the usual weather variability. However, because the SST forcing and the associated atmospheric response may persist for months or seasons, the response of a seasonal average to SST forcing may be significant [82]. For instance, ENSO has impacts on temperature, pre-cipitation, tropical cyclones, human health, and perhaps even conflict [31, 38, 49, 72]. Early seasonal forecasts constructed using canonical cor-relation analysis (CCA) between antecedent SST and climate responses [3] took advantage of this persistence of SST. Such statistical (or empirical, in the sense of not including explicit fundamental physical laws) forecasts remain attractive because of their generally low dimensional and cost rela-tive to physical process- based models (typically general circulation mod-els; GCMs) with many millions of degrees of freedom.Climate Informatics    ◾   99  
4.6.2  Data Challenges
Here we introduce some challenges posed by the available data. Data chal-
lenges are further discussed in Section 4.11. Serious constraints come from the dimensions of the available data. Reliable climate observations often do not extend more than 40 or 50 years into the past. This means that, for example, there may be only 40 or 50 available observations of January–March average precipitation. Moreover, the quality and completeness of that data may vary in time and space. Climate forecasts from GCMs often do not even cover this limited period. Many seasonal climate forecast systems started hindcasts in the early 1980s when satellite observations, particularly of SST , became available. In contrast to the sample size, the dimension of the GCM state- space may be of the order 10
6, depending 
on spatial grid resolution. Dimension reduction (principal component analysis [PCA] is commonly used) is necessary before applying classical methods like canonical correlation analysis to find associated features in predictions and observations [5]. There has been some use of more sophis-ticated dimensionality reduction methods in seasonal climate prediction problems [53]. Methods that can handle large state- spaces and small sam-ple size are needed. An intriguing recent approach that avoids the problem of small sample size is to estimate statistical models using long climate simulations unconstrained by observations and test the resulting model on observations [18, 115]. This approach has the challenge of selecting GCMs whose climate variability is “realistic,” which is a remarkably dif-ficult problem given the observational record.
4.6.3  Identifying Predictable Quantities
The initial success of climate forecasting has been in the prediction of sea-
sonal averages of quantities such as precipitation and near- surface tem-perature. In this case, time averaging serves as a filter with which to find predictable signals. A spatial average of SST in a region of the equatorial Pacific is used to define the NINO3.4 index, which is used in ENSO fore-casts and observational analysis. This spatial average serves to enhance the large- scale predictable ENSO signal by reducing noise. The Madden- Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a sub- seasonal component of climate variabil-ity that is detected using time and space filtering. There has been some work on constructing spatial filters that were designed to optimize mea-sures of predictability [17] and there are opportunities for new methods 100   ◾   Computational Intelligent Data Analysis for Sustainable Development
that incorporate optimal time and space filtering and that optimize more 
general measures of predictability.
While predicting the weather of an individual day is not possible in a 
seasonal forecast, it may be possible to forecast statistics of weather such as the frequency of dry days or the frequency of consecutive dry days. These quantities are often more important to agriculture than seasonal totals. Drought has a complex time- space structure that depends on multiple meteorological variables. Data mining and machine learning (DM/ ML) methods can be applied to observations and forecasts to identify drought, as discussed in Section 4.5.
Identification of previously unknown predictable climate features may

C l u s t e r  a n a l y s i s  o f  t r o p i c a l  cyclone tracks has been used to identify features that are associated with ENSO and MJO variability [9]. Graphical models, the nonhomogeneous Hidden Markov Model in particular, have been used to obtain stochastic daily sequences of rainfall conditioned on GCM seasonal forecasts [32].
The time and space resolution of GCM forecasts limits the physi-
cal phenomena they can resolve. However, they may be able to predict proxies or large- scale antecedents of relevant phenomena. For instance, GCMs that do not resolve tropical cyclones (TCs) completely do form TC- like structures that can be used to make TC seaso nal f o recasts [ 8, 1 1 0 ] . Identifying and associating GCMs “proxies” with observed phenomena is also a DM/ ML problem.
Regression methods are used to connect climate quantities to associ-

For instance, Poisson regression is used to relate large- scale cli-m a t e  q u an ti ti e s  wi th  h ur r i c an e s  [ 1 0 4 ] ,  an d  g e n e r al i z e d  a d di ti v e  m o d e l s  are used to relate heat waves with increased mortality [68]. Again, the length of the observational record makes this challenging.
4.6.4  Making the Best Use of GCM Data
Data from multiple GCM climate forecasts are routinely available. 
However, converting that data into a useful forecast product is a nontrivial task. GCMs have systematic errors that can be identified (and potentially corrected) through regression- like procedures with observations. Robust estimates of uncertainty are needed to construct probabilistic forecasts. Because forecasts are available from multiple GCMs, another question is how best to combine information from multiple sources, given the rela-tively short observation records with which to estimate model performance.Climate Informatics    ◾   101  
4.7  CLIMATE EXTREMES, UNCERTAINTY, AND IMPACTS
4.7 .1  The Climate Change Challenge

Climate Change (IPCC, AR4) has resulted in wider acceptance of global climate change caused by anthropogenic drivers of emission scenarios. However, earth system modelers struggle to develop precise predictions of extreme events (e.g., heat waves, cold spells, extreme rainfall events, droughts, hurricanes, and tropical storms) or extreme stresses (e.g., tropi-cal climate in temperate regions or shifting rainfall patterns) at regional and decadal scales. In addition, the most significant knowledge gap rel-evant for policy makers and stakeholders remains the inability to produce credible estimates of local- to- regional scale climate extremes and change impacts. Uncertainties in process studies, climate models, and associated spatiotemporal downscaling strategies may be assessed and reduced by statistical evaluations. But a similar treatment for extreme hydrological and meteorological events may require novel statistical approaches and improved downscaling. Scenario uncertainty for climate change impacts is fundamentally intractable, but other sources of uncertainty may be amenable to reduction. Regional impacts need to account for additional uncertainties in the estimates of anticipatory risks and damages, whether on the environment, infrastructures, economy, or society. The cascading un c e rt ain ti e s  fr o m  s c e n ari o s ,  t o  m o d e l s ,  t o  d o wn s calin g,  an d  fin all y  t o  impacts, make costly decisions difficult to assess. This problem grows acute if credible attributions must be made to causal drivers or policy impacts.
4.7 .2  The Science of Climate Extremes
One goal is to develop quantifiable insights on the impacts of global cli-
mate change on weather or hydrological extreme stresses and extreme events at regional to decadal scales. Precise and local predictions, for example, the likelihood of an extreme event on a given day of any given year a decade later, will never be achievable, owing to the chaotic nature of the climate system as well as the limits to precision of measurements and our inability to model all aspects of the process physics. However, probability density functions of the weather and hydrology, for example, likelihoods of intensity- duration- frequency (IDF) of extreme events or of mean change leading to extreme stress, may be achievable targets. The tools of choice range from the two traditional pillars of science: theory (e.g., advances in physical understanding and high- resolution process 102   ◾   Computational Intelligent Data Analysis for Sustainable Development
models of atmospheric or oceanic climate, weather, or hydrology) to 
experimentation (e.g., development of remote and in- situ  sensor systems 
as well as related cyber- infrastructures to monitor the Earth and environ-mental systems). However, perhaps the most significant breakthroughs are expected from the relatively new pillars: computational sciences and informatics. Research in the computational sciences for climate extremes science include the computational data sciences (e.g., high- performance analytics based on extreme value theory and nonlinear data sciences to develop predictive insights based on a combination of observations and climate model simulations) and computational modeling (e.g., regional scale climate models, models of hydrology, improvements in high- resolution processes within general circulation models, as well as feed-back to model development based on comparisons of simulations with observations), while the informatics aspects include data management and discovery (e.g., development of methodologies for geographic data integration and management, knowledge discovery from sensor data, and geospatial- temporal uncertainty quantification).
4.7 .3  The Science of Climate Impacts
The study of climate extremes is inextricably linked to the study of 
impacts, including risks and damage assessments as well as adaptation and mitigation strategies. Thus, an abnormally hot summer or high occur-rence of hurricanes in unpopulated or remote regions of the world, which do not otherwise affect resources or infrastructures, have little or no cli-mate impact on society. On the other hand, extreme events such as the after effects of Hurricane Katrina have extreme impacts owing to complex interactions among multiple effects: a large hurricane hitting an urban area, an already vulnerable levee breaking down because of the flood waters, as well as an impacted society and response systems that are nei-ther robust nor resilient to shocks. In general, climate change mitigation (e.g., emission policies and regulations to possible weather modification and geo engineering strategies) and adaptation (e.g., hazards and disaster preparedness, early warning and humanitarian assistance or the manage-ment of natural water, nutritional and other resources, as well as possible migration and changes in regional population growth or demographics) m ust be based o n acti o nab l e p r edi ctiv e ins igh ts tha t co ns i de r th e in te r -action of climate extremes science with the critical infrastructures and key resources, population, and society. While the science of impacts can be challenging and relatively difficult to quantify, given recent advances Climate Informatics    ◾   103  
in machine learning, geospatial modeling, data fusion, and Geographic 
Information Systems (GIS), this is a fertile area for progress on cli-mate informatics.
4.8  RECONSTRUCTING PAST CLIMATE
The most comprehensive observations of Earth’s climate span only the 
past one to two hundred years [105]. This time period includes the estab-lishment of long- term and widespread meteorological stations across the continental landmasses [6], ocean observing networks from ships and buoys [114] and, within the more recent past, remote sensing from satel-lites [109]. Much of our understanding about the climate system and con-temporary climate change comes from these and related observations and their fundamental role in evaluating theories and models of the climate system. Despite the valuable collection of modern observations, however, two factors limit their use as a description of the Earth’s climate and its variability: (1) relative to known timescales of climate variability, they span a brief period of time; and (2) much of the modern observational interval is during an emergent and anomalous climate response to anthro-pogenic emissions of greenhouse gases [36]. Both of these factors limit assessments of climate variability on multi- decadal and longer times-cales, or characterizations of climatic mean states under different forcing
* 
scenarios (e.g., orbital configurations or greenhouse gas concentrations). Efforts to estimate climate variability and mean states prior to the instru-mental period are thus necessary to fully characterize how the climate can change and how it might evolve in the future in response to increasing greenhouse gas emissions.
Paleoclimatology is the study of Earth’s climate history and offers 
estimates of climate variability and change over a range of timescales and climate regimes. Among the many time periods of relevance, the Common Era (CE; the past two millennia) is an important target because the abundance of high- resolution paleoclimatic proxies (e.g., tree rings, ice cores, cave deposits, corals, and lake sediments) over this time interval allows seasonal- to- annual reconstructions on regional- to- global spatial 
* A “forcing” is a specific driver of climate change, external to the climate models—for instance, changes in the composition of well- mixed greenhouse gases (e.g., CO
2 or CH4), changes in the 
land surface due to deforestation or urbanization, changes in air pollution, changes in the sun’s input, or the impact of large volcanic eruptions. Each forcing can be usefully characterized by the impact it has on the radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere: positive forcings increase the energy coming into the climate system and hence warm the planet, while negative forcings cool the climate.104   ◾   Computational Intelligent Data Analysis for Sustainable Development
scales [40]. The CE also spans the rise and fall of many human civiliza-
tions, making paleoclimatic information during this time period impor-tant for understanding the complicated relationships between climate and organized societies [7, 15].
Given the broad utility and vast number of proxy systems that are 
involved, the study of CE climate is a wide- ranging and diverse enterprise. The purpose of the following discussion is not meant to survey this field as a whole, but instead to focus on a relatively recent pursuit in CE paleo-climatology that seeks to reconstruct global or hemispheric temperatures using syntheses of globally distributed multi- proxy networks. This par-ticular problem is one that may lend itself well to new and emerging data analysis techniques, including machine learning and data mining meth-ods. The motivation of the following discussion therefore is to outline the basic reconstruction problem and describe how methods are tested in syn-thetic experiments.
4.8.1  The Global Temperature Reconstruction Problem
I t  i s  c o m m o n  t o  s e p a r a t e  g l o b a l  o r  h e m i s p h e r i c  ( l a r g e -  s c a l e )  t e m p e r a -
ture reconstruction methods into two categories. The first involves index methods that target large- scale indices such as hemispheric mean tem-peratures [13, 35, 51, 58]; the second comprises climate field reconstruc-tion (CFR) methods that target large- scale patterns, that is, global maps of temperature change [21, 55, 56, 59, 88]. Although both of these approaches often share common methodological foundations, the following discus-sion focuses principally on the CFR problem.
Large- scale temperature CFRs rely on two primary data sets. The first is 
monthly or annual gridded (5° latitude × 5° longitude) temperature prod-ucts that have near- global coverage beginning in the mid- to- late 19th cen-tury. These gridded temperature fields have been derived from analyses of land- and sea- based surface temperature measurements from meteoro-logical stations, and ship- and buoy- based observing networks [6, 42]. The second dataset comprises collections of multiple climate proxy archives [58], each of which has been independently analyzed to establish their sen-sitivity to some aspect of local or regional climate variability. These proxy records are distributed heterogeneously about the globe (

span variable periods of time, and each is subject to proxy- specific errors and uncertainties.
The basic premise of CFR techniques is that a relationship can be deter-
mined between observed climate fields and multi- proxy networks during Climate Informatics    ◾   105  
their common interval of overlap. Once defined, this relationship can be 
used to estimate the climate fields prior to their direct measurement using the multi- proxy network that extends further into the past. Figure  4.4 represents this concept schematically using a data matrix that casts the CFR formalism as a missing data problem. Note that this missing data approach was originally proposed for CFRs using regularized expectation maximization [77], and has since become a common method for recon-structions targeting the CE [56, 57, 59]. The time- by- space data matrix in Figure 4.4 is constructed first from the instrumen tal data, with ro ws corresponding to years and columns corresponding to the number of grid cells in the instrumental field. For a typical CFR targeting an annual and global 5° × 5° temperature field, the time dimension is several centuries to multiple millennia, and the space dimension is on the order of one to two thousand grid cells. The time dimension of the data matrix is determined by the length of the calibration interval during which time the temper-ature observations are available, plus the reconstruction interval that is

determined by the length of available proxy records. The number of spatial 
locations may be less than the 2,592 possible grid cells in a 5° global grid, and depends on the employed surface temperature analysis product. A reconstruction method may seek to infill grid cells that are missing tem-perature observations [ 103], or simply leave them missing, depending on the number of years that they span [59]. The second part of the composite data matrix is formed from the multi- proxy network, the dimensions of which are determined by the longest proxy records and the total number of proxies (typically on the order of a few hundred to a thousand). The number of records in multi- proxy networks typically decreases back in time, and may reduce to a few tens of records in the earliest period of the reconstruction interval. The temporal resolution of the proxy series may also vary from seasonal to decadal.
Multiple methods have been used for CFRs, including a number of new 
and emerging techniques within Bayesian frameworks [52, 103]. The vast majority of CFRs to date, however, have applied forms of regularized, multi-variate linear regression, in which a linear regression operator is estimated during a period of overlap between the temperature and proxy matrices. Such linear regression approaches work best when the time dimension in the calibration interval (
Figure 4.4 ) is much larger than the spatial dimen-
sion, because the covariance between the temperature field and the prox-ies is more reliably estimated. The challenge for CFR methods involves the manner in which the linear regression operator is estimated in practi-cal situations when this condition is not met. It is often the case in CFR applications that the number of target variables exceeds the time dimen-sion, yielding a rank- deficient problem. The linear regression formalism therefore requires some form of regularization. Published linear methods for global temperature CFRs vary primarily in their adopted form of reg-ularization (see [88, 102] for general discussions on the methodological formalism). Matrix factorizations such as Singular Value Decomposition [29] of the temperature and proxy matrices are common first steps. If the squared singular values decrease quickly , as is often the case in climato-logical data where leading climate patterns dominate over many more weakly expressed local patterns or noise, reduced- rank representations of the temperature and proxy matrices are typically good approximations of the full- rank versions of the matrices. These reduced- rank temperature and proxy matrices therefore are used to estimate a linear regression oper-ator during the calibration interval using various multivariate regression techniques. Depending on the method used, this regression operator may Climate Informatics    ◾   107  
be further regularized based on analyses of the cross- covariance or cor-
relation of the reduced temperature and proxy matrices. Multiple means of selecting rank reductions at each of these steps have been pursued, such as selection rules based on analyses of the singular value (or eigenvalue) spectrum [57] or minimization of cross- validation statistics calculated for the full range of possible rank- reduction combinations [88].
4.8.2  Pseudoproxy Experiments
The literature is replete with discussions of the variously applied CFR 
methods and their performance (see [29] for a cogent summary of many employed methods). Given this large number of proposed approaches, it has become important to establish means of comparing methods using common datasets. An emerging tool for such comparisons is millennium- length, forced transient simulations from Coupled General Circulation Models (CGCMs) [1, 30]. These model simulations have been used as syn-thetic climates in which to evaluate the performance of reconstruction methods in tests that have been termed pseudoproxy experiments (see [85] for a review). The motivation for pseudoproxy experiments is to adopt a common framework that can be systematically altered and evaluated. They also provide a much longer, albeit synthetic, validation period than can be achieved with real- world data, and thus methodological evalua-tions can extend to lower frequencies and longer timescales. Although one must always be mindful of how the results translate into real- world impli-cations, these design attributes allow researchers to test reconstruction techniques beyond what was previously possible and to compare multiple methods on common datasets.
The basic approach of a pseudoproxy experiment is to extract a por-
tion of a spatio temporally complete CGCM field in a way that mimics the available proxy and instrumental data used in real- world reconstructions. The principal experimental steps proceed as follows: (1) pseudoinstru-mental and pseudoproxy data are sub sampled from the complete CGCM field from locations and over temporal periods that approximate their real- world data availability; (2) the time series that represent proxy infor-mation are added to noise series to simulate the temporal (and in some cases spatial) noise characteristics that are present in real- world proxy networks; and (3) reconstruction algorithms are applied to the model- sampled pseudo- instrumental data and pseudoproxy network to produce a reconstruction of the climate simulated by the CGCM. The culminating fourth step is to compare the derived reconstruction to the known model 108   ◾   Computational Intelligent Data Analysis for Sustainable Development
target as a means of evaluating the skill of the applied method and the 
uncertainties expected to accompany a real- world reconstruction product. Multi- method comparisons can also be undertaken from this point.
Multiple datasets are publicly available for pseudoproxy experiments 
through supplemental Websites of published papers [57, 87, 89, 103]. The Paleoclimate Reconstruction Challenge is also a newly established online portal through the Paleoclimatology Division of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration that provides additional pseudoproxy datasets.
* This collection of common datasets is an important 
resource for researchers wishing to propose new methodological applica-tions for CFRs, and is an excellent starting point for these investigations.
4.8.3  Climate Reconstructions and the Future
More than a decade of research on deriving large- scale temperature recon-
structions of the CE has yielded many insights into our past climate and established the utility of such efforts as a guide to the future. Important CFR improvements are nevertheless still necessary and leave open the potential for new analysis methods to have significant impacts on the field. Broad assessments of the multivariate linear regression framework have shown the potential for variance losses and mean biases in recon-structions on hemispheric scales [13, 51, 86], although some methods have demonstrated significant skill for reconstructions of hemispheric and global indices [57]. The spatial skill of CFRs, however, has been shown in pseudoproxy experiments to vary widely, with some regions showing significant errors [89]. Establishing methods with improved spatial skill is therefore an important target for alternative CFR approaches. It also is critical to establish rigorous uncertainty estimates for derived recon-structions by incorporating a more comprehensive characterization of known errors into the reconstruction problem. Bayesian and ensemble approaches lend themselves well to this task and constitute another open area of pursuit for new methodological applications. Process- based char-acterizations of the connection between climate and proxy responses also are becoming more widely established [2, 22, 76, 100]. These developments make it possible to incorporate physically based forward models as con-straints on CFR problems and further open the possibility of methodolog-ical advancement. Recent Bayesian studies have provided the groundwork 
* http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ paleo/ pubs/ pr- challenge/ pr- challenge.html.Climate Informatics    ◾   109  
for such approaches [52, 103], while paleoclimatic assimilation techniques 
have also shown promise [112].
In the context of machine learning, the problem of reconstructing parts 
of a missing data matrix has been widely studied as the matrix completion problem (see 
Figure  4.4 ). A popular example of the problem is encoun-
tered in movie recommendation systems, in which each user of a given system rates a few movies out of tens of thousands of available titles. The system subsequently predicts a tentative user rating for all possible movies, and ultimately displays the ones that the user might like. Unlike traditional missing value imputation problems where a few entries in a given data matrix are missing, in the context of matrix completion, one works with mostly missing entries (e.g., in movie recommendation sys-tems, 99% or more of the matrix is typically missing). Low- rank matrix factorization methods have been shown to be quite successful in such matrix completion problems [48, 73]. Further explorations of matrix com-pletion methods for the paleoclimate reconstruction problem therefore are fully warranted. This includes investigations into the applicability of exist-ing methods, such as probabilistic matrix factorization [73] or low- rank and sparse decompositions [ 114], as well as explorations of new methods that take into account aspects specific to the paleoclimate reconstruction. Methods that can perform completions along with a confidence score are more desirable because uncertainty quantification is an important desid-eratum for paleoclimate.

ological work in the field of CE paleoclimatology is aimed, in part, at better constraining natural climate variability on decadal- to- centennial timescales. This timescale of variability, in addition to expected forced changes, will be the other key contribution to observed climate during the 21st century. Whether we are seeking improved decadal predictions [93] or refined projections of 20th  century regional climate impacts [28], these estimates must incorporate estimates of both forced and natural variabil-ity. It therefore is imperative that we fully understand how the climate naturally varies across a range of relevant timescales, how it changes when forced, and how these two components of change may couple together. This understanding cannot be achieved from the modern instrumental record alone, and the CE is a strategic paleoclimate target because it pro-vides both reconstructions with high temporal and spatial resolution and an interval over which CGCM simulations are also feasible. Combining 110   ◾   Computational Intelligent Data Analysis for Sustainable Development
these two sources of information to assess model projections of future cli-
mate therefore is itself an important future area of discovery. Analyses that incorporate both the uncertainties in paleoclimatic estimates and the ensemble results of multiple model simulations will be essential for these assessments and is likely a key component of climate informatics as the field evolves into the future.
4.9  APPLICATIONS TO PROBLEMS IN POLAR REGIONS
Another potential application of machine learning concerns the impact 
of climate change at the poles and the interaction between the poles and climate in general. Because of the difficulty in collecting data from polar regions, the relatively expensive costs, and logistics, it is important to maximize the potential benefit deriving from the data. The paucity of s urf a c e -  m e as ur e d  da ta  i s  c o m p l e m e n t e d  b y  th e  ri c hn ess  an d  in c r e as in g  volume of either satellite/ airborne data and model outputs. In this regard, powerful tools are needed—not only to analyze, manipulate, and visual-ize large datasets, but also to search and discover new information from different sources—in order to exploit relationships between data and pro-cesses that are not evident or captured by physical models.
The number of applications of machine learning to study polar regions 
is not high although it has been increasing over the past decade. This is especially true in those cases when data collected from space borne sensors are considered. For example, Tedesco and colleagues [98, 99] use artificial neural networks (ANNs) or genetic algorithms to estimate snow param-eters from space borne microwave observations. Soh and Tsatsoulis [91] use an Automated Sea Ice Segmentation (ASIS) system that automatically segments Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sea ice imagery by integrating image processing, data mining, and machine learning methodologies. The system is further developed by Soh et al. [92], where an intelligent sys-tem for satellite sea ice image analysis called Advanced Reasoning using Knowledge for Typing Of Sea ice (ARKTOS) “mimicking the reason-ing process of sea ice experts” is presented. Lu and Leen [54] use semi- supervised learning to separate snow and non- snow areas over Greenland using a multispectral approach. Reusch [71] applies tools from the field of ANNs to reconstruct centennial- scale records of West Antarctic sea- ice variability using ice- core datasets from 18 West Antarctic sites and satellite- based records of sea ice. ANNs are used as a nonlinear tool to ice- core predictors to sea- ice targets such as sea salt chemistry to sea ice edge. One of the results from this study is that, in general, reconstructions Climate Informatics    ◾   111  
are quite sensitive to predictor used, and not all predictors appear to be 
useful. Finally, Gifford [27] shows a detailed study of team learning, col-laboration, and decision applied to ice- penetrating radar data collected in Greenland in May 1999 and September 2007 as part of a model- creation effort for sub glacial water presence classification.
The above- mentioned examples represent a few cases where machine

Although the number of studies appears to be increasing, likely because of both the increased research focusing on climate change and the poles and the increased computational power allowing machine learning tools to expand in their usage, they are still relatively rare com-pared to simpler but often less efficient techniques.
Machine learning and data mining can be used to enhance the value 
of the data by exposing information that would not be apparent from single- dataset analyses. For example, identifying the link between dimin-ishing sea ice extent and increasing melting in Greenland can be done through physical models attempting to model the connections between the two through the exchange of atmospheric fluxes. However, large- scale connections (or others at different temporal and spatial scales) might be revealed through the use of data- driven models or, in a more sophisticated fashion, through the combination of both physical and data- driven mod-els. Such an approach would, among other things, overcome the limitation of the physical models that, even if they represent the state- of- the- art in the corresponding fields, are limited by our knowledge and understanding of the physical processes. ANNs can also be used in understanding not only the connections among multiple parameters (through the analysis of the neurons connections), but also to understand potential temporal shifts in the importance of parameters on the overall process (e.g., increased importance of albedo due to the exposure of bare ice and reduced solid precipitation in Greenland over the past few years). Applications are not limited to a pure scientific analysis but also include the management of information, error analysis, missing linkages between databases, and improving data acquisition procedures.
In synthesis, there are many areas in which machine learning can 
support studies of the poles within the context of climate and climate change. These include climate model parameterizations and multimodel ensembles of projections for variables such as sea ice extent, melting in Greenland, and sea- level rise contribution, in addition to those discussed in previous sections.112   ◾   Computational Intelligent Data Analysis for Sustainable Development
4.10  TOWARD A CLIMATE INFORMATICS TOOLBOX
Recent additions to the toolbox of modern machine learning have consid-
erable potential to contribute to and greatly improve the prediction and inference capability for climate science. Climate prediction has significant challenges, including high dimensionality, multiscale behavior, uncer-tainty, and strong nonlinearity, and also benefits from having historical data and physics- based models. It is imperative that we bring all available, relevant tools to bear on the climate arena. In addition to the methods cited in Section 4.2 and in subsequent sections, here we briefly describe several other methods (some proposed recently) that one might consider to apply to problems in climate science.
We begin with CalTech and Los Alamos National Laboratory’s recently 
developed Optimal Uncertainty Quantification (OUQ) formalism [67, 79]. OUQ is a rigorous, yet practical, approach to uncertainty quantification that provides optimal bounds on uncertainties for a given, stated set of assumptions. For example, OUQ can provide a guarantee that the proba-bility that a physical variable exceeds a cut off is less than some value ϵ. This 
method has been successfully applied to assess the safety of truss struc-tures to seismic activity. In particular, OUQ can provide the maximum and minimum values of the probability of failure of a structure as a func-tion of earthquake magnitude. These probabilities are calculated by solv-ing an optimization problem that is determined by the assumptions in the problem. As input, OUQ requires a detailed specification of assumptions. One form of assumption may be (historical) data. The method’s poten-tial for practical use resides in a reduction from an infinite- dimensional, nonconvex optimization problem to a finite- (typically low) dimensional one. For a given set of assumptions, the OUQ method returns one of three answers: (1) Yes, the structure will withstand the earthquake with prob-ability greater than p; (2) No, it will not withstand it with probability p; or 
(3) Given the input, one cannot conclude either (i.e., undetermined). In the undetermined case, more/ different data/ assumptions are then required to say something definite. Climate models are typically infinite- dimensional dynamical systems, and a given set of assumptions will reduce this to a finite- dimensional problem. The OUQ approach could address such ques-tions as whether (given a potential scenario) the global mean temperature increase will exceed some threshold T, with some probability ϵ.
To improve the performance (e.g., reduce the generalization error) in 
statistical learning problems, it sometimes helps to incorporate domain Climate Informatics    ◾   113  
knowledge. This approach is particularly beneficial when there is limited 
data from which to learn, as is often the case in high- dimensional problems (genomics is another example). This general philosophy is described in a number of approaches such as learning with side information, Universum Learning [84], and learning from non- examples [83]. Learning with the Universum and learning from non- examples involve augmenting the available data with related examples from the same problem domain, but not necessarily from the same distribution. Quite often, the generalization error for predictions can be shown to be smaller for carefully chosen aug-mented data, but this is a relatively uncharted field of research and it is not yet known how to use this optimally. One can imagine using an ensemble of climate models in conjunction with data from model simulations to improve predictive capacity. How to optimally select Universum or non- examples is an open problem.
Domain knowledge in the form of competing models provides the basis 
of a game- theoretic approach of model selection [11]. This relates to recent work in applying algorithms for online learning with experts to combin-ing the predictions of the multi model ensemble of GCMs [63]. On his-torical data, this online learning algorithm’s average prediction loss nearly matched that of the best performing climate model. Moreover, the perfor-mance of the algorithm surpassed that of the average model prediction, which is a common state- of- the- art method in climate science. A major advantage of these approaches, as well as game- theoretic formulations, is their robustness, including the lack of assumptions regarding linearity and noise. However, because future observations are missing, algorithms f o r  u n s u p e r v i s e d  o r  s e m i -  s u p e r v i s e d  l e a r n i n g  w i t h  e x p e r t s  s h o u l d  b e  developed and explored.
Conformal prediction is a recently developed framework for learning 
based on the theory of algorithmic randomness. The strength of confor-mal prediction is that it allows one to quantify the confidence in a predic-tion [80]. Moreover, the reliability of the prediction is never overestimated. This is, of course, very important in climate prediction. To apply the suite of tools from conformal prediction, however, one needs to have iid (inde-pendent, identically distributed) or exchangeable data. While this is a serious restriction, one can imagine using iid computer simulations and checking for robustness. Conformal prediction is fairly easy to use and can be implemented as a simple wrapper to existing classifiers or regres-sion algorithms. Conformal prediction has been applied successfully in 114   ◾   Computational Intelligent Data Analysis for Sustainable Development
genomics and medical diagnoses. It is likely worthwhile to apply confor-
mal prediction to other complex problems in computational science.
Statistical Relational Learning [26] offers a natural framework for infer-
ence in climate. Included within this set of methods are graphical models [47], a flexible and powerful formalism with which to carry out inference for large, highly complex systems (some of which were discussed in Sections 4.5 and 4.6). At one extreme, graphical models can be derived solely from data. At the other extreme, graphical models provide a generalization of Kalman filters or smoothers, where data are integrated with a model. This general approach is quite powerful but requires efficient computation of conditional probabilities. As a result, one might explore how to adapt or extend the cur-rent suite of belief propagation methods to climate- specific problems.
Finally, for all of the above methods, it would be helpful if the learn-
ing algorithm could automatically determine which information or data it would be useful to get next. The “optimal learning” formalism addresses this question [69]. This gradient learning approach can be applied to a whole host of problems for learning where one has limited resources to allocate for information gathering. Optimal learning has been applied successfully to experiment design, in particular in the pharmaceutical industry, where it has the potential to reduce the cost (financial, time, etc.) of the drug discovery process. Optimal learning might be applied to climate science in order to guide the next set of observations and/ or the next simulations.
To conclude, there is a suite of recently developed machine learning 
methods whose applicability and usefulness in climate science should be explored. At this point, we have only begun to scratch the surface. If these m e t h o d s  p r o v e  s u c c e s s f u l  i n  c l i m a t e  s t u d i e s ,  w e  w o u l d  e x p e c t  t h e m  t o  apply elsewhere—where one has a model of the physical system and can access data.
4.11  DATA CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES 
IN CLIMATE INFORMATICS
Here we discuss additional challenges and important issues in analyzing 
climate data.
4.11.1  Issues with Cross- Class Comparisons
There is often a need to compare across different classes of data, whether to 
provide ground truth for a satellite retrieval or to evaluate a climate model prediction or to calibrate a proxy measurement. But because of the different characteristics of the data, comparing “apples to apples” can be difficult.Climate Informatics    ◾   115  
One of the recurring issues is the difference between internal variabil-
ity (or weather) and climate responses tied to a specific external forcing. The internal variability is a function of the chaotic dynamics in the atmo-sphere and cannot be predicted over time periods longer than 10 days or so (see Section 4.6). This variability, which can exist on all timescales, exists also in climate models; but because of the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, any unique simulation will have a different realization of the internal variability. Climate changes are then effectively defined as the ensemble mean response (i.e., after averaging out any internal vari-ability). Thus, any single realization (such as the real- world record) must be thought of as a forced signal (driven by external drivers) combined with a stochastic weather component.
The internal variability increases in relative magnitude as a function 
of decreasing time or spatial scale. Thus, comparisons of the specific time evolution of the climate system need to either take the variability into account or use specific techniques to minimize the difference from the real world. For instance, “nudged” simulations use observed winds from the re analyses to keep the weather in the model loosely tied to the observations. Simulations using the observed ocean temperatures as a boundary condition can do a good job of synchronizing the impacts of variability in the ocean on the atmospheric fields. Another way to mini-mize the impact of internal variability is to look for property- to- property correlations to focus on specific processes that, although they may occur at different points in time or space, can nonetheless be compared across models and observations.
Another issue is that model output does not necessarily represent exact 
topography or conditions related to an in- situ  o b s e r v a t i o n .  Th e  a v e r -
age height of a specific grid box might not correspond to the height of a mountain- based observing platform, or the resolved shape of the coastline might make a difference of 200 kilometers or so in the distance of a station to the shore. These issues can be alleviated to some extent if comparisons focus on large- scale gridded data. Another technique is to “downscale” the model output to specific locations, either statistically (based on observed correlations of a local record to larger- scale features of the circulation) or dynamically (using an embedded RCM). These methods have the poten-tial to correct for biases in the large- scale model, but many practical issues remain in assessing by how much.
Finally, observations are a function of a specific observing methodol-
ogy that encompasses technology, practice, and opportunity. These factors 116   ◾   Computational Intelligent Data Analysis for Sustainable Development
can impart a bias or skewness to the observation relative to what the real 
world may nominally be doing. Examples in satellite remote sensing are common—for example, a low cloud record from a satellite will only be able to see low clouds when there are no high clouds. Similarly, a satellite record of “mid- tropospheric” temperatures might actually be a weighted integral of temperatures from the surface to the stratosphere. A paleo-climate record may be of a quantity that while related to temperature or precipitation, may be a complex function of both, weighted towards a spe-cific season. In all these cases, it is often advisable to create a ‘forward model’ of the observational process itself to post- process the raw simula-tion output to create more commensurate diagnostics.
4.11.2  Climate System Complexity
A further issue arises in creating statistical models of the climate system 
because both the real  world and dynamical models have a large number of different physical variables.
Even simplified models can have hundreds of variables, and while not 
all of them are essential to determining the state of the system, one var-iable is frequently not sufficient. Land, atmosphere, and ocean processes all have different dominant timescales, and thus different components are essential at different scales. Some physical understanding is thus neces-sary to make the proper variable/ data choices, even with analysis schemes that extract structure from large datasets. Furthermore, these systems are chaotic, that is, initial conditions that are practically indistinguishable from each other in any given observing system will diverge greatly from each other on some short timescale. Thus, extracting useful predictions requires more than creating more accurate models—one needs to deter-mine which aspects are predictable and which are not.
4.11.3  Challenge: Cloud- Computing- Based Reproducible 
Climate Data Analysis
The study of science requires reproducible results: science is a body of 
work where the community strives to ensure that results are not from the unique abilities and circumstances of one particular person or group. T r a d i t i o n a l l y ,  t h i s  h a s  b e e n  d o n e  i n  l a r g e  p a r t  b y  p u b l i s h i n g  p a p e r s ,  but the scale of modern climate modeling and data analysis efforts has far outstripped the ability of a journal article to convey enough information to allow reproducibility. This is an issue both of size and of complexity: model results are much larger than can be conveyed in a few pages, and Climate Informatics    ◾   117  
both models and analysis procedures are too complex to be adequately 
described in a few pages.
The sheer size of GCMs and satellite datasets is also outstripping our 
traditional data storage and distribution methods: frequently, only a few variables from a model’s output are saved and distributed at high reso-lution, and the remaining model output is heavily averaged to generate datasets that are sufficiently small.
One promising approach to addressing these problems is cloud- 
computing- based reproducible climate data analysis. Having both the data and the analyses resident in the computational cloud allows the details of the computation to be hidden from the user; so, for example, data- intensive portions of the computation could be executed close to where the data resides. But these analyses must be reproducible, which brings not only technical challenges of archiving and finding, describing, and publishing analysis procedures, but also institutional challenges of ensuring that the large datasets that form the basis of these analyses remain accessible.
4.11.3.1  Data Scale
The size of datasets is rapidly outstripping the ability to store and serve the 
data. We have difficulty storing even a single copy of the complete archive of the CMIP3 model results, and making complete copies of those results and distributing them for analysis becomes both a large undertaking and limits the analysis to the few places that have data storage facilities of that scale. Analysis done by the host prior to distribution, such as averag-ing, reduces the size to something more manageable, but currently those reductions are chosen far in advance, and there are many other useful analyses that are not currently being done.
A cloud- based analysis framework would allow such reductions to be 
chosen and still executed on machines with fast access to the data.
4.11.3.2  Reproducibility and Provenance Graphs
A cloud- based analysis framework would have to generate reproducible 
documented results; that is, we would not only need the ability to rerun a calculation and know that it would generate the same results, but also know precisely what analysis had been done. This could be achieved, in part, by having standardized analysis schemes, so that one could be sure precisely what was calculated in a given data filter, and also important is system-atically tracking the full provenance of the calculation. This provenance 
graph , showing the full network of data filters and initial, intermediate, 118   ◾   Computational Intelligent Data Analysis for Sustainable Development
and final results, would provide the basis of both reproducibility and com-
munication of results. Provenance graphs provide the information neces-sary to rerun a calculation and get the same results; they also provide the basis of the full documentation of the results. This full network would need to have layers of abstraction so that the user could start with an over-all picture and then proceed to more detailed versions as needed.
4.12  CONCLUSION
The goal of this chapter is to inspire future work in the nascent field of 
climate informatics. We hope to encourage work not only on some of the challenge problems proposed here, but also on new problems. A profuse amount of climate data of various types is available, providing a rich and fertile playground for future machine learning and data mining research. Even exploratory data analysis could prove useful for accelerating discov-ery. To that end, we have prepared a climate informatics wiki as a result of the First International Workshop on Climate Informatics , which includes 
climate data links with descriptions, challenge problems, and tutorials on machine learning techniques [14]. We are confident that there are myriad collaborations possible at the intersection of climate science and machine learning, data mining, and statistics. We hope our work will encourage progress on a range of emerging problems in climate informatics.

ABSTRACT 
 Climate science is a big data  domain that is experiencing 
unprecedented growth. In our efforts to address the big data challenges of climate science, we are moving toward a 
notion of Climate Analytics- as-a-Service (CAaaS). CAaaS 
combines high-performance co mputing and data-proximal 
analytics with scalable data management, cloud computing virtualization, the notion of adaptive analytics, and a domain-harmonized API to improve the accessibility and usability of large collections of climate data.  MERRA Analytic Services (MERRA/A S) provides an example of 
CAaaS. MERRA/AS enables Ma pReduce analytics over 
NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) data collection. The MERRA reanalysis integrates observa tional data with numerical 
models to produce a global temporally and spatially 
consistent synthesis of key climate variables. The effectiveness of MERRA/AS has been demonstrated in several applications. In our e xperience, CAaaS is providing 
the agility required to meet our customers’ increasing and changing data management and data analysis needs.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The term ‘‘big data’’ is used to describe data sets that are 
too large or complex to be worked with using commonly-available tools [1]. Climate sc ience represents a big data 
domain that is experienci ng unprecedented growth [2]. 
Some of the major big data challenges facing climate science are easy to understand: large repositories mean that the data sets themselves cannot be moved: instead, analytical operations need to migrate to where the data reside; complex analyses over large repositories requires high-performance computing; large amounts of information 
increases the importance of metadata, provenance management, and discovery; migrating codes and analytic products within a growing network of storage and computational resources creates a need for fast networks, 
intermediation, and resource ba lancing; and, importantly, 
the ability to respond quickly to customer demands for new and often unanticipated uses for climate data requires greater agility in building and deploying applications [3]. It is useful to situate our big data challenges in this larger context, because doing so helps us understand where innovation can yield improvements.  
2. BACKGROUND 
 Our understanding of the Earth’s processes is based on a 
combination of observational data records and mathematical 
models. The size of NASA’s space-based observational data sets is growing dramatically as new missions come online. 
However a potentially bigger data challenge is posed by the work of climate scientists, whose models are regularly producing data sets of hundreds of terabytes or more [2, 4].  
The NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) 
provides state-of-the-art supe rcomputing and data services 
specifically designed for weather and climate research. The NCCS maintains advanced data capabilities and facilities that allow researchers within and beyond NASA to create and access the enormous volume of data generated by 
weather and climate models. Tackling the problems of data 
intensive science is an inherent part of the NCCS mission. 
There are two major challenges posed by the data 
intensive nature of climate sc ience. There is the need to 
provide complete lifecycle management of large-scale scientific repositories. This capability is the foundation upon which a variety of data services can be provided, from supporting active research to large-scale data federation, data publication and distributi on, and archival storage.

these large datasets are used: data analytics — the capacity 
to perform useful scientific analyses over large quantities of data in reasonable amounts of time. In many respects this is the biggest challenge: without effective means for transforming large scientific data collections into meaningful scientific knowledge, our mission fails. It is against this backdrop that the NCCS began looking at CAaaS as a potential element in our technological and organizational response to changing demands. 
 
3.  CLIMATE ANALYTICS AS A SERVICE 
 
We believe there are five essential technology elements that contribute to building Climate Analytics-as-a-Service: high-
performance, data-proximal analytics; scalable data management; cloud computing virtualization; adaptive 
analytics; and domain-harmonized APIs. In this section, we 
describe three of the more important of these elements; 
additional information can be found in [3]. 
 
3.1.  High-performance, data-proximal analytics  
 
Clearly, at its core, CAaaS must bring together data storage 
and high-performance computing in order to perform 
analyses over data where the data reside. MapReduce is of particular interest to us, because it provides an approach to high-performance analytics that is proving to be useful to many data intensive problems [5, 6]. MapReduce enables distributed computing on larg e data sets using high-end 
computers. It is an analys is paradigm that combines 
distributed storage and retrie val with distributed, parallel 
computation, allocating to the data repository analytical operations that yield reduced outputs to applications and interfaces that may reside elsewhere. Since MapReduce 
implements repositories as stor age clusters, data set size and 
system scalability are limited only by the number of nodes in the clusters. While MapReduce has proven effective for large repositories of textual data, its use in data intensive science applications has been limited, because many scientific data sets are inherently complex, have high dimensionality, and use binary formats. 
MapReduce distributes computations across large data 
sets using a large number of computers (nodes). In a “map” 
operation a head node takes the input, partitions it into smaller sub-problems, and distri butes them to data nodes. A 
data node may do this again in turn, leading to a multi-level 
tree structure. The data node processes the smaller problem, 
and passes the answer back to a reducer node to perform the reduction operation. In a “reduce” step, the reducer node then collects the answers to  all the sub-problems and 
combines them in some way to form the output — an answer to the problem it was originally trying to solve.   3.2.  Adaptive analytics  
 
Data intensive analysis workflows bridge between a largely 
unstructured mass of archived scientific data and the highly structured, tailored, reduced, and refined analytic products that are used by individual scientists and form the basis of 
intellectual work in the domain.  In general, the initial steps 
of an analysis, those operations that first interact with a data repository, tend to be the most general, while data manipulations closer to the client tend to be the most specialized to the individual, to  the domain, or to the science 
question under study. The amount of data being operated on also tends to be larger on the repository-side of the workflow, smaller toward the client-side end products. 
This stratification can be exploited in order to optimize 
efficiencies along the workfl ow chain. MapReduce, for 
example, seeks to improve effi ciencies of the near-archive 
operations that initiate workflows. In our work so far, we 
have focused on building a small set of canonical near-archive, early-stage analytical operations that represent a common starting point in many analysis workflows in many 
domains. For example, average,  variance, max, min, sum, 
count, and difference operations of the general form:  
result     avg(var, (t
0,t1), ((x 0,y0,z0),(x 1,y1,z1))), 
that return, in this example, the average value of a variable 
when given its name, a temporal extent, and a spatial extent. Because of their widespread use, we refer to these simple operations as ""canonical ops"" with which more complex analytic expressions can be built. They provide a template 
for users as they begin their exploration of MapReduce 
analytics and are useful in their own right as steps in larger analyses. We tend to think of them as a type of assembly language instruction for climate data analysis. 
The goal is to deploy the canonical ops within a 
framework that is able to capture their patterns of use and enable more complex analyses to be assembled and incorporated back into the system. The notion of engaging the broader community to deal with big data challenges has 
been used successfully in other settings, perhaps most notably with GalazyZoo, where a large user community is 
helping search the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for patterns and 
observations of potential scientific value [7]. We believe that this type of social ne tworking can play an important 
role in the future of climate analytics. The approach we are 
taking sets the stage for the community construction of new capabilities that are adapted to the socially expressed requirements of those who use the system.  
 
3.3.  Domain-harmonized APIs  
 
In order to knit these capabilities together and deliver them 
into practical use, we are building the Climate Data Services (CDS) application programming interface (API). APIs specify how software components interact with each other; 
they can take many forms, but the goal for all APIs is to 
make it easier to implement the abstract capabilities of a system. In building the CDS AP I, we are trying to provide 
for climate science a uniform semantic treatment of the combined functionalities of large-scale data management and data-proximal analytics. In doing so, we are combining concepts from the Open Ar chive Information Systems 
(OAIS) reference model, highly dynamic object-oriented 
programming APIs, and Web 2. 0 resource-oriented APIs. 
The OAIS reference model, defined by the Consultative 
Committee on Space Data Systems, addresses a full range of 
archival information preserva tion functions including ingest, 
archival storage, data management, access, and dissemination — full information lifecycle management. OAIS provides examples and some ""best practice"" recommendations and defines a minimal set of responsibilities for an archive to be called an OAIS [8]. These high-level services provi de a vocabulary that we have 
adopted for the CDS Reference Model and associated Library and API.  
The CDS Reference Model is a logical specification 
that presents a single abstract data and analytic services model to calling applications. The Reference Model can be 
implemented using various t echnologies; in all cases, 
however, actions are based on the following six primitives: 
Ingest  – Submit data to a service. 
Query  – Retrieve data from a service (synchronous). 
Order  – Request data from a service (asynchronous). 
Download  – Retrieve data from a service. 
Status  – Track progress of service activity. 
Execute  – Initiate a service-definable extension.   
Within this OAIS-inspired framework, we are creating 
a Python-based CDS Library th at contains methods that 
support the basic primitives (ingest, query, order, etc.) as 
well as extended utilities that combine the primitives into 
automated multi-step canonical ops  (avg, max, min, etc.).  
The Library sits atop a RESTfu l web services client that 
encapsulates inbound and outbound interactions with various climate data services. These provide the foundation upon which we have built a CDS command line interpreter (CLI) that supports interactive sessions. In addition, Python scripts and full Python applica tions also can use methods 
imported from the API. The re sulting client stack can be 
distributed as a software package or used to build a cloud-based service (SaaS) or distributable cloud image (PaaS).  
Unlike other APIs, our approach focuses on the specific 
analytic requirements of climate science and unites the 
language and abstractions of collections management with those of high-performance analytic s. Doing so reflects at the 
application level the confluence of storage and computation that is driving big data architectures of the future.  4.  MERRA ANALYTIC SERVICES 
 
MERRA Analytic Services (MERRA/AS) pull these 
elements together in an end-to-end demonstration of CAaaS capabilities. MERRA/AS enables MapReduce analytics over NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) data. The MERRA reanalysis integrates observational data with numerical models to 
produce a global temporally and spatially consistent synthesis of 26 key climate variables [9] . Spatial resolution 
is 1/2 ̊ latitude × 2/3 ̊ longitude × 72 vertical levels  
extending through the stratosphere. Temporal resolution is 
6-hours for three-dimensional, full spatial resolution, 
extending from 1979-present, nearly the entire satellite era. MERRA data are typically made available to the general public through NASA Earth Obse rving System Distributed 
Information System (EOS DIS). A subset of the data is made available to the climate research community through the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF), the research community's data publication infrastructure.  
We are focusing on the MERRA collection because 
there is an increasing demand for reanalysis data products by an expanding community of consumers, including local governments, federal agencies, and private-sector 
customers. Reanalysis data ar e used in models and decision 
support systems relating to disa sters, ecological forecasting, 
health and air quality, water re sources, agriculture, climate 
energy, oceans, and weather.  
In simple terms, our vision for MERRA/AS is that it 
allows MERRA data to be st ored in a Hadoop Distributed 
File System (HDFS) on a MERRA/AS cluster. Functionality is exposed through the CDS API. The API exposures enable a basic set of operations that can be used to build arbitrarily complex workflows and assembled into more complex operations (which can be folded back into the API and 
MERRA/AS service as further extensions). The 
complexities of the underlying (Java) mapper and reducer codes for the basic operations are encapsulated and abstracted away from the user, making these common operations easier to use. 
 
4.1.  The MERRA/AS analytics platform  The Apache Hadoop software library is the classic framework for MapReduce dist ributed analytics. We are 
using Cloudera, the 100% open source, enterprise-ready distribution of Apache Hadoop. Cl oudera is integrated with 
configuration and administra tion tools and related open 
source packages. The total size of the MERRA/AS HDFS repository is approximately 480 TB. MERRA/AS is running on a 36-node Dell cluster that has 576 Intel 2.6 GHz SandyBridge cores, 1300 TB of  raw storage, 1250 GB of 
RAM, and a 11.7 TF theoretical peak compute capacity. Nodes communicate through a Fourteen Data Rate (FDR) Infiniband network having peak TCP/IP speeds in excess of 
20 Gbps. 
The canonical operations that implement MERRA/AS’s 
average, variance, max, min,  sum, count, and difference 
calculations are Java MapReduce programs that are ultimately exposed as simple references to CDS Library methods or as web services e ndpoints. There is a substantial 
code ecosystem behind these apparently simple operations, nearly 6000 lines of Java code being offloaded from the user to the MERRA/AS service. 
 
4.2.  MERRA/AS in use 
 
Our initial exposure for client applications that wish to consume MERRA/AS results is the MERRA/AS Web Service. We are using a Repr esentational State Transfer 
(REST)-style architecture, which is the predominant web API design model. REST provides scalability of component interactions, accommodates interm ediaries like firewalls and 
proxies without the need to change interfaces, and allows independent deployment of components where implementations can change w ithout the need to change 
interfaces.  
In one application, MERRA/AS's web service is 
providing data to the RECOVER wildfire decision support 
system, which is being used for post-fire rehabilitation planning by Burned Area Em ergency Response (BAER) 
teams within the US Department of Interior and the US Forest Service. This capability has lead to the development of new data products based on c limate reanalysis data that 
until now were not available to the wildfire management community. 
In our largest deployment ex ercise to date, the CDS 
Client Distribution Package and the CDS API have been 
used by the iPlant Collaborative to integrate MERRA data 
and MERRA/AS functionality into the iPlant Discovery 
Environment. iPlant is a vi rtual organization created by a 
cooperative agreement funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) to create cyberi nfrastructure for the plant 
sciences. The project develops computing systems and software that combine computing resources, like those of TeraGrid, and bioinformatics and computational biology software. Its goal is easier collaboration among researchers with improved data access and processing efficiency. Primarily centered in the US, it collaborates internationally 
and includes a wide range of governmental and private-sector partners. 
MERRA/AS is currently in beta testing with about two 
dozen partners across a wide range of organizations and topic areas. Initial results have shown that analytic engine optimizations can yield near  real-time performance of 
MERRA/AS's canonical operations and that the total time required to assemble relevant data for many applications can be significantly reduced. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Climate data are generally move d to client applications for 
analysis and use. As climate model outputs increase in size and complexity, and as customer  demands for this important 
class of information increase, existing data practices in this domain must change. Rather than deliver data as a service, it will become necessary to deliver data analytics as a service. Our work suggests that such an approach offers great promise in efforts to address the big data challenges of the climate sciences.

Cenozoic temperature, sea level and CO 2covariations
provide insights into climate sensitivity to external
forcings and sea-level sensitivity to climate change.
Climate sensitivity depends on the initial climate
state, but potentially can be accurately inferred
from precise palaeoclimate data. Pleistocene climateoscillations yield a fast-feedback climate sensitivity
of 3±1
◦Cf o ra4 W m−2CO 2forcing if Holocene
warming relative to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)is used as calibration, but the error (uncertainty) is
substantial and partly subjective because of poorly
deﬁned LGM global temperature and possible humaninﬂuences in the Holocene. Glacial-to-interglacial
climate change leading to the prior (Eemian) interglacial
is less ambiguous and implies a sensitivity in the
upper part of the above range, i.e. 3–4

CO 2forcing. Slow feedbacks, especially change of ice
sheet size and atmospheric CO 2, amplify the total
Earth system sensitivity by an amount that depends
on the time scale considered. Ice sheet response time
is poorly deﬁned, but we show that the slow response
and hysteresis in prevailing ice sheet models are
exaggerated. We use a global model, simpliﬁed toessential processes, to investigate state dependence
of climate sensitivity , ﬁnding an increased sensitivity
towards warmer climates, as low cloud cover is
diminished and increased water vapour elevates the
tropopause. Burning all fossil fuels, we conclude,
would make most of the planet uninhabitable byhumans, thus calling into question strategies that
emphasize adaptation to climate change.

Humanity is now the dominant force driving changes in the Earth’s atmospheric composition and
climate [ 1]. The largest climate forcing today , i.e. the greatest imposed perturbation of the planet’s
energy balance [ 1,2], is the human-made increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs),
especially CO 2from the burning of fossil fuels.
Earth’s response to climate forcings is slowed by the inertia of the global ocean and the great
ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica, which require centuries, millennia or longer to approach
their full response to a climate forcing. This long response time makes the task of avoiding
dangerous human alteration of climate particularly difﬁcult, because the human-made climateforcing is being imposed rapidly , with most of the current forcing having been added in just the
past several decades. Thus, observed climate changes are only a partial response to the current
climate forcing, with further response still ‘in the pipeline’ [ 3].
Climate models, numerical climate simulations, provide one way to estimate the climate
response to forcings, but it is difﬁcult to include realistically all real-world processes. Earth’s
palaeoclimate history allows empirical assessment of climate sensitivity , but the data have large
uncertainties. These approaches are usually not fully independent, and the most realistic eventual
assessments will be ones combining their greatest strengths.
We use the rich climate history of the Cenozoic era in the oxygen isotope record of ocean
sediments to explore the relation of climate change with sea level and atmospheric CO
2, inferring
climate sensitivity empirically . We use isotope data from Zachos et al. [4], which are improved
over data used in our earlier study [ 5], and we improve our prescription for separating the
effects of deep ocean temperature and ice volume in the oxygen isotope record as well as our
prescription for relating deep ocean temperature to surface air temperature. Finally , we use anefﬁcient climate model to expand our estimated climate sensitivities beyond the Cenozoic climate
range to snowball Earth and runaway greenhouse conditions.
2. OverviewofCenozoicclimateandouranalysisapproach
The Cenozoic era, the past 65.5 million years (Myr), provides a valuable perspective on climate
[5,6] and sea-level change [ 7], and Cenozoic data help clarify our analysis approach. The principal
dataset we use is the temporal variation of the oxygen isotope ratio ( δ18O relative to δ16O;ﬁgure 1 a
right-hand scale) in the shells of deep-ocean-dwelling microscopic shelled animals (foraminifera)in a near-global compilation of ocean sediment cores [ 4].δ
18O yields an estimate of the deep ocean
temperature ( ﬁgure 1 b), as discussed in §3. Note that coarse temporal resolution of δ18Od a t ai n
the intervals 7–17, 35–42 and 44–65 Myr reduces the apparent amplitude of glacial–interglacialclimate ﬂuctuations (see electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S1). We use additional proxy
measures of climate change to supplement the δ
18O data in our quantitative analyses.
Carbon dioxide is involved in climate change throughout the Cenozoic era, both as a climate
forcing and as a climate feedback. Long-term Cenozoic temperature trends, the warming up to
about 50 Myr before present (BP) and subsequent long-term cooling, are likely to be, at least in
large part, a result of the changing natural source of atmospheric CO 2, which is volcanic emissions
that occur mainly at continental margins due to plate tectonics (popularly ‘continental drift’);
tectonic activity also affects the weathering sink for CO 2by exposing fresh rock. The CO 2tectonic
source grew from 60 to 50 Myr BP as India subducted carbonate-rich ocean crust while moving
through the present Indian Ocean prior to its collision with Asia about 50 Myr BP [ 8], causing
atmospheric CO 2to reach levels of the order of 1000 ppm at 50 Myr BP [ 9]. Since then, atmospheric
CO 2declined as the Indian and Atlantic Oceans have been major depocentres for carbonate and
organic sediments while subduction of carbonate-rich crust has been limited mainly to small
regions near Indonesia and Central America [ 10], thus allowing CO 2to decline to levels as low
as 170 ppm during recent glacial periods [ 11]. A climate forcing due to a CO 2change from 1000
to 170 ppm is more than 10 W m−2, which compares with forcings of the order of 1 W m−2for on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 3rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................

of isotopically light carbon into the atmosphere and ocean [ 14]. The size of the carbon injection is
estimated from changes in the stable carbon isotope ratio13C/12C in sediments and from ocean
acidiﬁcation implied by changes in the ocean depth below which carbonate dissolution occurred.
The potential carbon source for hyperthermal warming that received most initial attention was
methane hydrates on continental shelves, which could be destabilized by sea ﬂoor warming [ 15].
Alternative sources include release of carbon from Antarctic permafrost and peat [ 16]. Regardless
of the carbon source(s), it has been shown that the hyperthermals were astronomically paced,spurred by coincident maxima in the Earth’s orbit eccentricity and spin axis tilt [ 17], which
increased high-latitude insolation and warming. The PETM was followed by successively weaker
astronomically paced hyperthermals, suggesting that the carbon source(s) partially recharged
in the interim [ 18]. A high temporal resolution sediment core from the New Jersey continental
shelf [ 19] reveals that PETM warming in at least that region began about 3000 years prior to a
massive release of isotopically light carbon. This lag and climate simulations [ 20] that produce on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 4rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................large warming at intermediate ocean depths in response to initial surface warming are consistent
with the concept of a methane hydrate role in hyperthermal events.
The hyperthermals conﬁrm understanding about the long recovery time of the Earth’s carbon
cycle [ 21] and reveal the potential for threshold or ‘tipping point’ behaviour with large amplifying
climate feedback in response to warming [ 22]. One implication is that if humans burn most of the
fossil fuels, thus injecting into the atmosphere an amount of CO 2at least comparable to that
injected during the PETM, the CO 2would stay in the surface carbon reservoirs (atmosphere,
ocean, soil, biosphere) for tens of thousands of years, long enough for the atmosphere, oceanand ice sheets to fully respond to the changed atmospheric composition. In addition, there is
the potential that global warming from fossil fuel CO
2could spur release of CH 4and CO 2
from methane hydrates or permafrost. Carbon release during the hyperthermals required several
thousand years, but that long injection time may have been a function of the pace of the
astronomical forcing, which is much slower than the pace of fossil fuel burning.
The Cenozoic record also reveals the ampliﬁcation of climate change that occurs with growth
or decay of ice sheets, as is apparent at about 34 Myr BP when the Earth became cool enough for
large-scale glaciation of Antarctica and in the most recent 3–5 Myr with the growth of Northern
Hemisphere ice sheets. Global climate ﬂuctuated in the 20 Myr following Antarctic glaciation withwarmth during the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO, 15 Myr BP) possibly comparable
to that at 34 Myr BP , as, for example, Germany became warm enough to harbour snakes and
crocodiles that require an annual temperature of about 20
◦C or higher and a winter temperature
more than 10◦C[ 23]. Antarctic vegetation in the MMCO implies a summer temperature of
approximately 11◦C warmer than today [ 24] and annual sea surface temperatures ranging from
0◦C to 11.5◦C[25].
Superimposed on the long-term trends, in addition to occasional hyperthermals, are continual
high-frequency temperature oscillations, which are apparent in ﬁgure 1 after 34 Myr BP , when
the Earth became cold enough for a large ice sheet to form on Antarctica, and are still more
prominent during ice sheet growth in the Northern Hemisphere. These climate oscillations have
dominant periodicities, ranging from about 20 to 400 kyr, that coincide with variations in theEarth’s orbital elements [ 26], speciﬁcally the tilt of the Earth’s spin axis, the eccentricity of the
orbit and the time of year when the Earth is closest to the Sun. The slowly changing orbit and tilt
of the spin axis affect the seasonal distribution of insolation [ 27], and thus the growth and decay
of ice sheets, as proposed by Milankovitch [ 28]. Atmospheric CO
2,C H 4and N 2O have varied
almost synchronously with global temperature during the past 800 000 years for which precise
data are available from ice cores, the GHGs providing an amplifying feedback that magniﬁes the
climate change instigated by orbit perturbations [ 29–31].
Ocean and atmosphere dynamical effects have been suggested as possible causes of some
climate change within the Cenozoic era; for example, topographical effects of mountain
building [ 32], closing of the Panama Seaway [ 33] or opening of the Drake Passage [ 34]. Climate
modelling studies with orographic changes conﬁrm signiﬁcant effects on monsoons and on
Eurasian temperature [ 35]. Modelling studies indicate that closing of the Panama Seaway
results in a more intense Atlantic thermohaline circulation, but only small effects on Northern
Hemisphere ice sheets [ 36]. Opening of the Drake Passage surely affected ocean circulation
around Antarctica, but efforts to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect on global temperature have relied on
speculation about possible effects on atmospheric CO 2[37]. Overall, there is no strong evidence
that dynamical effects are a major direct contributor to Cenozoic global temperature change.
We hypothesize that the global climate variations of the Cenozoic ( ﬁgure 1 ) can be understood
and analysed via slow temporal changes in Earth’s energy balance, which is a function of solar
irradiance, atmospheric composition (speciﬁcally long-lived GHGs) and planetary surface albedo.Using measured amounts of GHGs during the past 800 000 years of glacial–interglacial climate
oscillations and surface albedo inferred from sea-level data, we show that a single empirical ‘fast-
feedback’ climate sensitivity can account well for the global temperature change over that range
of climate states. It is certain that over a large climate range climate sensitivity must become a
strong function of the climate state, and thus we use a simpliﬁed climate model to investigate on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 5rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................the dependence of climate sensitivity on the climate state. Finally , we use our estimated state-
dependent climate sensitivity to infer Cenozoic CO 2change and compare this with proxy CO 2
data, focusing on the Eocene climatic optimum, the Oligocene glaciation, the Miocene optimumand the Pliocene.
3. DeepoceantemperatureandsealevelintheCenozoicera
Theδ18O stable isotope ratio was the ﬁrst palaeothermometer, proposed by Urey [ 38]a n d
developed especially by Emiliani [ 39]. There are now several alternative proxy measures of
ancient climate change, but the δ18Od a t a( ﬁgure 1 a)o fZ a c h o s et al. [4], a conglomerate of the
global ocean sediment cores, is well suited for our purpose as it covers the Cenozoic era withgood temporal resolution. There are large, even dominant, non-climatic causes of δ
18O changes
over hundreds of millions of years [ 40], but non-climatic change may be small in the past few
hundred million years [ 41] and is generally neglected in Cenozoic climate studies. The principal
difﬁculty in using the δ18O record to estimate global deep ocean temperature, in the absence of
non-climatic change, is that δ18O is affected by the global ice mass as well as the deep ocean
temperature.
We make a simple estimate of global sea-level change for the Cenozoic era using the near-
global δ18O compilation of Zachos et al. [4]. More elaborate and accurate approaches, including
use of models, will surely be devised, but comparison of our result with other approaches isinstructive regarding basic issues such as the vulnerability of today’s ice sheets to near-term global
warming and the magnitude of hysteresis effects in ice sheet growth and decay .
During the Early Cenozoic, between 65.5 and 35 Myr BP , the Earth was so warm that there was
little ice on the planet and the deep ocean temperature is approximated by [ 6]
T
do(◦C)=− 4δ18O+12 (for δ18O<1.75). (3.1)
Hansen et al. [5] made the approximation that, as the Earth became colder and continental ice
sheets grew, further increase in δ18O was due, in equal parts, to deep ocean temperature change
and ice mass change,
Tdo(◦C)=− 2(δ18O−4.25) (for δ18O>1.75). (3.2)
Equal division of the δ18O change into temperature change and ice volume change was suggested
by comparing δ18O at the endpoints of the climate change from the nearly ice-free planet at
35 Myr BP (when δ18O approx. 1.75) with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which peaked
approximately 20 kyr BP . The change of δ18O between these two extreme climate states (approx. 3)
is twice the change of δ18O due to temperature change alone (approx. 1.5), with the temperature
change based on the linear relation (3.1) and estimates of Tdo∼5◦Ca t3 5 M y r B P( ﬁgure 1 )a n d
approximately −1◦C at the LGM [ 42].
This approximation can easily be made more realistic. Although ice volume and deep ocean
temperature changes contributed comparable amounts to δ18O change on average over the full
range from 35 Myr to 20 kyr BP , the temperature change portion of the δ18O change must decrease
as the deep ocean temperature approaches the freezing point [ 43]. The rapid increase in δ18Oi n
the past few million years was associated with the appearance of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets,
symbolized by the dark blue bar in ﬁgure 1 a.
The sea-level change between the LGM and Holocene was approximately 120 m [ 44,45]. Thus,
two-thirds of the 180 m sea-level change between the ice-free planet and the LGM occurred
with formation of Northern Hemisphere ice (and probably some increased volume of Antarctic
ice). Thus, rather than taking the 180 m sea-level change between the nearly ice-free planet of34 Myr BP and the LGM as being linear over the entire range (with 90 m for δ
18O<3.25 and 90 m
forδ18O>3.25), it is more realistic to assign 60 m of sea-level change to δ18O 1.75–3.25 and 120 m
toδ18O>3.25. The total deep ocean temperature change of 6◦C for the change of δ18O from 1.75 on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 6rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................

Differences between our inferred sea-level chronology and that from the ice sheet model [ 46]
are relevant to the assessment of the potential danger to humanity from future sea-level rise.Our estimated sea levels have reached +5 to 10 m above the present sea level during recent
interglacial periods that were barely warmer than the Holocene, whereas the ice sheet model
yields maxima at most approximately 1 m above the current sea level. We ﬁnd the Pliocene sea
level varying between about +20 m and −50 m, with the Early Pliocene averaging about +15 m;
the ice sheet model has a less variable sea level with the Early Pliocene averaging about +8m .
A 15 m sea-level rise implies that the East Antarctic ice sheet as well as West Antarctica andGreenland ice were unstable at a global temperature no higher than those projected to occur this
century [ 1,48].
How can we interpret these differences, and what is the merit of our simple δ
18O scaling? Ice
sheet models constrained by multiple observations may eventually provide our best estimate of
sea-level change, but as yet models are primitive. Hansen [ 49,50] argues that real ice sheets are
more responsive to climate change than is found in most ice sheet models. Our simple scaling
approximation implicitly assumes that ice sheets are sufﬁciently responsive to climate change
that hysteresis is not a dominant effect; in other words, ice volume on millennial time scales isa function of temperature and does not depend much on whether the Earth is in a warming or
cooling phase. Thus, our simple transparent calculation may provide a useful comparison with
geological data for sea-level change and with results of ice sheet models.
We cannot ap r i o r i deﬁne accurately the error in our sea-level estimates, but we can compare
with geological data in speciﬁc cases as a check on reasonableness. Our results ( ﬁgure 2 ) yield two
instances in the past million years when sea levels have reached heights well above the currentsea level: +9.8 m in the Eemian (approx. 120 kyr BP , also known as Marine Isotope Stage 5e or
MIS-5e) and +7.1 m in the Holsteinian (approx. 400 kyr BP , also known as MIS-11). Indeed, these
are the two interglacial periods in the Late Pleistocene that traditional geological methods identify on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 8rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................as probably having a sea level exceeding that in the Holocene. Geological evidence, mainly coral
reefs on tectonically stable coasts, was described in the review of Overpeck et al. [51] as favouring
an Eemian maximum of +4 to more than 6 m. Rohling et al. [52] cite many studies concluding
that the mean sea level was 4–6 m above the current sea level during the warmest portion of the
Eemian, 123–119 kyr BP; note that several of these studies suggest Eemian sea-level ﬂuctuationsup to +10 m, and provide the ﬁrst continuous sea-level data supporting rapid Eemian sea-level
ﬂuctuations. Kopp et al. [53] made a statistical analysis of data from a large number of sites,
concluding that there was a 95% probability that the Eemian sea level reached at least +6.6 m
with a 67% probability that it exceeded 8 m.
The Holsteinian sea level is more difﬁcult to reconstruct from geological data because of its
age, and there has been a long-standing controversy concerning a substantial body of geologicalshoreline evidence for a +20 m Late Holsteinian sea level that Hearty and co-workers have found
on numerous sites [ 54,55] (numerous pros and cons are contained in the references provided in
our present paragraph). Rohling et al. [56] note that their temporally continuous Red Sea record
‘strongly supports the MIS-11 sea level review of Bowen [ 57], which also places MIS-11 sea
level within uncertainties at the present-day level’. This issue is important because both ice core
data [ 29] and ocean sediment core data (see below) indicate that the Holsteinian period was only
moderately warmer than the Holocene with similar Earth orbital parameters. We suggest that
the resolution of this issue is consistent with our estimate of the approximately +7 m Holsteinian
global sea level, and is provided by Raymo & Mitrovica [ 58], who pointed out the need to make
a glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) correction for post-glacial crustal subsidence at the places
where Hearty and others deduced local sea-level change. The uncertainties in GIA modelling ledRaymo & Mitrovica [ 58] to conclude that the peak Holsteinian global sea level was in the range
of +6 to 13 m relative to the present. Thus, it seems to us, there is a reasonable resolution of the
long-standing Holsteinian controversy , with substantial implications for humanity , as discussedin later sections.
We now address differences between our sea-level estimates and those from ice sheet models.
We refer to both the one-dimensional ice sheet modelling of de Boer et al. [46], which was used
to calculate sea level for the entire Cenozoic era, and the three-dimensional ice sheet model of
Bintanja et al. [59], which was used for simulations of the past million years. The differences
most relevant to humanity occur in the interglacial periods slightly warmer than the Holocene,including the Eemian and Hosteinian, as well as the Pliocene, which may have been as warm as
projected for later this century . Both the three-dimensional model of Bintanja et al. [59] and the
one-dimensional model of de Boer et al. [46] yield maximum Eemian and Hosteinian sea levels of
approximately 1 m relative to the Holocene. de Boer et al. [46] obtain approximately +8 m for the
Early Pliocene, which compares with our approximately +15 m.
These differences reveal that the modelled ice sheets are less susceptible to change in response
to global temperature variation than our δ
18O analysis. Yet the ice sheet models do a good job
of reproducing the sea-level change for climates colder than the Holocene, as shown in ﬁgure 2
and electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S2. One possibility is that the ice sheet models are
too lethargic for climates warmer than the Holocene. Hansen & Sato [ 60] point out the sudden
change in the responsiveness of the ice sheet model of Bintanja et al. [59] when the sea level reaches
today’s level (ﬁgs 3 and 4 of Hansen & Sato [ 60]) and they note that the empirical sea-level data
provide no evidence of such a sudden change. The explanation conceivably lies in the fact that
the models have many parameters and their operation includes use of ‘targets’ [ 46] that affect
the model results, because these choices might yield different results for warmer climates than
the results for colder climates. Because of the potential that model development choices might be
inﬂuenced by expectations of a ‘correct’ result, it is useful to have estimates independent of themodels based on alternative assumptions.
Note that our approach also involves ‘targets’ based on expected behaviour, albeit simple
transparent ones. Our two-legged linear approximation of the sea level (equations (3.3) and (3.4))
assumes that the sea level in the LGM was 120 m lower than today and that the sea level was 60 m
higher than today 35 Myr BP . This latter assumption may need to be adjusted if glaciers and ice on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 9rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................

caps in the Eocene had a volume of tens of metres of sea level. However, Miller et al. [61] conclude
that there was a sea level fall of approximately 55 m at the Eocene–Oligocene transition, consistent
with our assumption that Eocene ice probably did not contain more than approximately 10 m of
sea level.
Real-world data for the Earth’s sea-level history ultimately must provide assessment of sea-
level sensitivity to climate change. A recent comprehensive review [ 7] reveals that there are still
wide uncertainties about the Earth’s sea-level history that are especially large for time scales of
tens of millions of years or longer, which is long enough for substantial changes in the shape
and volume of ocean basins. Gasson et al. [7] plot regional (New Jersey) sea level (their ﬁg. 14)
against the deep ocean temperature inferred from the magnesium/calcium ratio (Mg/Ca) of
deep ocean foraminifera [ 62], ﬁnding evidence for a nonlinear sea-level response to temperature
roughly consistent with the modelling of de Boer et al. [46]. Sea-level change is limited for
Mg/Ca temperatures up to about 5◦C above current values, whereupon a rather abrupt sea-
level rise of several tens of metres occurs, presumably representing the loss of Antarctic ice.
However, the uncertainty in the reconstructed sea level is tens of metres and the uncertainty in
the Mg/Ca temperature is sufﬁcient to encompass the result from our δ18Op r e s c r i p t i o n ,w h i c h
has comparable contributions of ice volume change and deep ocean temperature change at the
Late Eocene glaciation of Antarctica. on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 10rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................Furthermore, the potential sea-level rise of most practical importance is the ﬁrst 15 m above
the Holocene level. It is such ‘moderate’ sea-level change for which we particularly question
the projections implied by current ice sheet models. Empirical assessment depends upon real-
world sea-level data in periods warmer than the Holocene. There is strong evidence, discussed
above, that the sea level was several metres higher in recent warm interglacial periods, consistentwith our data interpretation. The Pliocene provides data extension to still warmer climates. Our
interpretation of δ
18O data suggests that Early Pliocene sea-level change (due to ice volume
change) reached about +15 m, and it also indicates sea-level ﬂuctuations as large as 20–40 m.
Sea-level data for Mid-Pliocene warm periods, of comparable warmth to average Early Pliocene
conditions ( ﬁgure 3 ), suggest sea heights as great as +15–25 m [ 63,64]. Miller et al. [61]ﬁ n da
Pliocene sea-level maximum of 22 ±10 m (95% conﬁdence). GIA creates uncertainty in sea-level
reconstructions based on shoreline geological data [ 65], which could be reduced via appropriately
distributed ﬁeld studies. Dwyer & Chandler [ 64] separate Pliocene ice volume and temperature
in deep ocean δ18O via ostracode Mg/Ca temperatures, ﬁnding sea-level maxima and oscillations
comparable to our results. Altogether, the empirical data provide strong evidence against the
lethargy and strong hysteresis effects of at least some ice sheet models.
4. Surfaceairtemperaturechange
The temperature of most interest to humanity is the surface air temperature. A record of pastglobal surface temperature is required for empirical inference of global climate sensitivity . Given
that climate sensitivity can depend on the initial climate state and on the magnitude and sign
of the climate forcing, a continuous record of global temperature over a wide range of climate
states would be especially useful. Because of the singularly rich climate story in Cenozoic deep
ocean δ
18O(ﬁgure 1 ), unrivalled in detail and self-consistency by alternative climate proxies, we
use deep ocean δ18O to provide the ﬁne structure of Cenozoic temperature change. We use surface
temperature proxies from the LGM, the Pliocene and the Eocene to calibrate and check the relationbetween deep ocean and surface temperature change.
The temperature signal in deep ocean δ
18O refers to the sea surface where cold dense water
formed and sank to the ocean bottom, the principal location of deep water formation being theSouthern Ocean. Empirical data and climate models concur that surface temperature change is
generally ampliﬁed at high latitudes, which tends to make temperature change at the site of
deep water formation an overestimate of global temperature change. Empirical data and climatemodels also concur that surface temperature change is ampliﬁed over land areas, which tends to
make temperature change at the site of deep water an underestimate of the global temperature.
Hansen et al. [5] and Hansen & Sato [ 60] noted that these two factors were substantially offsetting,
and thus they made the assumption that benthic foraminifera provide a good approximation of
global mean temperature change for most of the Cenozoic era.
However, this approximation breaks down in the Late Cenozoic for two reasons. First, the deep
ocean and high-latitude surface ocean where deep water forms are approaching the freezing point
in the Late Cenozoic. As the Earth’s surface cools further, cold conditions spread to lower latitudes
but polar surface water and the deep ocean cannot become much colder, and thus the benthic
foraminifera record a temperature change smaller than the global average surface temperature
change [ 43]. Second, the last 5.33 Myr of the Cenozoic, the Pliocene and Pleistocene, was the
time that global cooling reached a degree such that large ice sheets could form in the Northern
Hemisphere. When a climate forcing, or a slow climate feedback such as ice sheet formation,
occurs in one hemisphere, the temperature change is much larger in the hemisphere with the
forcing (cf. examples in Hansen et al. [66]). Thus, cooling during the last 5.33 Myr in the Southern
Ocean site of deep water formation was smaller than the global average cooling.
We especially want our global surface temperature reconstruction to be accurate for the
Pliocene and Pleistocene because the global temperature changes that are expected by the
end of this century , if humanity continues to rapidly change atmospheric composition, are
of a magnitude comparable to climate change in those epochs [ 1,48]. Fortunately , sufﬁcient on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 11rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................information is available on surface temperature change in the Pliocene and Pleistocene to allow us
to scale the deep ocean temperature change by appropriate factors, thus retaining the temporal
variations in the δ18O while also having a realistic magnitude for the total temperature change
over these epochs.
Pliocene temperature is known quite well because of a long-term effort to reconstruct the
climate conditions during the Mid-Pliocene warm period (3.29–2.97 Myr BP) and a coordinated
effort to numerically simulate the climate by many modelling groups ([ 67] and papers referenced
therein). The reconstructed Pliocene climate used data for the warmest conditions found inthe Mid-Pliocene period, which would be similar to average conditions in the Early Pliocene
(ﬁgure 3 ). These boundary conditions were used by eight modelling groups to simulate Pliocene
climate with atmospheric general circulation models. Although atmosphere–ocean models havedifﬁculty replicating Pliocene climate, atmospheric models forced by speciﬁed surface boundary
conditions are expected to be capable of calculating global surface temperature with reasonable
accuracy . The eight global models yield Pliocene global warming of 3 ±1
◦C relative to the
Holocene [ 68]. This Pliocene warming is an ampliﬁcation by a factor of 2.5 of the deep ocean
temperature change.
Similarly , for the reasons given above, the deep ocean temperature change of 2.25◦C between
the Holocene and the LGM is surely an underestimate of the surface air temperature change.
Unfortunately , there is a wide range of estimates for LGM cooling, approximately 3–6◦C, as
discussed in §6. Thus, we take 4.5◦C as our best estimate for LGM cooling, implying an
ampliﬁcation of surface temperature change by a factor of two relative to deep ocean temperature
change for this climate interval.
We obtain an absolute temperature scale using the Jones et al. [69]e s t i m a t eo f1 4◦C as the
global mean surface temperature for 1961–1990, which corresponds to approximately 13.9◦Cf o r
the 1951–1980 base period that we normally use [ 70] and approximately 14.4◦C for the ﬁrst decade
of the twenty-ﬁrst century . We attach the instrumental temperature record to the palaeo data by
assuming that the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century exceeds the Holocene mean by 0.25 ±
0.25◦C. Global temperature probably declined over the past several millennia [ 71], but we suggest
that warming of the past century has brought global temperature to a level that now slightly
exceeds the Holocene mean, judging from sea-level trends and ice sheet mass loss. Sea level is
now rising 3.1 mm per year or 3.1 m per millennium [ 72], an order of magnitude faster than the
rate during the past several thousand years, and Greenland and Antarctica are losing mass at
accelerating rates [ 73,74]. Our assumption that global temperature passed the Holocene mean
a few decades ago is consistent with the rapid change of ice sheet mass balance in the past fewdecades [ 75]. The above concatenation of instrumental and palaeo records yields a Holocene mean
of 14.15
◦C and Holocene maximum (from ﬁve-point smoothed δ18O) of 14.3◦C at 8.6 kyr BP .
Given a Holocene temperature of 14.15◦C and LGM cooling of 4.5◦C, the Early Pliocene mean
temperature 3◦C warmer than the Holocene leads to the following prescription:
Ts(◦C)=2×Tdo+12.25◦C (Pleistocene) (4.1)
and
Ts(◦C)=2.5×Tdo+12.15◦C (Pliocene). (4.2)
This prescription yields a maximum Eemian temperature of 15.56◦C, which is approximately
1.4◦C warmer than the Holocene mean and approximately 1.8◦C warmer than the 1880–1920
mean. Clark & Huybers [ 76] ﬁt a polynomial to proxy temperatures for the Eemian, ﬁnding
warming as much as +5◦C at high northern latitudes but global warming of +1.7◦C ‘relative
to the present interglacial before industrialization’. Other analyses of Eemian data ﬁnd global sea
surface temperature warmer than the Late Holocene by 0.7 ±0.6◦C[77] and all-surface warming
of 2◦C[78], all in reasonable accord with our prescription.
Our ﬁrst estimate of global temperature for the remainder of the Cenozoic assumes that
/Delta1Ts=/Delta1Tdoprior to 5.33 Myr BP , i.e. prior to the Plio-Pleistocene, which yields a peak Tsof
approximately 28◦Ca t5 0 M y r B P( ﬁgure 4 ).

(EECO) [ 79–81]. Climate models are marginally able to reproduce this level of Eocene warmth,
but the models require extraordinarily high CO 2levels, for example 2240–4480 ppm [ 82]a n d
2500–6500 ppm [ 83], and the quasi-agreement between data and models requires an assumption
that some of the proxy temperatures are biased towards summer values. Moreover, taking theproxy sea surface temperature data for the peak Eocene period (55–48 Myr BP) at face value yields
a global temperature of 33–34
◦C (ﬁg. 3 of Bijl et al. [84]), which would require an even larger
CO 2amount with the same climate models. Thus, below we also consider the implications for
climate sensitivity of an assumption that /Delta1Ts=1.5×/Delta1Tdoprior to 5.33 Myr BP , which yields Ts
approximately 33◦C at 50 Myr BP (see electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S3).
5. Climatesensitivity
Climate sensitivity ( S) is the equilibrium global surface temperature change ( /Delta1Teq)i nr e s p o n s et o
a speciﬁed unit forcing after the planet has come back to energy balance,
S=/Delta1Teq
F, (5.1)
i.e. climate sensitivity is the eventual (equilibrium) global temperature change per unit forcing.
Climate sensitivity depends upon climate feedbacks, the many physical processes that come into
play as climate changes in response to a forcing. Positive (amplifying) feedbacks increase the
climate response, whereas negative (diminishing) feedbacks reduce the response.
We usually discuss climate sensitivity in terms of a global mean temperature response to a
4Wm−2CO 2forcing. One merit of this standard forcing is that its magnitude is similar to an
anticipated near-term human-made climate forcing, thus avoiding the need to continually scale
the unit sensitivity to achieve an applicable magnitude. A second merit is that the efﬁcacy of
forcings varies from one forcing mechanism to another [ 66]; so it is useful to use the forcing
mechanism of greatest interest. Finally , the 4 W m−2CO 2forcing avoids the uncertainty in the
exact magnitude of a doubled CO 2forcing [ 1,48] estimate of 3.7 W m−2for doubled CO 2,w h e r e a s
Hansen et al. [66] obtain 4.1 W m−2, as well as problems associated with the fact that a doubled
CO 2forcing varies as the CO 2amount changes (the assumption that each CO 2doubling has the
same forcing is meant to approximate the effect of CO 2absorption line saturation, but actually
the forcing per doubling increases as CO 2increases [ 66,85]).
Climate feedbacks are the core of the climate problem. Climate feedbacks can be confusing,
because in climate analyses what is sometimes a climate forcing is at other times a climate
feedback. A CO 2decrease from, say , approximately 1000 ppm in the Early Cenozoic to 170–
300 ppm in the Pleistocene, caused by shifting plate tectonics, is a climate forcing, a perturbation
of the Earth’s energy balance that alters the temperature. Glacial–interglacial oscillations of the
CO 2amount and ice sheet size are both slow climate feedbacks, because glacial–interglacial
climate oscillations largely are instigated by insolation changes as the Earth’s orbit and tilt of
its spin axis change, with the climate change then ampliﬁed by a nearly coincident change of
the CO 2amount and the surface albedo. However, for the sake of analysis, we can also choose
and compare periods that are in quasi-equilibrium, periods during which there was little changeof the ice sheet size or the GHG amount. For example, we can compare conditions averaged
over several millennia in the LGM with mean Holocene conditions. The Earth’s average energy
imbalance within each of these periods had to be a small fraction of 1 W m
−2. Such a planetary
energy imbalance is very small compared with the boundary condition ‘forcings’, such as changed
GHG amount and changed surface albedo that maintain the glacial-to-interglacial climate change.
(a) Fast-feedbacksensitivity:LastGlacialMaximum–Holocene
The average fast-feedback climate sensitivity over the LGM–Holocene range of climate states
can be assessed by comparing estimated global temperature change and climate forcing change on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 13rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................between those two climate states [ 3,86]. The appropriate climate forcings are the changes in long-
lived GHGs and surface properties on the planet. Fast feedbacks include water vapour, clouds,
aerosols and sea ice changes.
This fast-feedback sensitivity is relevant to estimating the climate impact of human-made
climate forcings, because the size of ice sheets is not expected to change signiﬁcantly in decadesor even in a century and GHGs can be speciﬁed as a forcing. GHGs change in response to climate
change, but it is common to include these feedbacks as part of the climate forcing by using
observed GHG changes for the past and calculated GHGs for the future, with calculated amounts
based on carbon cycle and atmospheric chemistry models.
Climate forcings due to past changes in GHGs and surface albedo can be computed for the
past 800 000 years using data from polar ice cores and ocean sediment cores. We use CO
2[87]a n d
CH 4[88] data from Antarctic ice cores ( ﬁgure 5 a) to calculate an effective GHG forcing as follows:
Fe(GHGs) =1.12[Fa(CO 2)+1.4Fa(CH 4)], (5.2)
where Fa is the adjusted forcing, i.e. the planetary energy imbalance due to the GHG change
after the stratospheric temperature has time to adjust to the gas change. Fe, the effective forcing,
accounts for variable efﬁcacies of different climate forcings [ 66]. Formulae for Fa of each gas are
given by Hansen et al. [89]. The factor 1.4 converts the adjusted forcing of CH 4to its effective
forcing, Fe, which is greater than Fa mainly because of the effect of CH 4on the tropospheric ozone
and the stratospheric water vapour [ 66]. The factor 1.12 approximates the forcing by N 2O changes,
which are not as well preserved in the ice cores but have a strong positive correlation with CO 2
and CH 4changes [ 90]. The factor 1.12 is smaller than the 1.15 used by Hansen et al. [91], and is
consistent with estimates of the N 2O forcing in the current Goddard Institute for Space Studies
(GISS) radiation code and that of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [ 1,48].
Our LGM–Holocene GHG forcing ( ﬁgure 5 c) is approximately 3 m−2, moderately larger than the
2.8 W m−2estimated by IPCC [ 1,48] because of our larger effective CH 4forcing.
Climate forcing due to surface albedo change is a function mainly of the sea level, which
implicitly deﬁnes ice sheet size. Albedo change due to LGM–Holocene vegetation change, much
of which is inherent with ice sheet area change, and albedo change due to coastline movement
are lumped together with ice sheet area change in calculating the surface albedo climate forcing.
An ice sheet forcing does not depend sensitively on the ice sheet shape or on how many ice
sheets the ice volume is divided among and is nearly linear in sea-level change (see electronicsupplementary material, ﬁgure S4, and [ 5]). For the sake of simplicity , we use the linear relation
in Hansen et al. [5] and electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S4; thus, 5 W m
−2between the
LGM and ice-free conditions and 3.4 W m−2between the LGM and Holocene. This scale factor
was based on simulations with an early climate model [ 3,92]; comparable forcings are found in
other models (e.g. see discussion in [ 93]), but results depend on cloud representations, assumed
ice albedo and other factors; so the uncertainty is difﬁcult to quantify . We subjectively estimate an
uncertainty of approximately 20%.
Global temperature change obtained by multiplying the sum of the two climate forcings in
ﬁgure 5 cby a sensitivity of 3 /4◦Cp e rW m−2yields a remarkably good ﬁt to ‘observations’
(ﬁgure 6 ), where the observed temperature is 2 ×/Delta1Tdo, with 2 being the scale factor required to
yield the estimated 4.5◦C LGM–Holocene surface temperature change. The close match is partly
a result of the fact that sea-level and temperature data are derived from the same deep ocean
record, but use of other sea-level reconstructions still yields a good ﬁt between the calculated and
observed temperature [ 5]. However, exactly the same match as in ﬁgure 6 is achieved with a fast-
feedback sensitivity of 1◦Cp e rWm−2if the LGM cooling is 6◦C or with a sensitivity of 0.5◦Cp e r
Wm−2if the LGM cooling is 3◦C.
Accurate data deﬁning LGM–Holocene warming would aid empirical evaluation of fast-
feedback climate sensitivity . Remarkably , the range of recent estimates of LGM–Holocene
warming, from approximately 3◦C[94] to approximately 6◦C[95], is about the same as at the time
of the CLIMAP [ 96] project. Given today’s much improved analytic capabilities, a new project to on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 14rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................

Mapping (PRISM) Pliocene data reconstruction [ 97,98] and Pliocene Model Intercomparison
Project (PlioMIP) model intercomparisons [ 67,68], could be beneﬁcial. In §7 b, we suggest that
a study of Eemian glacial–interglacial climate change could be even more deﬁnitive. Combined
LGM, Eemian and Pliocene studies would address an issue raised at a recent workshop [ 99]:
the need to evaluate how climate sensitivity varies as a function of the initial climate state. The
calculations below were initiated after the workshop as another way to address that question. on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 15rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................(b) Fast-feedbacksensitivity:statedependence
Climate sensitivity must be a strong function of the climate state. Simple climate models show
that, when the Earth becomes cold enough for the ice cover to approach the tropics, the amplifying
albedo feedback causes rapid ice growth to the Equator: ‘snowball Earth’ conditions [ 100 ]. Real-
world complexity , including ocean dynamics, can mute this sharp bifurcation to a temporarilystable state [ 101 ], but snowball events have occurred several times in the Earth’s history when
the younger Sun was dimmer than today [ 102 ]. The Earth escaped snowball conditions owing to
limited weathering in that state, which allowed volcanic CO
2to accumulate in the atmosphere
until there was enough CO 2for the high sensitivity to cause rapid deglaciation [ 103 ].
Climate sensitivity at the other extreme, as the Earth becomes hotter, is also driven
mainly by an H 2O feedback. As climate forcing and temperature increase, the amount of
water vapour in the air increases and clouds may change. Increased water vapour makes
the atmosphere more opaque in the infrared region that radiates the Earth’s heat to space,
causing the radiation to emerge from higher colder layers, thus reducing the energy emitted to
space. This amplifying feedback has been known for centuries and was described remarkably
well by Tyndall [ 104 ]. Ingersoll [ 105 ] discussed the role of water vapours in the ‘runaway
greenhouse effect’ that caused the surface of V enus to eventually become so hot that carbon
was ‘baked’ from the planet’s crust, creating a hothouse climate with almost 100 bars of
CO 2in the air and a surface temperature of about 450◦C, a stable state from which there
is no escape. Arrival at this terminal state required passing through a ‘moist greenhouse’
state in which surface water evaporates, water vapour becomes a major constituent of the
atmosphere and H 2O is dissociated in the upper atmosphere with the hydrogen slowly escaping
to space [ 106 ]. That V enus had a primordial ocean, with most of the water subsequently
lost to space, is conﬁrmed by the present enrichment of deuterium over ordinary hydrogen
by a factor of 100 [ 107 ], the heavier deuterium being less efﬁcient in escaping gravity
to space.
The physics that must be included to investigate the moist greenhouse is principally: (i)
accurate radiation incorporating the spectral variation of gaseous absorption in both the solarradiation and thermal emission spectral regions, (ii) atmospheric dynamics and convection with
no speciﬁcations favouring artiﬁcial atmospheric boundaries, such as between a troposphere
and stratosphere, (iii) realistic water vapour physics, including its effect on atmospheric massand surface pressure, and (iv) cloud properties that respond realistically to climate change.
Conventional global climate models are inappropriate, as they contain too much other detail
in the form of parametrizations or approximations that break down as climate conditions
become extreme.
We use the simpliﬁed atmosphere–ocean model of Russell et al. [108 ], which solves the same
fundamental equations (conservation of energy , momentum, mass and water substance, and the
ideal gas law) as in more elaborate global models. Principal changes in the physics in the current
version of the model are use of a step-mountain C-grid atmospheric vertical coordinate [ 109 ],
addition of a drag in the grid-scale momentum equation in both atmosphere and ocean based on
subgrid topography variations, and inclusion of realistic ocean tides based on exact positioning
of the Moon and Sun. Radiation is the k-distribution method of Lacis & Oinas [ 110 ] with
25k-values; the sensitivity of this speciﬁc radiation code is documented in detail by Hansen
et al. [111 ]. Atmosphere and ocean dynamics are calculated on 3
◦×4◦Arakawa C-grids. There
are 24 atmospheric layers. In our present simulations, the ocean’s depth is reduced to 100 mwith ﬁve layers so as to achieve a rapid equilibrium response to forcings; this depth limitation
reduces poleward ocean transport by more than half. Moist convection is based on a test of
moist static stability as in Hansen et al. [92]. Two cloud types occur: moist convective clouds,
when the atmosphere is moist statically unstable, and large-scale super-saturation, with cloud
optical properties based on the amount of moisture removed to eliminate super-saturation, with
scaling coefﬁcients chosen to optimize the control run’s ﬁt with global observations [ 108 ,112 ]. To
avoid long response times in extreme climates, today’s ice sheets are assigned surface properties on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 16rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................

of the tundra, thus allowing them to have a high albedo snow cover in cold climates but
darker vegetation in warm climates. The model, the present experiments and more extensive
experiments will be described in a forthcoming paper [ 112 ].
The equilibrium response of the control run (1950 atmospheric composition, CO 2approx.
310 ppm) and runs with successive CO 2doublings and halvings reveals that snowball Earth
instability occurs just beyond three CO 2halvings. Given that a CO 2doubling or halving is
equivalent to a 2% change in solar irradiance [ 66] and the estimate that solar irradiance was
approximately 6% lower 600 Ma at the most recent snowball Earth occurrence [ 113 ],ﬁgure 7
implies that about 300 ppm CO 2or less was sufﬁciently small to initiate glaciation at that time.
Climate sensitivity reaches large values at 8–32 ×CO 2(approx. 2500–10 000 ppm; ﬁgure 7 b).
High sensitivity is caused by increasing water vapour as the tropopause rises and diminishinglow cloud cover, but the sensitivity decreases for still larger CO
2as cloud optical thickness and
planetary albedo increase, as shown by Russell et al. [112 ]. The high sensitivity for CO 2less than
4×CO 2is due partly to the nature of the experiments (Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets being
replaced by the tundra). High albedo snow cover on these continents largely disappears between
1×CO 2and 4 ×CO 2, thus elevating the calculated fast-feedback sensitivity from approximately
4◦C to approximately 5◦C. In the real world, we would expect the Greenland and Antarctic ice
sheets to be nearly eliminated and replaced by partially vegetated surfaces already at 2 ×CO 2
(620 ppm) equilibrium climate. In other words, if the Greenland/Antarctic surface albedo change
were identiﬁed as a slow feedback, rather than as a fast-feedback snow effect as it is in ﬁgure 7 ,
the fast-feedback sensitivity at 1–4 ×CO 2would be approximately 4◦C. Thus, the sensitivity
approximately 8◦Cp e rC O 2doubling in the range of 8–32 ×CO 2is a very large increase over
sensitivity at smaller CO 2amounts.
How conﬁdent are we in the modelled fast-feedback sensitivity ( ﬁgure 7 b)? We suspect that
the modelled water vapour feedback may be moderately exaggerated, because the water vapour
amount in the control run exceeds observed amounts. In addition, the area of sea ice in the control
run exceeds observations, which may increase the modelled sensitivity in the 1–4 ×CO 2range.
On the other hand, we probably underestimate the sensitivity at very high CO 2amounts, because
our model (such as most climate models) does not change the total atmospheric mass as the CO 2
amount varies. Mass change due to conceivable fossil fuel loading (up to say 16 ×CO 2) is unlikely
to have much effect, but sensitivity is probably underestimated at high CO 2amounts owing to on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 17rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................self-broadening of CO 2absorption lines. The increased atmospheric mass is also likely to alter the
cloud feedback, which otherwise is a strongly diminishing feedback at very large CO 2amounts.
Atmospheric mass will be important after the Earth has lost its ocean and carbon is baked into
the atmosphere. These issues are being examined by Russell et al. [112 ].
Earth today , with approximately 1.26 times 1950 CO 2, is far removed from the snowball
state. Because of the increase in solar irradiance over the past 600 Myr and volcanic emissions,
no feasible CO 2amount could take the Earth back to snowball conditions. Similarly , a V enus-
like baked-crust CO 2hothouse is far distant because it cannot occur until the ocean escapes
to space. We calculate an escape time of the order of 108–109years even with the increased
stratospheric water vapour and temperature at 16 ×CO 2. Given the transient nature of a fossil
fuel CO 2injection, the continuing forcing required to achieve a terminal V enus-like baked-crust
CO 2hothouse must wait until the Sun’s brightness has increased on the billion year time scale.
However, the planet could become uninhabitable long before that.
The practical concern for humanity is the high climate sensitivity and the eventual climate
response that may be reached if all fossil fuels are burned. Estimates of the carbon content of all
fossil fuel reservoirs including unconventional fossil fuels such as tar sands, tar shale and various
gas reservoirs that can be tapped with developing technology [ 114 ] imply that CO 2conceivably
could reach a level as high as 16 times the 1950 atmospheric amount. In that event, ﬁgure 7
suggests a global mean warming approaching 25◦C, with much larger warming at high latitudes
(see electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S6). The result would be a planet on which humans
could work and survive outdoors in the summer only in mountainous regions [ 115 ,116 ]—and
there they would need to contend with the fact that a moist stratosphere would have destroyed
the ozone layer [ 117 ].
6. Earthsystemsensitivity
GHG and surface albedo changes, which we treated as speciﬁed climate forcings in evaluating
fast-feedback climate sensitivity , are actually slow climate feedbacks during orbit-instigated
Pleistocene glacial–interglacial climate swings. Given that GHG and albedo feedbacks are both
strong amplifying feedbacks, indeed accounting by themselves for most of the global Pleistocene
climate variation, it is apparent that today’s climate sensitivity on millennial time scales must be
substantially larger than the fast-feedback sensitivity .
Climate sensitivity including slow feedbacks is described as ‘Earth system sensitivity’ [ 118 –
120 ]. There are alternative choices for the feedbacks included in Earth system sensitivity .
Hansen & Sato [ 60] suggest adding slow feedbacks one by one, creating a series of increasingly
comprehensive Earth system climate sensitivities; speciﬁcally , they successively move climate-driven changes in surface albedo, non-CO
2GHGs and CO 2into the feedback category , at which
point the Earth system sensitivity is relevant to an external forcing such as changing solar
irradiance or human-made forcings. At each level, in this series, the sensitivity is state dependent.
Our principal aim here is to use Cenozoic climate change to infer information on the all-
important fast-feedback climate sensitivity , including its state dependence, via analysis of Earth
system sensitivity . CO 2is clearly the dominant forcing of the long-term Cenozoic cooling, in
view of the abundant evidence that CO 2reached levels of the order of 1000 ppm in the Early
Cenozoic [ 9], as discussed in the Overview above. Thus, our approach is to examine Earth system
sensitivity to CO 2change by calculating the CO 2history required to produce our reconstructed
Cenozoic temperature history for alternative state-independent and state-dependent climate
sensitivities. By comparing the resulting CO 2histories with CO 2proxy data, we thus assess the
most realistic range for climate sensitivity .
Two principal uncertainties in this analysis are (i) global temperature at the EECO
approximately 50 Myr BP and (ii) CO 2amount at that time. We use EECO approximately 28◦C
(ﬁgure 4 ) as our standard case, but we repeat the analysis with EECO approximately 33◦C( s e e
electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S3), thus allowing inference of how the conclusions
change if knowledge of Eocene temperature changes. on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 18rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................Similarly , our graphs allow the inferred climate sensitivity to be adjusted if improved
knowledge of CO 250 Myr BP indicates a value signiﬁcantly different from approximately
1000 ppm.
To clarify our calculations, let us ﬁrst assume that fast-feedback climate sensitivity is a constant
(state-independent) 3◦C for doubled CO 2(0.75◦Cp e rW m−2). It is then trivial to convert our
global temperature for the Cenozoic ( ﬁgure 4 a) to the total climate forcing throughout the
Cenozoic, which is shown in the electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S4 a, as are results
of subsequent steps. Next, we subtract the solar forcing, a linear increase of 1 W m−2over the
Cenozoic era due to the Sun’s 0.4% irradiance increase [ 121 ], and the surface albedo forcing due
to changing ice sheet size, which we take as linear at 5 W m−2for the 180 m sea-level change
from 35 Myr BP to the LGM. These top-of-the-atmosphere and surface forcings are moderate insize, compared with the total forcing over the Cenozoic, and partially offsetting, as shown in
the electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S4 b. The residual forcing, which has a maximum of
approximately 17 W m
−2just prior to 50 Myr BP , is the atmospheric forcing due to GHGs. Non-
CO 2GHGs contribute 25% of the total GHG forcing in the period of ice core measurements.
Atmospheric chemistry simulations [ 122 ] reveal continued growth of non-CO 2gases (N 2O, CH 4
and tropospheric O 3) in warmer climates, at only a slightly lower rate (1.7–2.3 W m−2for 4×CO 2,
which itself is approx. 8 W m−2). Thus, we take the CO 2forcing as 75% of the GHG forcing
throughout the Cenozoic in our standard case, but we also consider the extreme case in which
non-CO 2gases are ﬁxed and thus contribute no climate forcing.
AC O 2forcing is readily converted to the CO 2amount; we use the equation in table 1 of Hansen
et al. [89]. The resulting Cenozoic CO 2history required to yield the global surface temperature of
ﬁgure 4 ais shown in ﬁgure 8 afor state-independent climate sensitivity with non-CO 2GHGs
providing 25% of the GHG climate forcing. The peak CO 2in this case is approximately 2000 ppm.
If non-CO 2GHGs provide less than 25% of the total GHG forcing, then the inferred CO 2amount
would be even greater. Results for alternative sensitivities, as in ﬁgure 8 b, are calculated for a
temporal resolution of 0.5 Myr to smooth out glacial–interglacial CO 2oscillations, as our interest
here is in CO 2as a climate forcing.
We focus on the CO 2amount 50 Myr BP averaged over a few million years in assessing
the realism of our inferred CO 2histories, because CO 2variations in the Cenozoic remain very
uncertain despite the success of Beerling & Royer [ 9] in eliminating the most extreme outliers.
Beerling & Royer [ 9] ﬁnd a best-ﬁt CO 2at 50 Myr BP of about 1000 ppm—see their ﬁgure 1 ,w h i c h
also indicates that CO 2at 50 Myr BP was almost certainly in the range of 750–1500 ppm, even
though it is impossible to provide a rigorous conﬁdence interval.
We conclude that the average fast-feedback climate sensitivity during the Cenozoic is larger
than the canonical 3◦Cf o r2 ×CO 2(0.75◦Cp e rW m−2) that has long been the central estimate
for current climate. An average 4◦Cf o r2 ×CO 2(1◦Cp e rWm−2) provides a good ﬁt to the target
1000 ppm CO 2, but the sensitivity must be still higher if non-CO 2GHG forcings amplify the CO 2
by less than one-third, i.e. provide less than 25% of the total GHG forcing.
(a) State-dependentclimatesensitivity
More realistic assessment should account for the state dependence of climate sensitivity . Thus,
we make the same calculations for the state-dependent climate sensitivity of the Russell climatemodel, i.e. we use the fast-feedback climate sensitivity of ﬁgure 7 b. In addition, for the purpose
of assessing how the results depend upon climate sensitivity , we consider a second case in which
we reduce the Russell sensitivity of ﬁgure 7 bby the factor two-thirds.
The estimated 1000 ppm of CO
2at 50 Myr BP falls between the Russell sensitivity and two-
thirds of the Russell sensitivity , though closer to the full Russell sensitivity . If the non-CO 2GHG
forcing is less than one-third of the CO 2forcing, the result is even closer to the full Russell
sensitivity . With these comparisons at 50 Myr BP in mind, we can use ﬁgure 9 to infer the likely
CO 2amount at other times. The End-Eocene transition began at about 500 ppm and fell to about
400 ppm. The Mid-Miocene warmth, which peaked at about 15 Myr BP , required a CO 2increase on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 19rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................

of only a few tens of ppm with the Russell sensitivity , but closer to 100 ppm if the true sensitivity
is only two-thirds of the Russell sensitivity . The higher (full Russell) sensitivity requires much less
CO 2change to produce the Mid-Miocene warming for two reasons: (i) the greater temperature
change for a speciﬁed forcing and (ii) the smaller CO 2change required to yield a given forcing
from the lesser CO 2level of the higher sensitivity case. The average CO 2amount in the Early
Pliocene is about 300 ppm for the Russell sensitivity , but could reach a few tens of ppm higher ifthe true sensitivity is closer to two-thirds of the Russell sensitivity .
(b) ComparisonwithvandeWal et al.model
van de Wal et al. [123 ] used the same Zachos et al. [4]δ18O data to drive an inverse model
calculation, including an ice sheet model to separate ice volume and temperature, thus inferring
CO 2over the past 20 Myr. They ﬁnd an MMCO CO 2approximately 450 ppm, which falls between
the Russell and two-thirds Russell sensitivities ( ﬁgure 9 ). The van de Wal et al. [123 ]m o d e lh a s
a3 0◦C change in Northern Hemisphere temperature (their model is hemispheric) between the
MMCO and average Pleistocene conditions driven by a CO 2decline from approximately 450 ppm
to approximately 250 ppm, which is a forcing of approximately 3.5 W m−2. Thus, the implied
(Northern Hemisphere) Earth system sensitivity is an implausible approximately 35◦C for a
4Wm−2CO 2forcing. The large temperature change may be required to produce substantial sea-
level change in their ice sheet model, which we suggested above is unrealistically unresponsive on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 20rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................

inferring a fast-feedback sensitivity of only about 3◦Cp e rC O 2doubling.
(c) InferencesfromthePalaeocene–EoceneThermalMaximumandEarlyCenozoicclimate
Finally , we use the largest and best documented of the hyperthermals, the PETM, to test the
reasonableness of the Russell state-dependent climate sensitivity . Global warming in the PETM isreasonably well deﬁned at 5–6
◦C and the plausible range for carbon mass input is approximately
4000–7000 Pg C [ 14]. Given that the PETM carbon injection occurred over a period of a few
millennia, carbon cycle models suggest that about one-third of the carbon would be airborne
as CO 2following complete injection [ 21]. With a conversion factor of 1 ppm CO 2∼2.12 Gt C,
the 4000–7000 Gt C source thus yields approximately 630–1100 ppm CO 2.W ec a nu s e ﬁgure 10 ,
obtained via the same calculations as described above, to see how much CO 2is required to yield
a5◦C warming. The Russell sensitivity requires approximately 800 ppm CO 2for a 5◦Cw a r m i n g ,
whereas two-thirds of the Russell sensitivity requires approximately 2100 ppm CO 2. Given the
uncertainty in the airborne fraction of CO 2and possible non-CO 2gases, we cannot rule out the
two-thirds Russell sensitivity , but the full Russell sensitivity ﬁts plausible PETM carbon sources
much better, especially if the PETM warming is actually somewhat more than 5◦C( s e e ﬁgure 10
for quantitative implications).
This analysis is for Earth system sensitivity with CO 2as the forcing, as is appropriate for
the PETM because any carbon injected as CH 4would be rapidly oxidized to CO 2. Feedbacks on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 21rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................

in the PETM do not include large ice sheets, but non-CO 2GHGs are an unmeasured feedback. If a
warming climate increases the amount of N 2Oa n dC H 4in the air, the required carbon source for
a given global warming is reduced, because the amount of carbon in airborne CH 4is negligible.
Any non-CO 2GHG feedback increases the CO 2-forced Earth system sensitivity , potentially by a
large amount ( ﬁgure 10 ). The CO 2-forced Earth sensitivity is the most relevant climate sensitivity ,
not only for the PETM but for human-made forcings. Although present enhanced amounts of
airborne CH 4and N 2O are mostly a climate forcing, i.e. their increases above the pre-industrial
level are mainly a consequence of human-made sources, they also include a GHG feedback.
Climate sensitivity including this GHG feedback is the most relevant sensitivity for humanity
as the CO 2forcing continues to grow.
If the EECO global temperature exceeded 28◦C, as suggested by multi-proxy data taken at face
value (see above), climate sensitivity implied by the EECO warmth and the PETM warming is
close to the full Russell climate sensitivity (see electronic supplementary material, ﬁgures S7–S9).
We conclude that the existing data favour a climate sensitivity of at least two-thirds of the Russell
sensitivity , and probably closer to the full Russell sensitivity . That lower limit is just over 3◦Cf o r
2×CO 2for the range of climate states of immediate relevance to humanity ( ﬁgure 7 b).
7. Summarydiscussion
Covariation of climate, sea level and atmospheric CO 2through the Cenozoic era is a rich source of
information that can advise us about the sensitivity of climate and ice sheets to forcings, includinghuman-made forcings. Our approach is to estimate Cenozoic sea level and temperature from
empirical data, with transparent assumptions and minimal modelling. Our data are available in
the electronic supplementary material, allowing comparison with other data and model results.
(a) Sea-levelsensitivity
Hansen [ 49,50] argues that real ice sheets are more responsive to warming than in most ice
sheet models, which suggests that large ice sheets are relatively stable. The model of Pollard &
DeConto [ 124 ], for example, requires three to four times the pre-industrial CO 2amount to melt the
Antarctic ice sheet. This stability is, in part, a result of hysteresis: as the Earth warms, the ice sheet
size as a function of temperature does not return on the same path that it followed as temperature
fell and the ice sheet grew. We do not question the reality of mechanisms that cause ice sheet on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 22rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................hysteresis, but we suspect they are exaggerated in models. Thus, as an extreme alternative that
can be compared with ice sheet models and real-world data, we assume that hysteresis effects are
negligible in our approximation for sea level as a function of temperature.
Ice sheets in question are those on Greenland and Antarctica, ice sheets that could shrink with
future warming. Despite the stability of those ice sheets in the Holocene, there is evidence that sealevel was much more variable during the Eemian, when we estimate the peak global temperature
was only +1.0
◦C warmer than in the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century . Rohling et al. [52]
estimate an average rate of Eemian sea-level change of 1.4 m per century , and several studiesnoted above suggest that the Eemian sea level reached heights of +4–6 m or more relative to today .
The MMCO provides one test of hysteresis. Our sea-level approximation ( ﬁgure 2 ) suggests
that the Antarctic ice sheet nearly disappeared at that time. John et al. [125 ] provide support for
that interpretation, as well as evidence of numerous rises and falls of sea level by 20–30 m during
the Miocene. These variations are even larger than those we ﬁnd ( ﬁgure 2 ), but the resolution
of the δ
18O data we use is not adequate to provide the full amplitude of variations during that
period (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S1).
The Mid-Pliocene is a more important test of ice sheet variability . We ﬁnd sea-level ﬂuctuations
of at least 20–40 m, much greater than in ice sheet models ( ﬁgure 2 ), with global temperature
variations of only a few degrees. Independent analyses designed to separate ice volume and
temperature change, such as Dwyer & Chandler [ 64], ﬁnd sea-level maxima and variability
comparable to our estimates. Altogether, the empirical data support a high sensitivity of the
sea level to global temperature change, and they provide strong evidence against the seeming
lethargy and large hysteresis effects that occur in at least some ice sheet models.
(b) Fast-feedbackclimatesensitivity
Estimates of climate sensitivity cover a wide range that has existed for decades [ 1,48,99]. That
range measures our ignorance; it does not mean that climate response from a speciﬁed stateis stochastic with such inherent uncertainty . God (Nature) plays dice, but not for such large
amounts. Indeed, one implication of the tight ﬁt of calculated and measured temperature change
of the past 800 000 years ( ﬁgure 6 ) is that there is a single well-deﬁned, but unknown, fast-
feedback global climate sensitivity for that range of climate, despite large regional climate
variations and ocean dynamical effects [ 31].
Improved empirical data can deﬁne climate sensitivity much more precisely , provided that
climate-induced aerosol changes are included in the category of fast feedbacks (human-made
aerosol changes are a climate forcing). Empirical assessment of fast-feedback climate sensitivity
is obtained by comparing two quasi-equilibrium climate states for which boundary conditionclimate forcings (which may be slow feedbacks) are known. Aerosol changes between those
climate states are appropriately included as a fast feedback, not only because aerosols respond
rapidly to changing climate but also because there are multiple aerosol compositions, they
have complex radiative properties and they affect clouds in several ways, thus making accurate
knowledge of their glacial–interglacial changes inaccessible.
The temporal variation of the GHG plus surface albedo climate forcing closely mimics the
temporal variation of either the deep ocean temperature ( ﬁgure 6 ) or Antarctic temperature [ 5,31]
for the entire 800 000 years of polar ice core data. However, the temperature change must be
converted to the global mean to allow inference of climate sensitivity . The required scale factor
is commonly extracted from an estimated LGM–Holocene global temperature change, which,
however, is very uncertain, with estimates ranging from approximately 3
◦C to approximately
6◦C. Thus, for example, the climate sensitivity (1.7–2.6◦Cf o r2 ×CO 2) estimated by Schmittner
et al. [94] is due largely to their assumed approximately 3◦C cooling in the LGM, and in lesser part
to the fact that they deﬁned some aerosol changes (dust) to be a climate forcing.
Climate sensitivity extracted from Pleistocene climate change is thus inherently partly
subjective as it depends on how much weight is given to mutually inconsistent estimates
of glacial-to-interglacial global temperature change. Our initial assessment is a fast-feedback on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 23rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................sensitivity of 3 ±1◦Cf o r2 ×CO 2, corresponding to an LGM cooling of 4.5◦C, similar to the
2.2–4.8◦C estimate of PALAEOSENS [ 99]. This sensitivity is higher than estimated by Schmittner
et al. [94], partly because they included natural aerosol changes as a forcing. In addition, we
note that their proxies for LGM sea surface cooling exclude planktic foraminifera data, which
suggest larger cooling [ 126 ], and, as noted by Schneider von Deimling et al. [95], regions
that are not sampled tend to be ones where the largest cooling is expected. It should be
possible to gain consensus on a narrower range for climate sensitivity via a community project
for the LGM analogous to PRISM Pliocene data reconstruction [ 97,98] and PlioMIP model
intercomparisons [ 67,68].
However, we suggest that an even more fruitful approach would be a focused effort to
deﬁne the glacial-to-interglacial climate change of the Eemian period (MIS-5e). The Eemianavoids the possibility of signiﬁcant human-made effects, which may be a factor in the Holocene.
Ruddiman [ 127 ] suggests that deforestation and agricultural activities affected CO
2and CH 4in
the Holocene, and Hansen et al. [91] argue that human-made aerosols were probably important.
Given the level of Eemian warmth, approximately +1.8◦C relative to 1880–1920, with a climate
forcing similar to that for LGM–Holocene ( ﬁgure 5 ), we conclude that this relatively clean
empirical assessment yields a fast-feedback climate sensitivity in the upper part of the rangesuggested by the LGM–Holocene climate change, i.e. a sensitivity of 3–4
◦Cf o r2 ×CO 2. Detailed
study is especially warranted because Eemian warmth is anticipated to recur in the near term.
(c) Earthsystemsensitivity
We have shown that global temperature change over the Cenozoic era is consistent with
CO 2change being the climate forcing that drove the long-term climate change. Proxy CO 2
measurements are so variable and uncertain that we only rely on the conclusion that the CO 2
amount was of the order of 1000 ppm during peak Early Eocene warmth. That conclusion, inconjunction with a climate model incorporating only the most fundamental processes, constrains
average fast-feedback climate sensitivity to be in the upper part of the sensitivity range that is
normally quoted [ 1,48,99], i.e. the sensitivity is greater than 3
◦Cf o r2 ×CO 2. Strictly this Cenozoic
evaluation refers to the average fast-feedback sensitivity for the range of climates from ice ages
to peak Cenozoic warmth and to the situation at the time of the PETM. However, it would be
difﬁcult to achieve that high average sensitivity if the current fast-feedback sensitivity were not
at least in the upper half of the range of 3 ±1◦Cf o r2 ×CO 2.
This climate sensitivity evaluation has implications for the atmospheric CO 2amount
throughout the Cenozoic era, which can be checked as improved proxy CO 2measurements
become available. The CO 2amount was only approximately 450–500 ppm 34 Myr BP when large-
scale glaciation ﬁrst occurred on Antarctica. Perhaps more important, the amount of CO 2required
to melt most of Antarctica in the MMCO was only approximately 450–500 ppm, conceivably onlyabout 400 ppm. These CO
2amounts are smaller than suggested by ice sheet/climate models,
providing further indication that the ice sheet models are excessively lethargic, i.e. resistant to
climate change. The CO 2amount in the earliest Pliocene, averaged over astronomical cycles, was
apparently only about 300 ppm, and decreased further during the Pliocene.
(d) Runawaygreenhouse
Our climate simulations, using a simpliﬁed three-dimensional climate model to solve the
fundamental equations for conservation of water, atmospheric mass, energy , momentum andthe ideal gas law, but stripped to basic radiative, convective and dynamical processes, ﬁnds
upturns in climate sensitivity at the same forcings as found with a more complex global climate
model [ 66]. At forcings beyond these points the complex model ‘crashed’, as have other climate
models (discussed by Lunt et al. [83]). The upturn at the 10–20 W m
−2negative forcing has a
simple physical explanation: it is the snowball Earth instability . Model crashes for large positive
forcings are sometimes described as a runaway greenhouse, but they probably are caused by one on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 24rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................of the many parametrizations in complex global models going outside its range of validity , not by
a runaway greenhouse effect.
The runaway greenhouse effect has several meanings ranging from, at the low end, global
warming sufﬁcient to induce out-of-control amplifying feedbacks, such as ice sheet disintegration
and melting of methane hydrates, to, at the high end, a V enus-like hothouse with crustal carbonbaked into the atmosphere and a surface temperature of several hundred degrees, a climate state
from which there is no escape. Between these extremes is the moist greenhouse, which occurs
if the climate forcing is large enough to make H
2O a major atmospheric constituent [ 106 ]. In
principle, an extreme moist greenhouse might cause an instability with water vapour preventing
radiation to space of all absorbed solar energy , resulting in very high surface temperature and
evaporation of the ocean [ 105 ]. However, the availability of non-radiative means for vertical
transport of energy , including small-scale convection and large-scale atmospheric motions, must
be accounted for, as is done in our atmospheric general circulation model. Our simulations
indicate that no plausible human-made GHG forcing can cause an instability and runawaygreenhouse effect as deﬁned by Ingersoll [ 105 ], in agreement with the theoretical analyses of
Goldblatt & Watson [ 128 ].
On the other hand, conceivable levels of human-made climate forcing could yield the low-
end runaway greenhouse. A forcing of 12–16 W m
−2, which would require CO 2to increase by a
factor of 8–16 times, if the forcing were due only to CO 2change, would raise the global mean
temperature by 16–24◦C with much larger polar warming. Surely that would melt all the ice on
the planet, and probably thaw methane hydrates and scorch carbon from global peat deposits and
tropical forests. This forcing would not produce the extreme V enus-like baked-crust greenhouse
state, which cannot be reached until the ocean is lost to space. A warming of 16–24◦C produces
a moderately moist greenhouse, with water vapour increasing to about 1% of the atmosphere’s
mass, thus increasing the rate of hydrogen escape to space. However, if the forcing is by fossil
fuel CO 2, the weathering process would remove the excess atmospheric CO 2on a time scale of
104–105years, well before the ocean is signiﬁcantly depleted. Baked-crust hothouse conditions on
the Earth require a large long-term forcing that is unlikely to occur until the sun brightens by afew tens of per cent, which will take a few billion years [ 121 ].
(e) Globalhabitability
Burning all fossil fuels would produce a different, practically uninhabitable, planet. Let us ﬁrst
consider a 12 W m−2greenhouse forcing, which we simulated with 8 ×CO 2.I fn o n - C O 2GHGs
such as N 2Oa n dC H 4increase with global warming at the same rate as in the palaeoclimate
record and atmospheric chemistry simulations [ 122 ], these other gases provide approximately
25% of the greenhouse forcing. The remaining 9 W m−2forcing requires approximately 4.8 ×CO 2,
corresponding to fossil fuel emissions as much as approximately 10,000 Gt C for a conservative
assumption of a CO 2airborne fraction averaging one-third over the 1000 years following a peak
emission [ 21,129 ].
Our calculated global warming in this case is 16◦C, with warming at the poles approximately
30◦C. Calculated warming over land areas averages approximately 20◦C. Such temperatures
would eliminate grain production in almost all agricultural regions in the world [ 130 ]. Increased
stratospheric water vapour would diminish the stratospheric ozone layer [ 131 ].
More ominously , global warming of that magnitude would make most of the planet
uninhabitable by humans [ 132 ,133 ]. The human body generates about 100 W of metabolic heat
that must be carried away to maintain a core body temperature near 37◦C, which implies that
sustained wet bulb temperatures above 35◦C can result in lethal hyperthermia [ 132 ,134 ]. Today ,
the summer temperature varies widely over the Earth’s surface, but wet bulb temperature is more
narrowly conﬁned by the effect of humidity , with the most common value of approximately
26–27◦C and the highest approximately of 31◦C. A warming of 10–12◦C would put most of
today’s world population in regions with wet a bulb temperature above 35◦C[132 ]. Given the
20◦C warming we ﬁnd with 4.8 ×CO 2, it is clear that such a climate forcing would produce on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 25rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................intolerable climatic conditions even if the true climate sensitivity is signiﬁcantly less than the
Russell sensitivity , or, if the Russell sensitivity is accurate, the CO 2amount required to produce
intolerable conditions for humans is less than 4.8 ×CO 2. Note also that increased heat stress
due to warming of the past few decades is already enough to affect health and workplace
productivity at low latitudes, where the impact falls most heavily on low- and middle-incomecountries [ 135 ].
The Earth was 10–12
◦C warmer than today in the Early Eocene and at the peak of the
PETM ( ﬁgure 4 ). How did mammals survive that warmth? Some mammals have higher internal
temperatures than humans and there is evidence of evolution of surface-area-to-mass ratio to
aid heat dissipation, for example transient dwarﬁng of mammals [ 136 ] and even soil fauna [ 137 ]
during the PETM warming. However, human-made warming will occur in a few centuries, asopposed to several millennia in the PETM, thus providing little opportunity for evolutionary
dwarﬁsm to alleviate impacts of global warming. We conclude that the large climate change from
burning all fossil fuels would threaten the biological health and survival of humanity , making
policies that rely substantially on adaptation inadequate.
Let us now verify that our assumed fossil fuel climate forcing of 9 W m
−2is feasible. If we
assume that fossil fuel emissions increase by 3% per year, typical of the past decade and of theentire period since 1950, cumulative fossil fuel emissions will reach 10 000 Gt C in 118 years.
However, with such large rapidly growing emissions the assumed 33% CO
2airborne fraction is
surely too small. The airborne fraction, observed to have been 55% since 1950 [ 1], should increase
because of well-known nonlinearity in ocean chemistry and saturation of carbon sinks, implying
that the airborne fraction probably will be closer to two-thirds rather than one-third, at least for a
century or more. Thus, the fossil fuel source required to yield a 9 W m−2forcing may be closer to
5000 Gt C, rather than 10 000 Gt C.
Are there sufﬁcient fossil fuel reserves to yield 5000–10 000 Gt C? Recent updates of
potential reserves [ 114 ], including unconventional fossil fuels (such as tar sands, tar shale
and hydrofracking-derived shale gas) in addition to conventional oil, gas and coal, suggest
that 5 ×CO 2(1400 ppm) is indeed feasible. For instance, using the emission factor for coal
from IPCC [ 48], coal resources given by the Global Energy Assessment [ 114 ] amount to 7300–
11 000 Gt C. Similarly , using emission factors from IPCC [ 48], total recoverable fossil energy
reserves and resources estimated by GEA [ 114 ] are approximately 15 000 Gt C. This does not
include large ‘additional occurrences’ listed in ch. 7 of GEA [ 114 ]. Thus, for a multi-centennial
CO 2airborne fraction between one-third and two-thirds, as discussed above, there are more than
enough available fossil fuels to cause a forcing of 9 W m−2sustained for centuries.
Most of the remaining fossil fuel carbon is in coal and unconventional oil and gas. Thus, it
seems, humanity stands at a fork in the road. As conventional oil and gas are depleted, will we
move to carbon-free energy and efﬁciency—or to unconventional fossil fuels and coal? If fossil
fuels were made to pay their costs to society , costs of pollution and climate change, carbon-free
alternatives might supplant fossil fuels over a period of decades. However, if governments forcethe public to bear the external costs and even subsidize fossil fuels, carbon emissions are likely to
continue to grow, with deleterious consequences for young people and future generations.
It seems implausible that humanity will not alter its energy course as consequences of burning
all fossil fuels become clearer. Yet strong evidence about the dangers of human-made climate
change have so far had little effect. Whether governments continue to be so foolhardy as to allow
or encourage development of all fossil fuels may determine the fate of humanity .

13,"NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE  | ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION | www.nature.com/natureclimatechange  1Ground water is an almost ubiquitous source of generally 
high-quality fresh water. These characteristics promote its 
widespread development, which can be scaled and local -
ized to demand, obviating the need for substantial infrastructure1. 
Globally, ground water is the source of one third of all fresh -
water withdrawals, supplying an estimated 36%, 42% and 27% 
of the water used for domestic, agricultural and industrial pur -
poses, respectively2. In many environments, natural groundwater 
discharges sustain baseflow to rivers, lakes and wetlands during 
periods of low or no rainfall. Despite these vital contributions to 
human welfare and aquatic ecosystems, a paucity of studies on the 
relationship between climate and ground water severely restricted 
the ability of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) to assess interactions between ground water and climate 
change in both its third3 and fourth4 assessment reports. There has 
since been a marked rise in published research5–8 applying local- 
to global-scale modelling, as well as ground-based and satellite 
monitoring, which has considerably enhanced our understanding 
of interactions between ground water and climate. Here we build 
on  an earlier broad-based overview8 of the topic, and examine 
substantial recent advances. These include emerging knowledge 
of the direct and indirect (through groundwater use) effects of 
climate forcing — including climate extremes — on groundwater 
resources, as well as feedbacks between ground water and climate, 
such as the contribution of groundwater depletion to global sea-
level rise. Furthermore, we identify critical gaps in our under -
standing of the interactions between ground water and climate.
Influence of climate on groundwater systems
Climate variability and change influences groundwater systems 
both directly through replenishment by recharge and indirectly 
through changes in groundwater use. These impacts can be modi -
fied by human activity such as land-use change (LUC).
Palaeohydrological evidence.  The long-term responses of ground 
water to climate forcing, largely independent of human activity, 
can be detected from palaeohydrological evidence from regional 
aquifer systems in semi-arid and arid parts of the world (Fig. 1). 
Much of the ground water flowing in large sedimentary aquifers 
of the central United States (High Plains aquifer), Australia (Great 
Artesian basin), southern Africa (Kalahari sands) and North Africa 
(Nubian sandstone aquifer system) was recharged by precipitation 
thousands of years ago10–13. As evaporation and plant transpira -
tion consume soil moisture but leave chloride behind, substantial Ground water and climate change
Richard G. T aylor  et al. *
As the world’s largest distributed store of fresh water, ground water plays a central part in sustaining ecosystems and enabling 
human adaptation to climate variability and change. The strategic importance of ground water for global water and food secu -
rity will probably intensify under climate change as more frequent and intense climate extremes (droughts and floods) increase 
variability in precipitation, soil moisture and surface water. Here we critically review recent research assessing the impacts of 
climate on ground water through natural and human-induced processes as well as through groundwater-driven feedbacks on 
the climate system. Furthermore, we examine the possible opportunities and challenges of using and sustaining groundwater 
resources in climate adaptation strategies, and highlight the lack of groundwater observations, which, at present, limits our 
understanding of the dynamic relationship between ground water and climate.
accumulations of chloride in unsaturated soil profiles within these 
basins indicate that little (≤5 mm yr−1) or no recharge has since 
taken place14; which is the case across many of the basins. Stable 
isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen, together with concentrations of 
noble gases,  suggest that recharge occurred under cooler climates 
(≥5  °C cooler) before and occasionally during Late Pleistocene 
glaciation, with further local additions during the Early Holocene. 
Ground water that was recharged during cooler, wetter climates of 
the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene (≥5,000 years bp) is com -
monly referred to as ‘fossil ground water’ . As current groundwater 
recharge rates are responsible for at most a tiny fraction of total 
groundwater storage, fossil aquifers are storage dominated rather 
than recharge-flux dominated15. As such, their lifespan is deter -
mined by the rate of groundwater abstraction relative to exploit -
able storage. In these systems, robust estimates of groundwater 
storage and accurate records of groundwater withdrawals are of 
critical importance. Although fossil aquifers provide a reliable 
source of ground water that is resilient to current climate variabil -
ity, this non-renewable groundwater exploitation is unsustainable 
and is mined in a manner similar to oil16.
Direct impacts.  Natural  replenishment of ground water occurs 
from both diffuse rain-fed recharge and focused recharge via leak -
age from surface waters (that is, ephemeral streams, wetlands or 
lakes) and is highly dependent on prevailing climate as well as 
on land cover and underlying geology. Climate and land cover 
largely determine precipitation and evapotranspiration, whereas 
the underlying soil and geology (Fig.  1) dictate whether a water 
surplus (precipitation minus evapotranspiration)  can be transmit -
ted and stored in the subsurface. Modelled estimates of diffuse 
recharge globally17,18 range from 13,000 to 15,000 km3 yr−1, equiva -
lent to ~30% of the world’s renewable freshwater resources19 or a 
mean per capita groundwater recharge of 2,100 to 2,500 m3 yr−1. 
These estimates represent potential recharge fluxes as they are 
based on a water surplus rather than measured contributions to 
aquifers. Furthermore, these modelled global recharge fluxes do 
not include focused recharge, which, in semi-arid environments, 
can be substantial14,20.
Spatial variability in modelled recharge is related primarily to 
the distribution of global precipitation17,18. Over time, recharge 
is strongly influenced by climate variability — including climate 
extremes (droughts and floods) that are often related to modes of 
climate variability such as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 
at multiyear timescales and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Atlantic

During the recent multi-annual Millennium Drought in Australia, 
groundwater storage in the Murray–Darling basin declined sub -
stantially and continuously by ~100 ± 35 km3 from 2000 to 2007 in 
response to a sharp reduction in recharge23. In tropical Africa, 
heavy rainfall has been found to contribute disproportionately to 
recharge observed in borehole hydrographs21,24. Recharge in semi-
arid environments is often restricted to statistically extreme (heavy) 
rainfall17,25 that commonly generates focused recharge beneath 
ephemeral surface water bodies20,21,26. Recharge from heavy rain -
fall events is also associated with microbial contamination of shal -
low groundwater-fed water supplies and outbreaks of diarrhoeal 
diseases in both low- and high-income countries27. Wetter condi -
tions do not, however, always produce more groundwater recharge. 
Incidences of greater (×2.5) winter precipitation in the southwest 
United States  during ENSO years give rise to enhanced evapotran -
spiration from desert blooms that largely or entirely consume the 
water surplus28.
At high latitudes and elevations, global warming changes the 
spatial and temporal distribution of snow and ice. Warming results 
in less  snow accumulation and earlier melting of snow, as well as 
in more winter precipitation in the form of rain and an increased 
frequency of rain-on-snow events. The aggregate impact of these 
effects on recharge is not well resolved, but preliminary evidence29,30 
indicates that changes in snowmelt regimes tend to reduce the sea -
sonal duration and magnitude of recharge. Aquifers in mountain 
valleys show shifts in the timing and magnitude of: (1) peak ground -
water levels due to an earlier spring melt; and (2) low groundwater 
levels associated with longer and lower baseflow periods31 (Fig. 2). 
Summer low flows in streams may be exacerbated by declining 
groundwater levels, so that stream flow becomes inadequate to 
meet domestic and agricultural water requirements and to maintain ecological functions such as in-stream habitats for fish and other 
aquatic species31. The effects of receding alpine glaciers on ground -
water systems are also not well understood, yet the long-term loss of 
glacial storage is estimated to reduce similarly summer baseflow32. 
In the glaciated watersheds of the Himalayas, the impacts of large 
reductions in glacial mass and increased evaporation on groundwa -
ter recharge are projected to be offset by a rise in precipitation33. In 
permafrost regions, where recharge is at present ignored in global 
analyses17, coupling between surface-water and groundwater sys -
tems may be particularly enhanced by warming34. In areas of sea -
sonal or perennial ground frost, increased recharge is expected even 
though the absolute snow volume decreases35.
Human and indirect climate impacts.  Links between climate and 
ground water in the modern era are complicated by LUC, which 
includes, most pervasively, the expansion of rain-fed and irrigated 
agriculture. Managed agro-ecosystems do not respond to changes 
in precipitation in the same manner as natural ecosystems. Indeed, 
LUC may exert a stronger influence on terrestrial hydrology than 
climate change. During multi-decadal droughts in the West 
African Sahel in the latter half of the twentieth century, groundwa -
ter recharge and storage rose rather than declined owing to a coin -
cidental LUC from savannah to cropland that increased surface 
runoff through soil crusting and focused recharge via ephemeral 
ponds36. Much earlier in the twentieth century, LUC from natu -
ral ecosystems to rain-fed cropland in southeast Australia and the 
southwest United States similarly increased groundwater storage 
through increased recharge, but also degraded groundwater qual -
ity through the mobilization of salinity accumulated in unsatu -
rated soil profiles14. In both regions, recharge rates under cropland 
increased by one to two orders of magnitude37–39 compared with 
native perennial vegetation. North W est

water system through irrigation (Fig.  2). In 2000, irrigation 
accounted for ~70% of global freshwater withdrawals and ~90% 
of consumptive water use2. This large-scale redistribution of fresh 
water from rivers, lakes and ground water to arable land (Fig. 2) 
has led to: (1) groundwater depletion in regions with primarily 
groundwater-fed irrigation; (2) groundwater accumulation as a 
result of recharge from return flows from surface-water-fed irriga -
tion; and (3) changes in surface-energy budgets associated with 
enhanced soil moisture from irrigation. Irrigation has depleted 
groundwater storage in several semi-arid and arid environments 
including the North China Plain40, northwest India41 and the US 
High Plains42,43, but also in humid environments in Brazil44 and 
Bangladesh45 (Fig.  1) where abstraction is especially intense. 
During a recent (2006 to 2009) drought in the California Central 
Valley (Fig. 1), large-scale groundwater depletion occurred when 
the source of irrigation water shifted from surface water to predom -
inantly ground water. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment 
(GRACE) satellite data and ground-based observations revealed 
that groundwater storage declined by between 24 and 31 km3, a 
volume that is equivalent to the storage capacity of Lake Mead, the 
largest surface reservoir in the United States46,47. Thus, the indi -
rect effects of climate on ground water through changes in irriga -
tion demand and sources can be greater than the direct impacts 
of climate on recharge. Global-scale modelling2 highlights areas 
of recent (1998  to 2002) groundwater accumulation through 
irrigation return flows from surface-water-fed irrigation in the 
Nile basin of Egypt, Tigris–Euphrates basin of Iraq, Syria and 
Turkey, the lower Indus basin in Pakistan, and southeastern China 
(Fig.  3). In parts of the California Central Valley, surface-water 
irrigation since the 1960s has increased groundwater recharge by 
a factor of approximately seven, replenishing previously depleted 
aquifers and raising groundwater levels by up to 100 m (ref. 48). 
Increased recharge may not only degrade groundwater quality 
through the mobilization of salinity in soil profiles (discussed 
earlier) but also flush natural contaminants such as arsenic from 
groundwater systems49,50.
Future climate impacts on groundwater systems.  As irrigation 
dominates current groundwater use and depletion, the effects of 
future climate variability and change on ground water may be great -
est through indirect effects on irrigation-water demand. Substantial 
uncertainty persists about the impacts of climate change on mean 
precipitation from general circulation models (GCMs)51, but there 
is much greater consensus on changes in precipitation and tem -
perature extremes, which are projected to increase with intensifica -
tion of the global hydrological system52,53. Longer droughts may be 
interspersed with more frequent and intense rainfall events. These 
changes in climate may affect ground water initially and primar -
ily through changes in irrigation demand, in addition to changes 
in recharge and discharge. A global analysis of the effects of climate 
change on irrigation demand suggests that two thirds of the irri -
gated area in 1995 will be subjected to increased water requirements 
for irrigation by 2070 (ref.  54). Projected increases in irrigation 
demand in southern Europe will serve to stress limited groundwater 
resources further55. Persistent droughts projected in the California 
Central Valley over the latter half of the twenty-first century may 
trigger a shift from a predominantly surface-water to a predomi -
nantly groundwater supply for agriculture56. Increased groundwater 
abstraction combined with reduced surface-water flows associated 
with intermittent droughts during the first half of the twenty-first 
century may, however, induce secondary effects (for example, land 
subsidence) that severely constrain this future adaptation strategy.
Projections of the direct impacts of climate change on ground -
water systems are highly uncertain. The dominant source of 
uncertainty lies in climate projections derived from GCMs, which typically translate the same emissions scenarios into very different 
climate scenarios, particularly for precipitation51. Nevertheless, 
GCM projections of global precipitation for the twenty-first cen -
tury broadly indicate a ‘rich get richer’ pattern in which regions of 
moisture convergence (or divergence) are expected to experience 
increased (or decreased) precipitation52,57. There are no published 
studies applying a large ensemble of GCMs and greenhouse-gas 
emissions scenarios to generate recharge projections at the global 
scale. Global simulations using output from two climate models 
(ECHAM4, HadCM3) under two emissions scenarios (A2, B2) 
project: (1) decreases in potential groundwater recharge of more 
than 70% by the 2050s in northeast Brazil, southwest Africa and 
along the southern rim of the Mediterranean Sea; and (2) increases 
in potential recharge of more than 30% in the Sahel, Middle East, 
northern China, Siberia and the western United States17. Baseline 
recharge rates in many of these areas are, however, very low, so that 
small changes in projected recharge can result in large percentage 
changes. For most of the areas with high population densities and 
high sensitivity to groundwater recharge reductions, model results 
indicated that groundwater recharge is unlikely to decrease by more 
than 10% until the 2050s19.
Groundwater recharge projections are closely related to pro -
jected changes in precipitation. Regional simulations using 16 
GCMs in Australia project potential recharge decreases in the west, 
central and south, and increases in the north based on the ensemble 
median57. In Europe, potential recharge projections derived from an 
ensemble of four GCMs demonstrate strong latitudinal dependence 
on the direction of the climate change signal58. Substantial reduc -
tions in potential groundwater recharge are projected in southern 
Europe (Spain and northern Italy) whereas increases are consist -
ently projected in northern Europe (Denmark, southern England, 
northern France). Current uncertainty about the impacts of climate 
on recharge derive not only from the substantial uncertainty in 
GCM projections of precipitation but also from that associated with 
the downscaling of GCM projections and the hydrological models 
used59. For a chalk aquifer in England, for example, application of 
an ensemble of 13 GCMs resulted in projected changes in ground -
water recharge for the 2080s of between −26% and +31% (ref. 60).

range from −10% to +23% relative to historical recharge61. At three 
Australian sites, the choice of GCMs was found to be the great -
est source of uncertainty in future recharge projections, followed 
by that of downscaling and then the applied hydrological model, 
amounting to 53, 44 and 24% of historical recharge, respectively62. 
Uncertainty from downscaling can be greater than uncertainty due 
to the choice of applied emissions scenarios63,64.
Current projections of groundwater recharge under climate 
change commonly do not consider the intensification of precipita -
tion and physiological forcing of carbon dioxide (CO2). Although 
precipitation intensity is of critical importance to recharge, his -
torical daily rainfall distributions are typically used to downscale 
monthly rainfall projections to a daily timestep. Evidence from 
the tropics65, where the intensification of precipitation is expected 
to be especially strong, reveals that failure to consider changes in 
daily rainfall distributions can systemically underestimate future 
recharge. Transformation of the rainfall distribution to account for 
changes in rainfall intensity reversed a projected 55% decline in 
potential recharge to a 53% increase. Recent multi-model simu -
lations that account for precipitation intensification66 represent a 
critical advance in assessing climate change impacts on groundwa -
ter recharge and terrestrial water balances. Under higher atmos -
pheric CO2 concentrations, terrestrial plants open their stomata 
less; this response is projected to reduce evapotranspiration and 
increase continental runoff67. Recent analyses in Australia68 show 
that: (1) greater plant growth (and consequently greater leaf area) 
can offset reductions in evapotranspiration through stomatal 
closure; (2) reduced leaf area due to unfavourable climate condi -
tions can result in an increase of groundwater recharge even with 
slightly decreased rainfall; and (3) changes in rainfall intensity can 
have a greater impact on recharge fluxes than rising atmospheric 
CO2 concentrations.
Groundwater impacts on the climate system
Ground water influences climate through contributions to soil 
moisture and global sea-level rise (SLR). Recent effors to describe 
and quantify these effects are described below.
Groundwater-fed irrigation and soil moisture.  Irrigation 
can transform areas from moisture-limited to energy-limited evapotranspiration, thereby influencing water and energy budgets. 
A modelling study69 estimated that during the growing season, 
averaged over the continental United States, irrigation increases 
evapotranspiration by 4%. Simulations show that rising ground -
water-fed irrigation in the High Plains (Fig. 1) over the twentieth 
century increased downwind precipitation by ≤15% to 30% in the 
month of July70, with associated increases in groundwater storage 
and streamflow observed from August to September71. Irrigation 
in California’s Central Valley has strengthened the southwestern 
US monsoon, increasing precipitation by 15% and discharge of the 
Colorado River by 30% (ref. 72). Similar impacts of groundwater-
fed irrigation on evapotranspiration and downwind precipitation 
have been demonstrated in the Indian monsoon region using a 
regional climate model73.
Ground water in land-surface models . Land-surface models 
(LSMs), embedded in GCMs, have neglected hydrological pro -
cesses below the root zone such as lateral groundwater flow, as 
these have been assumed to be disconnected from the atmosphere. 
LSMs were subsequently retrofitted with a simplified formulation 
of unconfined groundwater storage changes74. There have also 
been attempts to represent subsurface processes better in LSMs75 
or to couple more complete groundwater models to LSMs76. 
These efforts led to the discovery of a critical zone of water-table 
depths from 2 to 7 m, where groundwater exerts the most influ -
ence on land-energy fluxes77. Coupling of an integrated hydro -
logical model to mesoscale atmospheric models78 revealed clear 
connections between water-table depth and development of the 
atmospheric boundary layer79. Representing groundwater flow in 
atmospheric models at larger scales and longer time frames affects 
land-surface moisture states that feed back into regional climate 
where water tables are relatively shallow80. Without a prognostic 
groundwater reservoir and explicit groundwater–surface-water 
exchanges in LSMs, we remain unable to represent the integrated 
response of the water cycle to human perturbations and climate 
change. One key groundwater process missing from LSMs is lat -
eral groundwater flow. This flow occurs at multiple spatial scales81 
but is fundamentally important at hill-slope (or small model grid) 
scales in a humid climate or at basin scales in semi-arid and arid 
climates with regional aquifers where discharges can be remote 
from sources of recharge82. Lateral groundwater flow supports per -
sistently wetter river valleys in humid climates, and regional wet -
lands and oases in arid climates80, affecting land-surface moisture 
states and evapotranspiration fluxes. Ground water also acts as an 
important store and vehicle for carbon, although studies account -
ing for groundwater interactions and feedbacks in the global car -
bon budget are still in their infancy83.
Groundwater and sea-level rise.  Coastal aquifers form the inter -
face between the oceanic and terrestrial hydrological systems and 
provide a source of water for the more than one billion people liv -
ing in coastal regions84. Global SLR of  1.8 mm yr−1 over the second 
half of the twentieth century85 is expected to have induced fresh–
saline-water interfaces to move inland. The extent of seawater intru -
sion into coastal aquifers depends on a variety of factors including 
coastal topography, recharge, and groundwater abstraction from 
coastal aquifers86,87. Analytical models suggest that the impact of 
SLR on seawater intrusion is negligible compared to that of ground -
water abstraction87. The effects of seawater intrusion have been 
observed most prominently in association with intensive ground -
water abstraction around areas with high population densities (for 
example, Bangkok, Jakarta, Gaza)88,89. Coastal aquifers under very 
low hydraulic gradients, such as the Asian mega-deltas, are theo -
retically sensitive to SLR but, in practice, are expected in coming 
decades to be more severely affected by saltwater inundation from 
storm surges than SLR87.

areas with substantial irrigation by surface water. Rates are estimated 
from the difference between the return flow of irrigation water to ground 
water and total groundwater withdrawals for the period 1998 to 20022. 
Note that in areas with predominantly groundwater-fed irrigation or 
significant water withdrawals for domestic and industrial purposes, no 
anthropogenic groundwater recharge occurs; a net abstraction of ground 
water leads to groundwater depletion in regions with insufficient natural 
groundwater recharge.REVIEW ARTICLE NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE  DOI: 10.1038/NCLIMATE1744

of fresh water from long-term terrestrial groundwater storage to 
active circulation near the earth’s surface and its eventual transfer 
to oceanic stores. The contribution of groundwater depletion to SLR 
has, however, been a subject of debate. In the IPCC fourth assess -
ment report90, the contribution of non-frozen terrestrial waters, 
including groundwater depletion, to sea-level variation was not 
specified owing to its perceived uncertainty. Recently, there has 
been a series of studies estimating the contribution of groundwa -
ter depletion to SLR18,91–93. Current estimates of global groundwater 
depletion derived from flux-based (year 2000) and volume-based 
(period, 2001–2008) methods are summarized in Table  1. Global 
groundwater depletion (204 ± 30 km3 yr−1) estimated by the flux-
based method91 derives from the difference between grid-based 
simulated groundwater recharge and net abstraction (that is 
groundwater withdrawals minus return flows). This approach over -
estimates depletion as it does not account for increased capture due 
to decreased groundwater discharge and long-distance surface-
water transfers. The volume-based method92 combines evidence 
of groundwater storage changes for the United States and another 
five aquifer systems (Indo-Gangetic plain, North China plain, Saudi 
Arabia, Nubian sandstone and North West Sahara) (Fig. 1), and then 
extrapolates groundwater depletion elsewhere using the average 
ratio of depletion to abstraction observed in the United States. This 
approach produces a lower global estimate of groundwater deple -
tion (145 ± 39 km3 yr−1) than the flux-based approach. Both meth -
ods reveal that groundwater depletion is most pronounced in Asia 
(China, India) and North America (Table 1). The different estimates 
of global groundwater depletion produce variable estimates of its 
current contribution to SLR (34% or 0.57 ± 0.09 mm yr−1 versus 23% 
or 0.4 ± 0.1 mm yr−1). Direct observations of groundwater depletion 
continue to be hampered by a dearth of ground-based observations, 
which not only limits our understanding of localized groundwa -
ter storage changes but also our ability to constrain evidence from 
GRACE satellite observations at larger scales (≥150,000 km2).
A look forward
Ground water can enhance the resilience of domestic, agricultural 
and industrial uses of fresh water in the face of climate variability 
and change. As the only perennial source of fresh water in many 
regions, ground water is of vital importance to the water security 
of many communities, including — most critically — rural dwell -
ers in low-income countries. Groundwater-fed irrigation provides 
a buffer against climate extremes and is consequently essential 
to global food security. Furthermore, it alleviates poverty in low-
income countries by reducing crop failure and increasing yields94. 
The value of ground water is expected to increase in coming decades 
as temporal variabilities in precipitation, soil moisture and surface 
water are projected to increase under more frequent and intense cli -
mate extremes associated with climate change53. Indeed, in light of the resilience of groundwater resources to hydrological extremes, 
ground water could have a strategic role in sustaining drinking-
water supplies under emergency conditions95.
As detailed earlier, substantial doubt remains about the projected 
impacts of climate change on diffuse groundwater recharge, which 
is associated with the inherent uncertainties in climate projections96 
and terrestrial responses to changing precipitation and land cover.  
More certain are rises in groundwater abstraction in absolute terms 
and as a proportion of total water withdrawals, which threaten to 
overexploit groundwater resources. This risk is particularly acute in 
semi-arid regions where projected increases in the frequency and 
intensity of droughts, combined with rising populations and stand -
ards of living as well as the projected expansion of irrigated land, 
will intensify groundwater demand. To sustain groundwater use 
under these conditions will require careful aquifer management97 
that: (1) is informed by integrated models able to consider the range 
of interactions between ground water, climate and human activity 
(summarized in Fig. 2); and (2) exploits opportunities for enhanced 
groundwater recharge associated with less frequent but heavier 
rainfall events and changing meltwater regimes. 
Comprehensive management approaches to water resources 
that integrate ground water and surface water may greatly reduce 
human vulnerability to climate extremes and change, and promote 
global water and food security. Conjunctive uses of ground water 
and surface water that use surface water for irrigation and water 
supply during wet periods, and ground water during drought48, 
are likely to prove essential. Recognition of current uncertainty 
in water resource projections and the longer residence time (dec -
adal to multigenerational) of fresh water in groundwater systems 
will be critical in setting sustainability goals97. Managed aqui -
fer recharge wherein excess surface water, desalinated water and 
treated waste water are stored in depleted aquifers could also sup -
plement groundwater storage for use during droughts43,98. Indeed, 
the use of aquifers as natural storage reservoirs avoids many of the 
problems of evaporative losses and ecosystem impacts associated 
with large, constructed surface-water reservoirs. In South Asia, for 
example, intensive groundwater abstraction for dry-season irriga -
tion has induced greater recharge in areas with permeable soils by 
increasing available groundwater storage during the subsequent 
monsoon99. In northern Europe, capture of projected increases in 
groundwater recharge during winter may help to sustain anticipated 
increases in summer demand58. Explicit representation in GCMs of 
groundwater storage, its interactions with surface-water stores, and 
anthropogenic perturbations  — such as large-scale groundwater-
fed irrigation — is required to advance our understanding of both 
the influence of ground water on climate and the impact of climate 
change on global freshwater resources.
A fundamental impediment to using the adaptation strategies 
discussed earlier is the lack of groundwater observations to inform 
them. Since 2002, GRACE satellite observations have provided T able  1 | Estimates of global- and continental-scale groundwater depletion.

basin scales, but ground-based data are essential to constrain sat -
ellite observations and to inform local groundwater responses to 
climate and abstraction. The Global Groundwater Monitoring 
Network (GGMN), initiated in 2007 by the UNESCO International 
Hydrological Programme (IHP) International Groundwater 
Resources Assessment Centre to facilitate the sharing of groundwa -
ter information globally, has begun collating data sets from publicly 
accessible sources and via participatory processes. The first global 
maps of groundwater resources were compiled in 2004 (ref.  9), 
and ground water has recently been incorporated into the Global 
Earth Observation System of Systems. Nevertheless, the availabil -
ity of groundwater data (for example, groundwater levels and with -
drawals) remains limited. As a result, our ability to evaluate fully 
the responses of ground water to climate variability and change, 
to estimate directly groundwater replenishment, and to constrain 
models and satellite observations, is severely impaired. There is, for 
example, a profound lack of knowledge regarding the quantity of 
groundwater storage in most aquifers that may be sustainably used. 
The equivalent depth of groundwater storage, determined primarily 
by geology, can vary substantially from regional sedimentary aqui -
fers (>50 m) to small, discontinuous aquifers in deeply weathered 
crystalline rock (<1 m) that lie under 40% of sub-Saharan Africa100. 
An expansion of groundwater monitoring, together with increased 
contributions of data to the GGMN, are necessary to improve access 
to groundwater data globally and promote the inclusion of ground 
water in the assessment and management of freshwater resources 
under climate change.

Abstract
Our limited understanding of the climate controls on tropical forest seasonality is one of
the biggest sources of uncertainty in modeling climate change impacts on terrestrial
ecosystems. Combining leaf production, litterfall and climate observations from satellite
and ground data in the Amazon forest, we show that seasonal variation in leaf
production is largely triggered by climate signals, specifically, insolation increase (70.4%
of the total area) and precipitation increase (29.6%). Increase of insolation drives leaf
growth in the absence of water limitation. For these non-water-limited forests, the
simultaneous leaf flush occurs in a sufficient proportion of the trees to be observed from
space. While tropical cycles are generally defined in terms of dry or wet season, we show
that for a large part of Amazonia the increase in insolation triggers the visible progress
of leaf growth, just like during spring in temperate forests. The dependence of leaf
growth initiation on climate seasonality may result in a higher sensitivity of these
ecosystems to changes in climate than previously thought.
Introduction 1
The Amazonian forests account for 14% of the global net primary production (NPP) 2
and are a major component (66%) of the inter-annual variation in global NPP [1]. 3
While large seasonal swings in leaf area have been reported at least in parts of the 4
Amazon basin [2{4], the environmental controls that trigger the synchronous 5
development of new leaves are not well understood [5{7]. As a result, current earth 6
system models inadequately represent the dynamics of leaf development, despite its 7
PLOS 1/19major role for photosynthesis of tropical vegetation [8]. In equatorial forests, leaf 8
flushing correlates with increased light availability and photosynthetically active 9
radiation during the dry season [4,9], and is theoretically driven by a change in daily 10
insolation [10]. However, water availability constrains leaf phenology in southern 11
Amazonia and most of the Congo basin, impeding the maintenance of the evergreen 12
state during the dry season [11]. The climate thresholds controlling the phenological 13
responses of vegetation remain unclear [12], as well as the sensitivities of these responses 14
to future climate changes [13]. 15
The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), from the Moderate Resolution Imaging 16
Spectroradiometer (MODIS), improves the sensitivity of the vegetation signal in high 17
biomass regions and it strongly correlates with chlorophyll content and photosynthetic 18
activity [5,14]. An unexpected result from this index was the Amazon forest ""greening"" 19
in the dry season [5]. The evidence provided by the MODIS sensor raised a debate not 20
on the fact of the dry-season greening of the forest, but on deciphering if this greening is 21
more intense during drought years or not [6,15]. Later, it has been suggested that the 22
observed greening during the dry season in the Amazon could be attributed to artefact 23
of sun-sensor geometry [16,17]. However, a new version of EVI supports the dry season 24
greening in the Amazon [4,18]. This EVI is corrected for the sun-sensor artefact from 25
the multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction algorithm (MAIAC) [19]. 26
Furthermore, a recent analysis of seasonal canopy leaf area index (LAI) changes 27
estimated from independent lidar-based satellite observations over the Amazon forest 28
fully supports the existence of the greening [20]. 29
While the biophysical interpretation of EVI increase remains to be fully assessed [21], 30
recent accumulation of evidences in the Amazon converge to a positive correlation of 31
EVI increase and leaf flushing. This have been observed with different types of field 32
data such as percentage of trees with new leaves [18,22,23], green crown fraction 33
measured above the canopy with camera [8], indirect estimation of leaf flush with 34
litterfall [24,25], leaf spectral reflectance measurements [26] and remote-sensed changes 35
of lidar-derived canopy leaf area index (LAI) [20]. 36
The observations of leaf-flushing during the dry season challenge our vision of 37
droughts in tropical forests. The droughts may have negative impact on the forest 38
structure and dynamics [27], such as increase in mortality [28,29] or reduction of tree 39
radial growth [25]. Furthermore, tropical trees show at some extent adaptation to 40
drought with leaf water potential at wilting point ranging from -1.4 to -3.2 MPa [30]. 41
But, in case of water stress, a common behavior of the trees is to shed the leaves, as 42
observed in dry tropical forest [31]. This indicates that leaf-flushing in the heart of the 43
dry season necessarily implies a sufficient supply of water. Above 2000 mm of annual 44
precipitation, global tropical forests maintain evergreen state and present the increase of 45
the photosynthetic capacity | the greening | during the driest season [11]. These 46
forests, whose canopies' processes are observed using remote sensing, are not limited by 47
water; they satisfy their water demands during the dry season using the supply of 48
redistributed subsurface water of the wet season [11]. Despite the leaf phenology of 49
Amazonian forests appears driven by sun-related variables and shows greening during 50
dry seasons, an analysis of the potential drivers in a continuous spatial framework is 51
still missing [4,5,9,20]. 52
To investigate the Amazon seasonality, we model the period of increase in leaf 53
production, proxied by the main period of increasing remotely sensed Enhanced 54
Vegetation Index (EVI) [14,32], with the seasonal increase of the potential climate 55
drivers, i.e.precipitation and insolation (proxied by maximal temperature, S1 Fig). We 56
assume that EVI ""greening"" relates to seasonal flush of new leaves based on recent 57
evidences obtained in Amazonia [8,20,22,23,26]. EVI values were computed from the 58
multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction algorithm (MAIAC) [19]. We 59
PLOS 2/19used EVI normalized to a nadir view angle and 45sun zenith angle to avoid artifacts 60
from changing sun-sensor geometry over time. 61
Materials and Methods 62
Satellite greenness from MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index 63
(MAIAC EVI) 64
We used enhanced vegetation index (EVI) imagery obtained by the Moderate 65
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, on board the Terra and Aqua 66
satellites (EOS AM, NASA) [33]. Data were processed with multiangle implementation 67
of atmospheric correction algorithm (MAIAC) [19]. Data were obtained for 12 MODIS 68
tiles (h10v08 to h13v10, spanning 10N to 20S in latitude and 80W to 40W in 69
longitude) from NASA's Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System 70
(LAADS Web: ftp://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/MAIAC). MAIAC observations are based 71
on MODIS Collection 6 Level 1B (calibrated and geometrically corrected) observations, 72
which removed major sensor calibration degradation effects present in earlier collections. 73
We used observations from the Terra and Aqua satellites collected between 2000 and 74
2012 at 1-km spatial resolution. EVI data were corrected for bidirectional reflectance 75
effects by normalizing all observations to a fixed sun sensor geometry (solar zenith angle 76
of 45and nadir view angle) [19]. Advanced cloud detection and aerosol-surface 77
retrieval in MAIAC improves the accuracy of satellite-based surface reflectances over 78
tropical vegetation 3 to 10 fold compared with the standard MODIS products [34]. 79
Climate measurements 80
Precipitation measurements were obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring 81
Mission (TRMM) 3B43V7 product, which provides monthly precipitation estimates at 82
0.25spatial resolution, for the tropical and subtropical regions. We analyzed data from 83
2000 to 2013. Maximal temperature ( tmx,C) was obtained from monthly climate 84
global dataset (CRU-TS3.21) available at 0.5spatial resolution, from 1901{2012, 85
produced by the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia [35]. 86
Additionally, we used monthly incoming solar radiation at the surface ( rad, W.m 2) 87
covering the period 2000{2012 at 0.5spatial resolution, estimated by the Clouds and 88
the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments onboard the NASA Terra 89
and Aqua satellite [36]. In preliminary analysis, we compared maximal temperature 90
from CRU and incoming radiation at the surface from CERES data. Maximal 91
temperature from CRU was highly correlated with incoming radiation at the surface 92
from CERES (Pearson's r = 0.76, p-value <0.0001, Figure S1 Fig). Here, we used 93
maximal temperature rather than incoming radiation because it has previously been 94
shown to be a good predictor of EVI seasonality in tropical forests [25]. 95
Vegetation land mask and altitude datasets 96
EVI pixels covering areas with tree cover below 80% were excluded from the analysis. 97
Forest masking was done using the Global forest cover loss 2000{2014 data set based on 98
Landsat data at 30 m spatial resolution [37]. We used the vegetation map for Brazil [38] 99
to analyze if the seasonal patterns of EVI were related to vegetation type. Additionally, 100
to test the effect of the altitude on the quality of our EVI model, we used altitude from 101
the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (USGS/NASA SRTM data), resampled to 250 m 102
spatial resolution for the entire globe (CGIAR-CSI, version 4.1) and filled to provide 103
seamless continuous topography surfaces [39]. 104
PLOS 3/19Field measurements of litterfall productivity 105
Seasonal litterfall productivity measurements from two previously published studies 106
were used to estimate leaf-fall productivity [25,40] (table 1). It has been previously 107
demonstrated that the seasonal pattern of total litterfall (leaves, fruits, flowers and 108
twigs) in this dataset is not different from seasonal pattern of leaf-fall alone (Pearson 109
test, t = 42.7597, df = 218, p-value <0.001) [25]. Furthermore, no relation between 110
seasonal litterfall and soil types has been observed in this dataset [40]. Here, we used 111
only data with monthly measurements from old-growth forests, as some sites have plots 112
of both secondary and old-growth forests and flooded forests were excluded. Only the 113
sites where the model of EVI increase had a R2above 0.8 were selected. While these 114
measurements are from the largest litterfall database ever produced for South America, 115
some of the measurements have been made before the MODIS era. 116
Data preparation 117
The spatial resolution of all data sets, including climate variables, tree cover, land mask 118
and altitude, were resampled to 1 km, to match the resolution of MAIAC EVI. 119
Inter-annual monthly mean values of EVI were filtered using the Fourier Transform 120
(FT) to keep only the annual and bis-annual frequencies that compose the EVI signal 121
(S1 Appendix). Maximal temperature and precipitation inter-annual monthly mean 122
values were computed by pixel. For the analysis, we computed normalized EVI MAIAC 123
(FT filtered), maximal temperature and precipitation by subtracting the mean and 124
dividing by the standard deviation. 125
Models 126
Individual pixel EVI model 127
For a pixel i,i= 1;:::;n , normalized EVI ( EVIn ) was modeled using normalized 128
precipitation ( pre) and normalized maximal temperature ( tmx) as : 129
EVIn i;t=i
0+i
1prei;t+i
2tmxi;t lag+""i;t (1)
wherei
10,i
20,""i;tN(0;2=!i;t) andt= 1;:::;n is a given month. Here, we 130
assume that EVI increase is a proxy for the production of new leaves [8,23,26]. To focus 131
our evaluation on the effects of leaf flushing rather than leaf aging, we limited the 132
subsequent analysis to the increasing part of EVI, rather than the decreasing one, which 133
is generally related to leaf aging (changes in morphological and biochemical leaf traits) 134
and parasites [26,32]. To account for this, the coefficients of the model i
1andi
2were 135
set to have non-negative values. To give more importance to the fitting of the main 136
increasing EVI period, we add an arbitrary weight, i.e. !i;t= 10 during a month tof 137
the ""main increase"" and !i;t= 1 otherwise. The ""main increase"" was define as the 138
longer period between a pit and a peak in the EVI time series (S1 Appendix). Finally, 139
we minimized the weighted sum of squares of the model. This enables us to use all 140
months to fit the model, including the EVI decreasing months, which resulted in a 141
better model fit. 142

For each pixel i, the coefficient of determination R2
iwas computed with the weights 143
!t=1:12 ;i, that is, the residual sum of squares ( SSei, eqn 3) and the total sum of squares 144
(SSti, eqn 4) were weighted. EVIn is the observed normalized EVI and \EVIn its 145
prediction from the linear model. 146
The determination of the time lag between the increase of maximal temperature and 147
EVI increase was made in two steps. First, we estimated the best EVI model for the 148
whole area with a lag of 0, 1, 2 and 3 months. Second, we estimated the best model of 149
EVI increase with the increase of maximal temperature at lag 0, 1, 2 and 3 months by 150
pixels, by using only the pixels where precipitation and maximal temperature are 151
correlated below 0.2 during the increase of EVI at all the lags. This selection discards 152
artificial correlations between the climate variables. Then, we compared the results by 153
pixels of the best model selected at the first step for the whole area (one month) and 154
the lags obtained at the second step using the Bayesian information criterion [49]. 155
Finally, we kept the best model for each pixel. 156
Monthly leaf fall estimation (from monthly litterfall productivity measurements) 157
were normalized and smoothed using a spline with 4 degrees of freedom and compared 158
to the normalized EVI ( EVIn ). 159
Finally, the quality of the fit of the EVI model was analyzed by comparing it against 160
the mean annual precipitation, the mean annual maximal temperature and standard 161
deviation, the mean percentage of valid observations per month in MAIAC data, the 162
periodicity of the EVI signal, the altitude and the tree cover. 163
All analyses were performed using R [50] 164
Results 165
EVI greening across the Amazon forest can be explained by seasonal increase in 166
insolation and precipitation (Fig. 1 and S8 Fig). Seasonal changes in EVI were mainly 167
related to insolation (70.4% of the total area) in the north-western, central and eastern 168
part of Amazonia. EVI greening is associated to precipitation seasonality (29.6% of the 169
area) in continuous areas above 5N (North part) and below 5S (South-West, South 170
and South East part). 75.0% of the pixels where the greening is associated to insolation 171
follows the increase in solar radiation with a mean lag of one month (S7 Fig). No time 172
lag was observed in regions where greening is associated to an increase in precipitation. 173
The modeled EVI with precipitation and maximal temperature is consistent with 174
MAIAC EVI (S8 Fig). Inconsistent regions (R2<0.5, 6.2% of the forested area) have 175
either uncommon forest structures, such as bamboo dominated forests, or constant 176
cloud cover inducing high noise in the EVI signal (S3 Appendix, S10 Fig) 177
The seasonal association of MAIAC EVI and litterfall (measured across 16 sites 178
within the Amazon basin, table 1), changes depending on the climate variable 179
associated with EVI (Fig. 2). In the sites where EVI is associated to precipitation, EVI 180
has an negative linear relation with litterfall (site 1-5, Fig. 2). In these sites, the 181

in South American tropical forests.
Locations of the sites with monthly litterfall productivity measurements are indicated
by blue numbers.
PLOS 7/19browning of the vegetation occurs when leaf shedding is maximum. For most of the sites 182
where EVI is associated to radiation a singular temporal pattern is observed. The 183
highest production of litterfall occurs, not when EVI is maximum, but when EVI 184
increase (site 6-16, Fig. 2). All these sites present a peak of litterfall even if some of 185
them produce litterfall in all the months of the year. 186
Discussion 187
Despite the high diversity and different species composition of these forests, we show 188
that EVI greening across the Amazon forest may be explained by climate seasonality 189
(Fig. 1). The predicted EVI from precipitation and insolation is highly consistent with 190
the observed MAIAC EVI (S8 Fig), supporting the model's biological assumptions: EVI 191
increase is likely a proxy of leaf production triggered by climate drivers. Isolated 192
patches where the results are not consistent (R2<0.5, 6.2% of the forested area) 193
represent areas highly challenging for remote sensing; that is, uncommon forest 194
structures, such as bamboo dominated forests, constant cloud cover resulting in high 195
noise in EVI (S3 Appendix and S10 Fig); and may be micro-climate or local soil water 196
retention characteristics. Comparing our modeled EVI to MAIAC EVI reveals 197
limitations of the remotely sensed EVI that cannot be discovered with classic remote 198
sensing analysis (such as classifications) which does not consider the biophysical nature 199
of the signal. Additionally, it gives a biological interpretation of EVI derived from 200
optical measurements of reflected electromagnetic radiation. 201
It was previously shown that the difference of mean wet and dry season EVI 202
(EVI (wet dry)) is associated to water availability for the canopy processes in tropical 203
forests, globally [11]. The authors found that  EVI (wet dry)is positive in forests with 204
precipitation <2000 mm.yr 1, while negative in region with no water limitations. Our 205
results agree with this study. In water-limited regions, where precipitation is the main 206
control of EVI seasonality, the lowest EVI is observed during the driest period. 207
Additionally, here we show that for forests without water limitations (highest EVI 208
during the dry periods), seasonal radiation increase is likely the climate control of EVI 209
greening, as already observed for several sites in tropical forests [4,5,25,51]. These 210
results refute the general intuition found in the literature regarding the negative effect 211
of dry seasons or seasonal droughts on tropical forest dynamics [27]; for example, 212
seasonal or temporary droughts are known to increase the mortality of trees [28,29] and 213
to reduce tree growth [25]. However, we show that the dry season consequences on the 214
canopy functioning is not always stress. This is confirmed by dry season observations of 215
leaf flushing [8,20,22,23,31,52,53]; and photosynthesis increase from flux towers [9,54] 216
and satellite remote sensing [4,5,11,18,51]. This indicates that during the dry season, 217
these forests might not be limited by water . From ours and previous results based on 218
EVI [11], we further referred to water-limited and light-limited for the forest where EVI 219
seasonality is associated to water or radiation, respectively. 220
In light-limited forests, EVI peaked during the period of increasing insolation, likely 221
as a result of increased new leaf production [3,5{7,11,22,23,51]. While not all the 222
species have annual leaves production cycle, field observations of proportion of trees 223
with news leaves in light-limited forest support this result [8,18,22]. Here, the greening 224
follows the increase in solar radiation with a mean time lag of one month (75.0% of the 225
light limited pixels, S7 Fig); which is consistent with dry season field and satellites 226
observations of leaf flushing, which occurred several weeks after increase in insolation in 227
tropical forests [9,23,51,55,56]. The bud break preceding synchronous greening of 228
tropical forests are caused by an environmental signal perceived weeks before leaf 229
emergence and this has been ignored by previous remote sensing studies [10,57]. The 230
time lag observed here may have three explanations. First, it could be caused by the 231

Model fit Radiation100 %
0 % 100 %Fig 2. Seasonal leaf production (EVI increase) and associated litterfall
productivity in 16 tropical forest sites.
PLOS 9/19sensitivity of trees to seasonal changes in climate. A gradual increase in insolation 232
might be a climate signal more subtle to perceive than the rapid transition from dry to 233
wet season, and could explain why leaf flush is not synchronized with the increase of 234
insolation. Second, in the absence of a strong signal during the dry season, the observed 235
time lag may also be related to the production of bud and subsequent bud break if the 236
buds have not been produced on the trees during the rainy season and need time to 237
develop following the increase of insolation. Third, the time lag could reflect 238
yet-unknown endogenous driver of leaf production. For instance, we know that 239
individuals of the same species can present differences in the timing of leaf flush [53] 240
and that leaf renewal and/or net leaf abscission also occur during the entire year 241
unrelated to climate variations [3,4,10,25,51]. The 1km spatial resolution of EVI 242
MAIAC integrates the changes in the canopy of all the trees in this area. While it exists 243
a variability between species and individuals, remarkably, the change of the canopy 244
properties visible from space seems to indicate that in light-limited forests an important 245
proportion of the trees flush their leaves during the dry season. The time lag may thus 246
be pragmatically viewed as the mean response time between insolation increase and the 247
flushing of new leaves. 248
In water-limited regions, greening is associated with an increase in precipitation. 249
This is consistent with observations in dry tropical forests, where the timing of 250
synchronous bud break of leafless trees varied from year to year with the first rains of 251
the wet season, as irrigation caused bud break within a few days [58]. This also suggests 252
that the leaf buds are already set up but stay dormant during the dry season. The 253
relationship between seasonal changes in MAIAC EVI and litterfall (Fig. 2) confirms 254
two major assumptions about leaf fall seasonality in tropical forests. First, abscission 255
due to the seasonal production of new leaves in response to increased light availability 256
when water is not limited, and second, leaf shedding due to high evaporative demand in 257
water limited environments [3,8,25,40,51,59,60]. 258
In water-limited forests where the seasonal leaf fall responds to high evaporative 259
demand [25], the leaf fall peaks when minimum EVI values are observed. The linear 260
relation between EVI and leaf fall suggests that the EVI seasonality of these regions is 261
mainly explained by the net loss or gain of leaves (Fig. 2). In light-limited forests, 262
minimum EVI was mostly not synchronized with maximum litterfall (Fig. 2). This 263
supports previous results showing that EVI browning is more likely related to leaf aging 264
and parasites in these regions [26,32,61]. While in light-limited forests, leaf fall 265
seasonality could be mainly explained by the coordination in time of leaf growth with 266
senescence [8,20,23], in water-limited forests, leaf fall is not synchronous with leaf 267
production (Fig. 2). Leaf demography models [8] should account for this difference in 268
order to be representative of the whole Amazon. More studies of leaf renewal based on 269
field and remote remote sensing data [8,20,23] are needed to confirm the direct link 270
between increase EVI and new leaves production. 271
Conclusion 272
Subtropical and tropical seasons are generally defined in terms of dry or wet season, but 273
here we show that this definition is not correct in the Amazonian forest regions without 274
water constraints. In 70.4% of the Amazon forest, the increase in insolation triggers the 275
visible progress of leaf growth and this process occurs in a sufficient proportion of the 276
trees to be observed from satellites, just like during spring in temperate forests [62]. 277
Direct and strong climate environmental signals trigger leaf growing season, which 278
supports the hypothesis of a leaf production optimized for carbon gain under seasonal 279
resource availability [56,58,60]. In absence of water limitation, the leaf production 280
follows the solar insolation, while in water-limited regions, trees quickly produce leaves 281
PLOS 10/19with the first rains to benefit from high insolation at the end of the dry season. This 282
high dependency of seasonal leaf renewal on climate, previously largely 283
underestimated [63], may indicate a high sensitivity of these ecosystems to climate 284
change. 285

S1 Appendix. Finding the months of the main EVI increase. To filter the 347
EVI time series and find the main increase, we used a Fourier spectral decomposition. 348
EVI inter-annual monthly mean values were modelled by a weighted sum of simple sine 349
waves of period 6 months and 12 months, that is, one or two seasonal increases of EVI 350
per year, as observed in the EVI time series. We assumed that other periods in the 351
signal are only constituted by noise. To filter EVI, we fit the following equation to the 352
EVI time series : 353
[EVI (t) =EVI 0+pow 0 
p6sin(21
6t+6) +p12sin(21
12t+12)
(6)
withp6+p12= 1 and for t= 1;:::; 12n. 354
[EVI is the filtered time series, EVI 0is as an estimate of the mean annual EVI, t is 355
the time in month, 6and12are the delay of signal components with periods of 6 356
months and 12 months respectively. pow 0is the power of the signal and p6,p12are the 357
relative proportion of the periods of 6 months and 12 months respectively. The 358
parameters EVI 0,pow 0,p6,p12,6and12were estimated by least square 359
minimization. To facilitate the optimization, the time series was replicated 3 times 360
(n= 3). 361
After filtering the EVI signal, pits and peaks were identified in the [EVI time series. 362
A peak or pit is an observation that is preceded and followed by, respectively, lower or 363
higher observations [64,65]. The main increase was defined as the months during the 364
longest period between a pit and peak. 365
This analysis was also performed on precipitation and temperature time series to 366
determine the relative proportion of the 6 and 12 months periods in their time series. 367
PLOS 12/19S2 Appendix. Periodicity analysis of monthly EVI MAIAC, precipitation 368
and maximal temperature. From the analysis of frequency in the time series of EVI 369
and climate variables, we determined that 93.4% of the forested pixels have only one 370
seasonal increase in the EVI signal per year (fig. S2 Figa). Some forested pixels, 371
however, have two periods in the EVI signal and are spatially coherent. This could 372
reflect an influence of the vegetation structure on EVI. Some forested pixels have two 373
periods in the signal and are not clearly spatially aggregated, indicating large shifts in 374
the signal. This might reflect noise in the data resulting from low availability of good 375
quality observations for EVI computation. Regions where EVI signal shows more than 376
one period in a year (6.6% of the forested surface) were localized largely in the 377
Colombian Amazon, in the Brazilian States of Acre and Roraima, in the North-East 378
part of Guyana, in the central and Eastern part Venezuela (fig. S2 Figa). Pixels with 379
two periods in the EVI signal are not predictable if the number of periods in the climate 380
variables are not correlated or the same. In the case of both climate variables with two 381
periods (figs. S2 Figb-c) and EVI with only one period, our model won't fit the EVI 382
data as it will predict two periods. 383
S3 Appendix. EVI MAIAC regional pattern analysis. In the following, we 384
describe the EVI pattern for 3 regions (numbered in Fig. S3 Fig) where the model had 385
problems to reproduce the seasonal pattern of EVI. 386
Brazilian region of Acre, region 1. In Acre, spatial aggregates of pixels show 387
weak association to climate variables (R2<0.4, fig. S3 Fig region 1). The EVI signal in 388
this region was found to have two distinct patterns (fig. S4 Fig region 1), a peak in 389
November correlated with maximal temperature and a peak in June-July apparently 390
dissociated of climate. The pixels with R2above 0.9 have one period per year while the 391
pixels with R2below 0.1 have two periods per year (fig. S3 Fig region 1). The two 392
periods are also visible in the analysis of EVI frequencies (fig. S2 Figa). Bamboo 393
dominated forests are common in Acre and their occurrence have been mapped [38]. 394
The patches with low R2appear spatially related to the bamboo dominated forests (fig. 395
S5 Fig). These Bamboo dominated forests are characterized by a mosaic of forest stands 396
without bamboo with heterogeneous forest structure, and stands of trees scattered 397
within a canopy dominated by a single species of native arborescent bamboos ( Guadua 398
spp.) [66]. Our results show that MAIAC bidirectional reflectance distribution function 399
(BRDF) may not describe the BRDF of such complex canopy structure accurately 400
enough. Interestingly, the changes occurring in October and November indicate a good 401
sensibility of EVI MAIAC to capture EVI changes during wet months (mean 402
precipitation of 227.0 and 295.7 mm, respectively). 403
Brazilian region of Roraima, region 2. In Roraima (fig. S4 Fig region 2), 404
spatially aggregated pixels showed only weak correlation to climate variables. The 405
coefficient of determination (R2) declined from over to 0.9 to below 0.1, from side to 406
side of the hills (fig. S6 Figa). The areas with low R2values form plumes located on the 407
West South-West sides of these hills (fig. S6 Figd). The MAIAC number of observations 408
per month shows an increase from the top to the West and South-West side of these 409
mountains (fig. S6 Figb) in the direction of the prevailing wind of this region. The 410
highly significance of EVI increase in the areas with a R2above 0.9 is likely associated 411
with maximal temperature increase occurring one month before. For the areas with a 412
R2below 0.9, the general pattern of EVI is similar, however the increase occurs with a 413
time lag of two or three months after the increase of maximal temperature. For these 414
latter areas, the EVI increase was not correlated with precipitation, as EVI increase 415
primarily followed maximal temperature. We estimated the lag of EVI increase with the 416
increase of maximal temperature at 0, 1, 2 and 3 months. To discard artificial 417
correlations between the climate variables, the lags were estimated only for the pixels 418
PLOS 13/19where precipitation and maximal temperature are correlated below 0.2 during the 419
increase of EVI at all the lags. Then, we compared the results of the model at lag 1 and 420
the other lags using the Bayesian information criterion [49] and kept the best model (fig. 421
S7 Fig). For this region, the time lags of two and three months are located on the West 422
South-West sides of the mountains (fig. S6 Figc). The linear model of EVI with 423
precipitation, maximal temperature and the associated lags allowed us to reproduce the 424
pattern of EVI increase in Roraima (fig. S6 Fige). The lags are unlikely due to shade 425
artifacts or slope effects because a BRDF function corrects for these effects in the 426
MAIAC, and, if these artifacts were the causes, their effects should also occur in other 427
regions of Amazonia. This region shows an unique climate seasonality in our data set, 428
precipitation and maximal temperature are the most asynchronous and their peaks are 429
separated by more than 5 months. In the areas where a time lag of two to three months 430
was observed with respect to increase in solar radiation, trees may delay leaf flushing. 431
The number of MAIAC observations per month is higher in these areas (fig. S6 Figb) 432
meaning that they are less cloudy than the areas with a time lag of one month between 433
EVI and maximal temperature increase. In the EVI signal, the increase of EVI for these 434
area is less sharp (fig S4 Fig region 2). 435
Venezuela, Region 3. In Venezuela (fig. S3 Fig region 3 and fig. S4 Fig region 3), 436
the observed EVI signal was found to be noisier than in other regions presented in this 437
work. This region is amongst those with the lowest number of valid observations per 438
month, a mean and maximum of 34.6 % and 50.7% was observed. Increase in EVI in 439
associated to maximum temperature increase occurred from February and May and 440
from July to October. This region has a complex climate with two periods in maximal 441
temperature and precipitation per year. 442

Abstract
Climate change is projected to push the limits of cropping systems and has the potential to disrupt the agricultural
sector from local to global scales. This article introduces the Coordinated Climate-Crop Modeling Project (C3MP), an
initiative of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) to engage a global network
of crop modelers to explore the impacts of climate change via an investigation of crop responses to changes in carbondioxide concentration ([CO
2]), temperature, and water. As a demonstration of the C3MP protocols and enabled analy-
ses, we apply the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) CROPGRO-Peanut crop model for
Henry County, Alabama, to evaluate responses to the range of plausible [CO 2], temperature changes, and precipita-
tion changes projected by climate models out to the end of the 21st century. These sensitivity tests are used to derivecrop model emulators that estimate changes in mean yield and the coefﬁcient of variation for seasonal yields across a
broad range of climate conditions, reproducing mean yields from sensitivity test simulations with deviations of ca.
2% for rain-fed conditions. We apply these statistical emulators to investigate how peanuts respond to projectionsfrom various global climate models, time periods, and emissions scenarios, ﬁnding a robust projection of modest(<10%) median yield losses in the middle of the 21st century accelerating to more severe ( >20%) losses and larger
uncertainty at the end of the century under the more severe representative concentration pathway (RCP8.5). This pro-
jection is not substantially altered by the selection of the AgMERRA global gridded climate dataset rather than thelocal historical observations, differences between the Third and Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3and CMIP5), or the use of the delta method of climate impacts analysis rather than the C3MP impacts response sur-
face and emulator approach.

Introduction
Climate change is projected to impact agricultural sys-
tems most directly through changes in temperature, pre-
cipitation, and carbon dioxide concentration ([CO 2]),
with crop responses varying across farms depending onthe cultivar, management, soil, and baseline climate.Additional factors (including pests, diseases, weeds,extreme climate events, water resources, soil degrada-tion, agrotechnological development, and economicpressures) will also inﬂuence the fate of future agriculturalproduction and deserve scrutiny. There is much to be
learned in examining the response of agricultural sys-tems to the core carbon dioxide, temperature, and water
(CTW) changes, however (Hatﬁeld et al., 2011).
Crop models provide a biophysical process-based
tool to investigate crop responses in light of environ-
mental conditions and farm management, and have
been applied to climate impact assessment using a vari-ety of methods (see review by White et al., 2011). The
utility of these climate change applications is hindered,however, by the small (1 ha) scale of most process-
based crop models, the considerable effort required to
achieve satisfactory calibration at a given site, methodo-logical uncertainties, errors in historical climate datasets

of agreement among various crop models’ responses toCTW changes (R €otter et al., 2011). Most importantly, to
date there has not been a coordinated effort to performclimate impacts analyses with a large number of crops,crop models, and detailed crop modeling sites around
the world.
While the execution of a single site’s crop model is
relatively cheap, the coordination of agricultural
impacts assessments at larger scales require consistentand timely contributions from a large number of cropmodelers, and this effort cannot be duplicated eachtime a new global climate model (GCM), downscalingtechnique, or scenario result is created. In addition,evaluation of a subset of GCM simulations is not sufﬁ-cient to separate important interactions in crop model
response. A mechanism is therefore needed to rapidly
assess the climate impacts across a wide envelope ofclimate change space to enable an investigation ofuncertainties from any single-GCM or multi-GCM andmulti-RCM ensemble (Deser et al., 2012).
The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Imp-
rovement Project (AgMIP; Rosenzweig et al., 2013) was
created to substantially improve the climate, crop, and
economic simulation tools that are used to characterize
the agricultural sector, to assess future world food secu-rity under changing climate conditions, and to enhanceadaptation capacity in both developing and developedcountries. AgMIP has led detailed model intercompari-sons at highly observed ﬁeld sites for wheat (Assenget al., 2013), rice (Li et al., unplublished data), maize
(Bassu et al., unpublished data), and sugarcane (Singels
et al., 2013), ﬁnding largely consistent response patterns
across models. It is also clear that crop model selectioncan be an important factor in an assessment of climateimpacts for any given location due to the processes andmechanisms emphasized in the modeling approach.AgMIP is also employing global gridded crop models(GGCMs) to simulate global agricultural production(e.g., Rosenzweig et al., in press, compare 7 GGCMs on
a global ½degree grid) relying on large geodatasets of
soil and climate as well as biophysical algorithms todetermine likely grid cell inputs for management and
cultivars.
The following sections describe a new AgMIP initia-
tive that is coordinating detailed crop model simula-tions on a global network for climate change impactassessments. To demonstrate the utility of the simula-
tions that will be run at each site and establish a com-
mon methodology of evaluation, we present resultsfrom a prototype peanut modeling site in HenryCounty, Alabama, USA. Henry County is a majorproducer at the center of the Southeastern US peanutbelt, and quality soil, meteorology, and managementinformation allow for a robust simulation of yield
impacts in light of a changing climate. Results fromHenry County are used to discuss the potential beneﬁtsof this prototype approach being repeated across alarge number of locations, crop species, and crop mod-els to enable more comprehensive climate impactsanalysis.
Materials and methods
The Coordinated Climate-Crop Modeling Project (C3MP)
The Coordinated Climate-Crop Modeling Project (C3MP;
http://www.agmip.org/c3mp) was created as an AgMIP ini-
tiative to provide consistent information about crop yieldresponse to CTW changes across a large, distributed, and glo-bal network of established crop modeling sites to facilitate cli-
mate impacts assessments. The work builds on earlier efforts
at the site scale (R €ais€anen & Ruokalainen, 2006; Ferrise et al. ,
2011; Ruane et al., 2013) and at the regional scale (Howden &
Crimp, 2005; Crimp et al., 2008; Iizumi et al., 2010) that com-
bine crop model sensitivity tests with crop response emulators(statistical representations of models) across a wide uncer-
tainty space.
All C3MP participants follow a set of common protocols in
which contributors register to participate in a crop modeling
experiment to execute 99 sensitivity tests, generated using a
Latin Hypercube approach, which explore the plausible
range of [CO
2], temperature, and precipitation changes pro-
jected to occur out at the 2070 –2099 time period (Table 1; full
protocols are available at http://www.agmip.org/
c3mp-downloads). These ranges include the projectedextremes from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project (CMIP5; Taylor et al. , 2009) over the vast majority of
agricultural lands and, in fact, are intended to extend slightlybeyond this range to ensure that C3MP results remainrelevant in the event that more extreme projections become
plausible (Fig. 1). In addition to the range of projected tem-
perature increases, sensitivity tests extend to a 1 °C cooling
to understand optimal growing conditions which may be
cooler than the historical baseline. As the C3MP protocols
require the same sensitivity tests for all crop modeling loca-tions, the range of precipitation changes is limited to /C650%
to prevent the sensitivity tests from being too sparse in the
precipitation change space simply to accommodate arid
regions where projections indicate large percentage changes
to small historical precipitation totals. It is important to
mention that changes in rainfall are restricted to changes in
intensity, and changes in the frequency of precipitationevents are not taken into account in this study, even though
they potentially play an important role in ﬁnal yields (Baigor-
riaet al., 2007). Whereas the ﬁnal years of the 21st century
have [CO
2] higher than 900 ppm in the highest Representa-
tive Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5; Moss et al., 2010), the
end-of-century time period (2070 –2099) has a central year
[CO 2] of 801 ppm. The 330 ppm lower limit of the [CO 2]
range helps resolve CO 2sensitivities around the 1980 –2010
historical baseline’s central year [CO 2] in 1995 =360 ppm).
©2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Global Change Biology ,20, 394–407CARBON –TEMPERATURE –WATER CHANGE ANALYSIS 395The sensitivity tests are generated by modifying each day in
the 1980 –2010 climate series to achieve each test’s temperature
change (through addition), precipitation change (through a
multiplicative factor), and [CO 2] (via an imposed concentra-
tion), resulting in 2970 (99 tests 930 years) yields per simula-
tion set. The mean yield (Y) is then calculated for each
sensitivity test and associated with the [CO 2], temperature,
and water changes that deﬁned each test. To understand howclimate changes may affect yield variability (Osborne &
Wheeler, 2013), the coefﬁcient of variation for yield (CV;
across the 30 years) is also calculated. This enables the least-squares ﬁtting of a quadratic crop model emulator for Y and
CV for any given simulation location as a function of carbon
dioxide concentration (CO
2), temperature change (T), and
precipitation change (P) to determine coefﬁcients a –ki ne a c ho f :YðCO 2;T;PÞ¼aþbðTÞþcðTÞ2þdðPÞþeðPÞ2þfðCO 2ÞþgðCO 2Þ2

As the emulators for mean yield and yield CV are ﬁt sepa-
rately, the values of coefﬁcients a –k in Eqn (1) will not be the
same as a –k in Eqn (2). In addition, the impacts response
surfaces deﬁned by these emulators are a better subject of com-
parison than the values of speciﬁc coefﬁcients (the response to
any climatic change is represented in multiple coefﬁcients).
The formulation of this crop model emulator will be an impor-
tant area of ongoing research in C3MP, as it is possible that
some locations’ mean yield or yield CV responses may be bet-
ter captured by other forms (e.g., polynomials of a different
order or logarithmic functions). Howden & Crimp (2005) useda simpler linear emulator, but then Crimp et al. (2008) modiﬁed
this to include quadratics with different orders of polynomials
for [CO
2] (to the fourth order), temperature (to the third order),
and precipitation (to the second order). Ruane et al. (2013) uti-
lized second-order polynomials to emulate impacts response
surfaces for maize in Panama to mimic a yield curve peaking atTable 1 Limits of CTW space, relative to baseline climate
conditions, explored by sensitivity tests. Corresponding base-

[CO 2], but to this point these studies have not included the
cross-variable terms in Eqns (1) and (2). These terms allow fornon-orthogonal curvature in the crop response space resulting
from interactions in the way crop models respond to multiple,
simultaneously changing climate variables. These cross-termsare additionally helpful in understanding how correlated
climate variables affect yields (Sheehy et al. , 2006). Ramankutty
et al. (2013) tested linear, nonlinear, and spline ﬁts for a grass-
land site in Australia, which could be repeated for any site par-
ticipating in C3MP. It should also be noted that these climate
impact emulators are derived from 30-year climatological crop
model results rather than the year-by-year historical climatevariability that is often used to develop statistical crop models
(e.g., Schlenker & Roberts, 2009; Schlenker & Lobell, 2010). The
use of process-based crop models for impacts analysis has theadded beneﬁt of including directly resolved interactions
between various terms and [CO
2] that may be outside of the
range of recent observations in a given region. Lobell & Burke(2010) performed a similar regression using crop model simu-lations (although based on crop model simulations of interan-
nual variability), ﬁnding that quadratic regressions
outperformed linear models.
To ensure consistency across sites and encourage the contri-
bution of crop modeling simulations from regions where cli-
mate information does not exist or is not available, C3MP
provides an estimated daily climate series for the 1980 –2010
historical baseline period. Based on the outputs of the NASA
Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applica-
tions (MERRA; Rienecker et al., 2011) and MERRA-Land
(Reichle et al. , 2011) outputs, these AgMERRA data (A.C. Ru-
ane, unpublished data) were developed for agricultural
impacts applications and are shifted to eliminate apparentmonthly biases in comparison to an ensemble of gridded
observational data from weather stations and satellites (CRU
TS3.10, Harris et al. , 2013; Willmott & Matsuura, 1995; GPCC,
Rudolf & Schneider, 2004; CMORPH, Joyce et al., 2004; PERSI-
ANN, Hsu et al., 1997; TRMM 3B-42, Huffman et al., 2007).
AgMERRA also incorporates the NASA-GEWEX Solar Radia-tion Budget daily radiation data (Zhang et al., 2007) which
have been shown to be highly useful for agricultural modeling
(White et al., 2008), and is stored at a resolution of ¼degree.
Where complete and well-vetted station data are available,
C3MP participants are encouraged to run both the observa-
tional and the AgMERRA climate series through their crop
models to gage uncertainties stemming from the selection of
baseline climate series.
White et al. (2011) summarized the substantial contributions
of crop modeling assessments of climate change impactsaround the world, ﬁnding studies in 69 countries (dominatedby North America and Europe) and using 68 crop models.
There are many missed opportunities for collaboration, how-
ever, because for any given region it is difﬁcult to discover theextent of work that has been completed and to contact crop
modelers with experience over the range of agricultural
systems. Many sites and models have also been calibratedfor operational use, but have never appeared in the peer-
reviewed literature. In some cases differences between variousmodeling studies lead to confusion among the stakeholder
and policymaker communities, as multiple assessments in the
same region can occasionally produce results that appearcontradictory. C3MP is therefore designed to build the
network of crop modelers and crop modeling sites around the
world to conduct climate vulnerability analyses, enable inter-comparison of consistent results, increase communication,
and facilitate future collaborations among participants.
A prototype demonstration of the C3MP protocols and
enabled analyses is provided below to describe the methods
and analyses enabled that are envisioned for all C3MP simula-
tion set locations.
C3MP prototype simulation of peanut yield in Henry
County, Alabama
For this prototype simulation set, the core response of peanut
yields to climate change was simulated in Henry County, Ala-bama, which is located near the heart of a productive peanut-
growing belt in the Southeastern United States (Fig. 2). An
additional site was also conﬁgured in nearby Washington
County, Florida, for the purposes of regional comparison, but
Henry County will be the primary focus of this study.
Peanut simulations were conducted using CROPGRO-
Peanut (Boote et al., 1998), which is an element of the Deci-
sion Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer Cropping
System Model (DSSAT-CSM; Jones et al., 2003). The sensitiv-
ity tests were facilitated by the use of DSSAT’s Environ-mental Modiﬁcations function, which modiﬁes historicalclimate data to achieve each test’s temperature, precipita-
tion, and [CO
2]. The key details of the crop model conﬁgu-
ration are summarized in Table 2, and describe a rain-fedpeanut simulation with planting on April 1st. The simula-
tions use the Georgia Green cultivar, which was calibrated
for phenology, biomass, and yield components at ﬁeld trials

et al., 2003). Weather data from 1980 to 2010 were collected
from the Florida Climate Center (Ofﬁce of the State Clima-tologist, 2012), with radiation estimated from daily tempera-
tures and precipitation. The soil proﬁle was drawn from a
reanalyzed soil dataset (Romero et al., 2012), and manage-
ment followed common local practices. To gage the uncer-
tainty of this conﬁguration and test some of the C3MP
analysis methods below, additional simulation sets were
also conﬁgured. These include a nearly identical simulationset that utilizes an irrigation rule whereby 12 mm applica-
tions of irrigation are applied whenever soil water content
drops below 70% of plant available water in the top 50 cmof the soil proﬁle. Simulations at Washington County, Flor-
ida, were also run that differ only in their use of a local
baseline climate series and soil proﬁle. Lastly, the samesimulations were run for Henry County using baseline cli-
mate series drawn from AgMERRA’s corresponding grid
box. Note that MERRA likely incorporates a version of thestate climatologist data in its underlying data assimilation,
so the skill of AgMERRA in this region may be higher than
in regions where no local weather stations exist. Peanut
simulations in the US Southeast were also conducted by
Shin et al. (2010) with a focus on interannual variability.
Results
Historical baseline evaluation
A comparison between simulated peanut yields and
the 1980 –2010 county-level yields reported by the US
Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Sta-
tistics Service (NASS; USDA, 2012) reveals a high levelof agreement for the rain-fed simulations driven by the
state climatologist observations (Fig. 3; correlation coef-ﬁcient r=0.52; signiﬁcant at 0.01 level using t-test).
Rain-fed simulations driven by the AgMERRA datasetproduced nearly identical correlations ( r=0.5; signiﬁ-
cant at 0.01 level). Irrigated correlations were not signif-
icant for either climate series due to the low prevalence
of irrigation systems in the region. The performance of
rain-fed simulations is particularly strong given that
the county-level yields integrate across a variety ofmanagement types, soil characteristics, cultivars, andapplications across Henry County. Washington Countycorrelations were lower than Henry County, but betterfor AgMERRA ( r=0.29) than for state climatologist
observations ( r=0.19), likely due to heterogeneous
farming practices blurred together in aggregated NASS
yield data. The crop model also assumes that pests,
diseases, and weeds are perfectly controlled, which isnot always the case in the real world.
CTW response surfaces
The emulators ﬁt by Eqns (1) and (2) allow for the esti-mation of crop model response to any point in theCTW change space for Henry County peanuts. To testthe skill of this emulator against the direct simulation
of a given scenario, each of the sensitivity tests was esti-
mated using the emulator and compared to the crop
model’s simulation of that test, resulting in root meansquare deviations (RMSD, as a percentage of mean1980 –2010 yield) of 1.90% and 1.96% for rain-fed condi-
tions with the observed climate and AgMERRA, respec-tively, and Pearson’s correlations ( r
2) greater than 0.99.
For irrigated conditions mean yield RMSD wereslightly smaller (1.25% and 2.3% for the two climate
series). Omitting 20 of these sensitivity tests randomly
did not substantially change the emulator, with RMSDchanging by less than 0.1% of the mean yields and r
2
remaining above 0.99. Yield CV had higher emulator
RMSD in the rain-fed conditions (2.30% and 3.37%;
r2>0.99), and much higher RMSD for irrigated condi-
tions (9.36% and 6.96%; r2>0.98), although the latter is
a result of the much smaller CV for irrigated conditions
that face little or no interannual water stresses. Overall,
the emulators appear to be robustly capturing the coreresponse of the crop model regardless of the baselineclimate series utilized. These emulators may technicallybe extrapolated outside of the C3MP climate changelimits deﬁned in Table 2; however, this must be donewith caution as the statistical properties of the moder-ate-to-large climate changes may not hold in the case of
more extreme climate changes.
The three-dimensional CTW space is most easily
examined by looking at cross sections where one of theTable 2 Overview of the rain-fed peanut model simulation

(Fig. 4). The general response of rain-fed Henry County
mean yields is as might be expected, but the generaldecrease in yields under warmer and drier conditionswith lower [CO
2], as well as the increase in yields in
cooler, wetter, and higher [CO 2] environments may now
be quantiﬁed. Yield CV responds most strongly to pre-
cipitation (wetter conditions leading to lower CV andmore consistent interannual yields), although warmer
conditions have the potential to offset CV decreases
from wetter conditions, probably through a combinationof increased evapotranspiration and a closer proximityto damaging high-temperature thresholds.
These emulators enhance our understanding of crop
model responses in their ability to identify nonlineari-ties in crop response, explore interactions in CTWresponse, and quickly assess climate change scenarios.
For example, if [CO
2] is held at the baseline levels
(Fig. 4a), the sensitivity of mean yield to rising temper-
atures is higher under wet conditions than under drier
conditions, indicating that peanut is more responsive toheat stress when there is no competing water stress.Likewise, if temperatures are held at the baseline levels(Fig. 4c and d), an increase in [CO
2] to 700 ppm can off-
set mean yield losses resulting from a 30% decrease in
growing season precipitation, although the yield CV
will increase by about 25%. Finally, if precipitation isheld constant (Fig. 4e), peanut responds to rising [CO
2]
in a nearly linear fashion if temperatures do not changebut shows diminishing returns and very little response
beyond about 600 ppm when temperatures increase by
more than 5 °C.
To further explore the robustness of these emulators
and the potential for broader C3MP analysis, Fig. 5 pre-
sents differences between the impacts response cross
sections calculated using different climate series (leftcolumn), different locations (middle column), and dif-ferent irrigation regimes (right column). There is very
little difference between an emulator based on the
sensitivity tests applied to the observational climatedataset and that created from sensitivity tests applied tothe AgMERRA dataset. A comparison between Figs 4cand 5c suggests that the use of the AgMERRA climatedataset leads to slightly less optimistic simulations ofthe yield beneﬁts when both [CO
2] and precipitation
rise dramatically, but the overall pattern of response is
very similar. The AgMERRA dataset is therefore a suit-
able alternative for the C3MP exercise for peanut simu-lations in Henry County, which encourages its furtherapplication in regions where observational data are notavailable. Differences between the observed weather
data and the AgMERRA estimates will also elucidateagricultural regions where gridded climate datasets
may be missing key agroclimatic processes.
Although Henry and Washington Counties are only
ca. 100 km apart and have small differences in meanclimate, lower root zone soil saturation levels in HenryCounty lead to unique CTW responses. This is apparent

high in Henry County (0.47) as they are in WashingtonCounty (0.26) due to a higher sensitivity to droughtconditions (correlations between rain-fed yield and
growing season precipitation are 0.79 and 0.62, respec-
tively; both signiﬁcant at P=0.001 level). The overall
pattern of impacts response in Henry and WashingtonCounties is consistent (Fig. 5, center column), althoughWashington County is less sensitive to changes inprecipitation. This highlights the role of water stress asthe major difference between these locations’ CTW
responses, and their differences look very similar to
(although weaker than) the differences between rain-
fed and irrigated conditions at Henry County (Fig. 5,right column; which represent a nearly complete elimi-nation of water stress). A comparison between therain-fed and irrigated conditions also helps quantify
the beneﬁts of irrigation as an adaptation for future cli-mate changes. Both respond in a similar fashion when
temperature increases are above 4 °C and precipitation
is at least as much as in the present climate. Rain-fed
conditions at Henry County are also more responsive
to the beneﬁts of elevated [CO
2] than Washington
County and the irrigated Henry County simulations,illustrating the effects of improved water retention inhigh-CO
2environments (Kimball, 2010).
Instantaneous sensitivities
The framework allows for the calculation of the instan-taneous sensitivity to changes in carbon, temperature,
and water by calculating the slope of the emulated
Fig. 4 Cross sections of crop model emulators based upon sensitivity test results for percent changes (relative to baseline conditions) of
mean peanut yield (a, c, e; left color bar) and changes in the coefﬁcient of variation for yield (b, d, f; right color bar) in Henry County,
Alabama, for (a –b) temperature and precipitation response at baseline [CO 2]; (c–d) precipitation and [CO 2] at baseline temperature;
and (e –f) temperature and [CO 2] at baseline precipitation. The black stars in each panel represent baseline conditions (no change in
temperature or precipitation and 360ppm [CO 2]).

that the response of peanut yield to temperature and
precipitation changes takes the shape of a curved sur-
face that peaks at optimum conditions, the optimalgrowing season climate is found where the slope of thistemperature –water surface is zero (crops are assumed
to respond favorably to increased [CO
2] in all climates).
In general, yields are expected to fall off at an accelerat-ing pace as the climate moves away from these optimalconditions, but the historical baseline climate is not
necessarily optimal. It is important to note that the
sensitivities calculated from the C3MP emulators arebased on 30-year climate shifts, which likely differ fromyield sensitivities to interannual climate shifts (Ruaneet al., 2013).
The instantaneous sensitivities of peanut simulations
in Henry County to changes away from its historicalbaseline climate (marked with a star in Figs 4 and 5)
indicate that optimal conditions are somewhat coolerand wetter than the 1980 –2009 climate. Yields decrease
by 11.7% per 1 °C rise in mean growing season tempera-
ture, and increase by 8.5% per 10% increase in mean
growing season rainfall. Under irrigated conditionsmean yield decreases 8.6% per 1 °C rise and there is no
response to increasing rainfall (indicating that irrigationacts as optimal water conditions). Rain-fed and irrigatedpeanuts respond to a 100 ppm increase in [CO
2] with
similar 12.8% and 11.2% increases in yield, respectively.
Probabilistic Analysis of CMIP5 projections
The C3MP impacts response surfaces also extend the
utility of the 99 sensitivity tests by enabling speciﬁc
scenarios to be rapidly explored. As any scenario can
be summarized by its growing season [CO 2], temperature
change, and precipitation change from the historicalbaseline period, these CTW changes can be pluggedinto the emulators to estimate agricultural impacts.

changes in temperature and precipitation for HenryCounty, Alabama, across various time slices in anensemble of 20 GCMs that contributed to CMIP5. These20 GCMs are the subset that had posted (as of October,2012) daily output through at least 2099 for RCPsreﬂecting higher (RCP8.5) and lower (RCP4.5) [CO
2].
The projections agree on progressive warming over the
course of the 21st century; however, the rate of that
warming is highly dependent on the RCP and there islittle agreement on the direction of precipitationchanges. Incorporating [CO
2] determined for any given
time slice from the RCP, each GCM time-slice projec-
tion was emulated to produce probabilistic estimates ofparticular yield and yield CV thresholds according tothe CMIP5 ensemble (Table 3).
Examining an extreme yield threshold deﬁned by
mean 30-year yields that are only 80% of the meanyields in the historical baseline, the CMIP5 GCMs sug-gest that farmers in Henry County do not face a 20%mean yield decrease until the end-of-century (2070 –
2099) period under RCP4.5 (when only 17 of the 20models have emulated mean yields above this thresh-
old). Under RCP8.5, however, this level of threat is
reached in the mid-century (2040 –2069) and a minority
of the GCMs project yields above this threshold during
the end-of-century time slice. On the other end of thespectrum, farmers hoping for even modest mean yieldincreases ( >105% of the baseline) ﬁnd only a 25% proba-
bility in the near-term (2010 –2039) under RCP4.5 and
then a 10% change beyond that period. Results are simi-lar for irrigated peanut, although the probability of
yield increases is slightly lower (5%).
Yield CV is also projected to increase with very high
probability. For rain-fed conditions only 40% of models
project CVs less than the baseline period in the near
term, with probabilities declining in future periods inboth RCPs. CVs are projected to increase to more than120% of their baseline value by the midcentury periodwith high probability under irrigated conditions (where
CV is already quite small), with all models projecting
higher than 40% increases in CV at the RCP8.5 end ofcentury.
Comparison of CMIP5 and CMIP3 projections
To compare between the current state of the art and the
projections used for a large number of previous climate
change impact studies, Fig. 6b shows a comparison inprojected growing season mean temperature andprecipitation changes among the same 20 CMIP5 GCMs
under RCP8.5 and 16 GCMs from the higher emissions
scenario (A2; SRES, 2000) of the previous-generationCMIP3 (Meehl et al., 2007). CMIP3 and CMIP5 resultspotentially disagree due to updates in GCM resolu-
tions, parameterizations, and processes, as well as dif-
ferences between the RCP8.5 and A2 scenarios’
evolution of greenhouse gas concentrations. RCP8.5reaches higher [CO
2] by the end-of-century period than
does A2 (801 ppm and 734 ppm in 2085, respectively),although values are much closer in the near-term(432 ppm and 434 ppm in 2025) and mid-century(571 ppm and 556 ppm in 2055). Even with a largernumber of models, the CMIP5 projections are in stron-
ger agreement as to Henry County temperature and
precipitation changes than are the CMIP3 projections,
although the most extreme temperature changes are
projected under CMIP5’s higher [CO
2] RCP8.5 scenario.

larger precipitation decreases also project greater
warming, indicating a shift in the ratio of latent andsensible energy ﬂuxes as surface moisture changes.
The emulated yield change distributions presented in
Figure 7 show that the general message of climateimpact projections for rain-fed and irrigated peanutproduction in Henry County has not changed dramati-cally from CMIP3 to CMIP5, with both ensembles sug-gesting yield declines by midcentury and acceleratinglosses into the end-of-century period. CMIP5 RCP8.5
projections suggest slightly larger yield losses than do
the CMIP3 A2 simulations; however, the CMIP3 ensem-
ble shows larger uncertainties in the end-of-centuryperiod. The latest CMIP5 projections are therefore more
consistent and more pessimistic than would have beenassessed in previous-generation CMIP3 impact studies,resulting in CMIP3’s most severe and most optimisticend-of-century projections being eliminated.
Comparison of simulated and emulated climate change
impact projections
As a ﬁnal check on the efﬁcacy of the C3MP sensitivity
tests and emulator approach for Henry Countypeanuts, Figure 8 presents a comparison between thedistribution of CMIP5 yield change projections usingthe C3MP emulators and the distribution resulting
from an impacts assessment using the more traditional
“delta method” (Wilby et al., 2004; White et al., 2011).
In the latter approach, changes in mean monthly tem-
peratures and precipitation (calculated by comparing
the climatologies of a future time slice with the histori-cal baseline period in a given GCM) are imposed on theobserved historical period climate series and then usedto drive crop model simulations.
The emulated yield change distributions and directly
simulated yield change distributions indicate the same
general response of Henry County peanuts to CMIP5
climate changes, with yields declining modestly to the
mid-century and then accelerating losses by the end-of-century period. Median yield change projections (red
lines in Fig. 8a –d) are similar; however, the emulated
yields underestimate the spread in uncertainty sug-gested by the delta method simulations. Direct compar-ison between the emulated and simulated yield changeprojections across all GCMs and time periods (Fig.
8e–h) reveals that the emulators tend to be somewhat
conservative, underestimating the most extreme yielddecreases and increases (a similar underestimation wasfound by Lobell & Burke, 2010). In this case the discrep-ancy is likely a combination of the least-squares ﬁtting
of the emulator as well as differences between using
mean growing season temperature and precipitationTable 3 Probabilistic threshold analysis of CMIP5 results under rain-fed (a, c) and irrigated (b, d) conditions for peanut. Results

delta method simulations. Several GCMs have substan-
tial variation in the way that climate changes within a
growing season; however, these changes do not have asdramatic an impact when averaged over a longer grow-ing season. As C3MP is designed to require only asmall set of sensitivity tests from its global participants,investigation of these subseasonal impacts is left tofollow-on studies.
Discussion
The prototype study at Henry County, Alabama,reveals the potential insight and analyses enabled bythe execution of C3MP sensitivity tests. With only a rel-atively small set of simulations, crop modelers aroundthe world are able to provide the crucial carbon diox-
ide, temperature, and water responses that govern the
main agricultural response to climate change. Analysisof GCM projections and the CTW impacts response sur-faces at Henry County reveal modest yield losses accel-erating beyond the middle of the 21st century, withtemperature and water stresses overwhelming the ben-
eﬁts of enhanced [CO
2]. Generalized crop model emu-
lators provide a robust ﬁt to the sensitivity tests, andresults are consistent between this approach and themore involved delta method approach. These emula-tors allow future scenarios to be rapidly assessed forHenry and Washington County peanuts as was donehere for various RCPs, GCMs, and time periods. Yield
(or CV) change threshold analysis also facilitates risk
management either by probabilistic projection (Table 3)
or in terms of identifying the types of climate changes
that cross important change contours in Fig. 4. Simula-tions based on the AgMERRA climate data also satisfac-torily reproduce those based on the state climatologistobservations, motivating expanded applications ofthese data where local observations are not available.
This analysis at the Henry County site is informative,
but the coordination of a global network of C3MP sitesenables larger analyses including the identiﬁcation ofvulnerable subregions and cropping systems in a givenregion, the relative sensitivities to immediate changesin temperature or precipitation, the forms of emulators
that are robust in various farming systems, and the gen-
eral agreement between crop models or sites with
slightly different cultivars and/or farm management.
C3MP results will also increase our ability to gageuncertainties across regions, scenarios, and crop mod-els, as well as providing points of comparison for globalgridded crop model improvement and examinations ofscale dependency in impacts assessment. When C3MPcrop model emulators are combined with climatemodel emulators under development in the
climate modeling community that produce regional
temperature and precipitation changes based on carbon
dioxide concentrations (e.g., Castruccio et al.,i n
review), the combination will allow for rapid statisticalassessment of regional climate impacts based on green-house gas emissions simulated by integrated assess-ment models.
It is also important to recognize limitations in the
C3MP approach. A focus on growing season tempera-
ture and precipitation changes neglects the likelihoodof subseasonal changes in the frequency, distribution,and extremes of these variables, which could substan-tially affect regional yield changes. C3MP also neglects
to differentiate between changes in minimum tempera-
ture and maximum temperature despite a strong physi-cal basis to expect the former to slightly outpace the
latter. C3MP assumes that current management prac-
tices will persist under future climate conditions, lead-ing to a more pessimistic projection that is better usedto recognize the risk of ignoring climate impacts. Inlight of these limitations, C3MP will be of most use forrapid assessment of new scenarios and to identifyRCP8.5  A2−80−60−40−2002040Rainfed CMIP5 vs. CMIP3 mean yield changes

C3MP increases (and encourages) collaboration
among the global network of participants and moti-vates further studies that can be designed to answer
speciﬁc questions of crop response to particular stresses
or differences between various crop model perfor-mances in a given farming system. High-quality experi-ments, free-air carbon enrichment (FACE; Kimball,2010) facilities, and other ﬁeld trials are still required to

ABSTRACT
Simulations of the preindustrial and doubled CO 2climates are made with the GISS Global Climate Middle
Atmosphere Model 3 using two different estimates of the absolute solar irradiance value: a higher value
measured by solar radiometers in the 1990s and a lower value measured recently by the Solar Radiation and
Climate Experiment. Each of the model simulations is adjusted to achieve global energy balance; without thisadjustment the difference in irradiance produces a global temperature change of 0.4 8C, comparable to the
cooling estimated for the Maunder Minimum. The results indicate that by altering cloud cover the model
properly compensates for the different absolute solar irradiance values on a global level when simulating both
preindustrial and doubled CO
2climates. On a regional level, the preindustrial climate simulations and the
patterns of change with doubled CO 2concentrations are again remarkably similar, but there are some dif-
ferences. Using a higher absolute solar irradiance value and the requisite cloud cover affects the model’s
depictions of high-latitude surface air temperature, sea level pressure, and stratospheric ozone, as well astropical precipitation. In the climate change experiments it leads to an underestimation of North Atlanticwarming, reduced precipitation in the tropical western Paciﬁc, and smaller total ozone growth at high
northern latitudes. Although signiﬁcant, these differences are typically modest compared with the magnitude
of the regional changes expected for doubled greenhouse gas concentrations. Nevertheless, the model sim-ulations demonstrate that achieving the highest possible ﬁdelity when simulating regional climate changerequires that climate models use as input the most accurate (lower) solar irradiance value.
1. Introduction
The sun’s energy is the primary determinant of the
earth’s climate, which changes when there is an imbal-ance between incoming solar energy (at near-ultraviolet
and visible wavelengths) and outgoing terrestrial energy
(at infrared wavelengths). Measurements made by theTotal Irradiance Monitor (TIM) on the Solar Radiationand Climate Experiment (SORCE) (Rottman et al.2005) indicate that the total solar irradiance (TSI)is;1361.3 W m
22(Kopp and Lean 2011), which pro-
vides incoming solar energy of 340 W m22averaged over
the whole earth. The TSI that TIM measures is ;6Wm22
lower than the canonical value of 1367 W m22that many
climate models presently use (Kopp and Lean 2011) andsome 15 W m
22less than initial space-based measure-
ment, made by the Nimbus-7 spacecraft, of 1376 W m22
(Hickey et al. 1980). Extensive laboratory calibration
and assessment establish the lowest of these values as
the most accurate and most likely absolute value of total
solar irradiance.
Reducing total solar irradiance by 6 W m22(;0.4%)
reduces incoming solar energy by 1.5 W m22(the irra-
diance spread over the surface of the earth) and ab-sorbed solar radiation by a little over 1 W m

the solar irradiance value produces an equivalent un-certainty in the earth’s energy balance (the differencebetween incoming and outgoing radiation) that is largerin magnitude than the earth’s current energy imbalance,which climate models estimate to be less than 1 W m
22
(Loeb et al. 2012). An imbalance in the earth’s present-
day incoming (solar) and outgoing (terrestrial) energy is
a harbinger of unrealized climate forcing that may con-
tribute to future climate change.
We investigate the difference that using the new lower
absolute value of total solar irradiance makes in generalcirculation model climate simulations, such as those usedin the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) reports. Were the sun’s total solar irradianceto actually change by 6 W m
22, the resultant climate
forcing of ;1Wm22[assuming climate sensitivity of
0.78C( W m22)21forcing] would be comparable to the
forcing by increasing CO 2concentrations in the industrial
era since 1850 (about 60% of the estimated greenhouse gasforcing). The temperature change that such a decrease
induces is highly signiﬁca nt, with a global value of 20.438C
and regional changes shown in Fig. 1. Coincidentally, suchchanges are of similar magni tude to the climate response
simulated for prescribed solar irradiance change fromthe Maunder Minimum of anomalously low solar activity

duction of 6 W m22does not represent a change over
time. Rather, it is a more accurate estimate of the TSIabsolute value; the change with time that has beenmeasured during the 11-yr solar cycle is a factor of5s m a l l e r ,o fo r d e r1 W m
22. The investigation here,
which is the ﬁrst of its kind, explores the impact thatuncertainty in the absolute level of solar radiation has
on the current (or more precisely the preindustrial)
climate and on climate change simulations.
Climate models used for simulating anthropogenic
climate change are ‘‘calibrated’’ to ensure that theglobal-mean net radiation at the top of the atmosphere,and hence the net heating at the surface, is small. Thisradiation balance is implemented in simulations ofpreindustrial climate against which climate forced sce-
narios are then referenced. In the absence of such
a calibration, the model’s energy imbalance forces oceantemperatures to depart from observed conditions with-out any climate forcing, producing spurious climatetrends. Individual climate models employ a variety ofprocedures to achieve this radiation balance (Solomonet al. 2007, p. 596) but most approaches involve cloud orconvective parameterizations. For example, Goddard
Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Model E tunes the
threshold relative humidity for the initiation of ice andwater clouds to achieve global radiative balance (i.e., netradiation at the TOA within 60.5 W m
22of zero) and
a reasonable planetary albedo (between 29% and 31%)for the 1 3CO
2simulations (Schmidt et al. 2006, p. 163).
It is because of this model ‘‘calibration’’ that differencesin the absolute value of total solar irradiance that vari-
ous models use are assumed not to impact their simu-
lations of climate change.
To test this assumption, we investigate differences in
climate speciﬁcation and climate change that the lower,more accurate, TSI value of 1361.3 W m
22makes rela-
tive to the higher value of 1367.0 W m22.W es i m u l a t et h e
preindustrial climate and a climate with doubled CO 2
concentrations (2 3CO 2) using the coupled atmosphere–
ocean model described in the following section, as well as
speciﬁed preindustrial sea surface temperatures (SSTs)and sea ice [updated from Hurrell et al. (2008) for phase5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project(CMIP5), provided by the Hadley Centre].
2. Climate model and procedures
The GISS Global Climate Middle Atmosphere Model
3 (Rind et al. 2007), which we refer to as Model 3, hasbeen employed for many experiments involving increasedatmospheric CO
2concentrations, solar irradiance varia-
tions (Rind et al. 2008), and paleoclimate simulations.The model includes a full middle atmosphere (top at
;85 km) and is coupled to the Russell et al. (1995) ocean
model, which is similar to the ocean model used in theGISS–IPCC ‘‘Er’’ experiments (Schmidt et al. 2006).When Model 3 is run with doubled atmospheric CO
2
concentrations to equilibrium in a ‘‘ qﬂux’’ mode, it has
a sensitivity of about 2.8 8C [0.78C( Wm22)21] (note that
theq-ﬂux mode is not used in these experiments).
The version of Model 3 that we use here has
48latitude 358longitude resolution and 23 vertical
atmospheric layers. Climate simulations are made usingeither the dynamical ocean or speciﬁed SSTs and sea ice(for preindustrial times, 1876–85, available from theHadley Centre at http://www.metofﬁce.gov.uk/hadobs/hadsst3/). Since the model covers the full middle atmo-sphere, a difference in the level of solar radiation input
to the model affects solar absorption at higher altitudes
near the stratopause as well as in the troposphere. Alinearized ozone photochemistry scheme (McLindenet al. 2000) is employed in the stratosphere to morefully assess the impact of different solar irradiancelevels in this region and to calculate ozone directly,while a simpliﬁed ozone photochemical scheme adaptedfrom the Goddard Earth Observing System chemical
transport model (GEOS-Chem) results is used in the
troposphere (Rind et al. 2007).
Similar to all GISS models, Model 3, like Model E,
achieves approximate radiative balance (in 1 3CO
2runs,
i.e., with no external climate forcing) by adjusting itsparameterization of cloud formation. The GISS models,including Model 3, derive clouds via a probabilistic rep-resentation of the chance of forming a cloud compared
with the relative humidity speciﬁed for the particular
model gridbox and atmospheric layer (Yao and DelGenio 1999). In practice, the relative humidity is com-pared with a random number (from a random numbergenerator) at each time step; a cloud is allocated to ﬁll thegrid box when its relative humidity exceeds the randomn u m b e r .H o w e v e r ,w h i l et h ec h a n c eo fg e t t i n gac l o u di smuch greater with a relative humidity of 90% than 10%,
there is no certainty in either case. When a cloud is
deemed present, it is presumed to occupy 100% of thegrid box for that atmospheric level; otherwise, there is0% cloud cover in that level. On a monthly average, thisfull cloud cover in each grid box occurring part of thetime produces a similar radiative response to calculat-ing partial cloud cover in the grid box all of the time(A. Lacis 2013, personal communication), for which the
random number could also have been used.
In Model 3, the tuning parameter of choice for in-
vestigating the impact of different solar irradiance valuesis the initial relative humidity at which the calculation isbegun. Since even a 10% relative humidity occasionally1102 JOURNAL OF CLIMATE V OLUME 27produces a cloud with this scheme, the lower the relative
humidity at which the procedure is initiated, the greaterthe cloud cover. Observations do not indicate with anygreat precision what the relationship between relativehumidity and cloud formation should be, and it is likelyto be situation dependent. Nevertheless, this approachproduces the broad representation of cloud cover seenin various datasets (e.g., Schmidt et al. 2006). As noted
above, from Schmidt et al., the procedure is not entirely
without an overall constraint as observations do indicatethat the model planetary albedo should be ;30%.
Clouds can have both positive and negative effects on
the earth’s radiation balance, but in general the greaterthe cloud cover the larger the atmospheric and planetaryalbedos, the smaller the solar energy present in the cli-mate system. This is evident in both observations [e.g.,
Kiehl and Trenberth (1997), who found clouds produce
an e tc o o l i n go f 220 W m
22] and models [Solomon
et al. (2007, p. 768) where the global annual mean effectof cloud cover averaged over all models for 1980–99 is222.3 W m
22]. Thus, in the Model 3 simulations, changing
the incoming absolute solar irradiance value requires thatthe initial relative humidity for starting the cloud cal-culation also be changed to maintain radiative balance.
Speciﬁcally, when substituting a total solar irradiance
value of 1361.3 for 1367.0 W m
22the initial relative hu-
midity is raised from 82.7% to 83.1%, which reduces theglobal cloud cover from 58.3% to 57.8% and admits moresolar radiation to the earth system, thereby compensatingfor reducing the incident energy value spread over theearth from 341.8 to 340.4 W m
22. In the simulations made
using speciﬁed sea surface temperatures and sea ice for
the two solar irradiance values, the compensatory initial
relative humidity for cloud formation changed from81.45% for TSI 51367.0 to 81.97% for TSI 51361.3.
Changing the cloud cover in a climate model affects
multiple aspects of the climate system and potentiallyimpacts climate sensitivity as well. Furthermore, achiev-ing a new radiation balance on a global basis does notnecessarily preclude local radiation imbalances, which
may well differ for different amounts of incoming solar
radiant energy; for example, in regions where cloudcover is absent in either case, higher incident solar ra-diation deposits more energy at the surface. To assessthe consequences of different levels of incident solar ra-diation, we performed a suite of experiments, summa-rized in Table 1, with two different values of TSI each fortwo different levels of atmospheric CO
2concentrations,
corresponding to preindustrial (270 ppm) and doubled
CO 2(540 ppm) conditions.
Radiation balance is achieved as described above for
each of the four simulations identiﬁed as runs 1 and 2(made with a dynamic ocean) and runs 1S and 2S (madewith speciﬁed sea surface temperatures), in Table 1, by
adjusting the cloud formation probability to make thenet radiation at the top of the atmosphere and at thesurface approximately zero. We then assess (section 3)the model outputs to determine whether the simulationsmade with two different absolute solar irradiance valuesand their corresponding cloud coverage differ notice-ably in their speciﬁcation of the present-day climate
(recognizing that differences between the preindustrial
and current climate atmospheric conditions will existwith both irradiance values). If so, are these differencesassociated with atmosphere–ocean interactions (runs 1and 2), or do they exist even with the same (speciﬁed)preindustrial sea surface temperatures (runs 1S and 2S)?In section 4, we investigate whether the different modelconﬁgurations associated with the two different solar
irradiance values produce different climate sensitivities
or change any characteristics of the climate system sim-ulated with doubled levels of CO
2(runs 3 and 4). We also
assess how much of the differences are associated with theatmosphere–ocean interaction versus the atmosphere–land response alone (runs 3S and 4S) by using the samespeciﬁed SSTs and sea ice in each run, obtained from thelast 100 years of run 3.
All Model 3 simulations made using the coupled dy-
namical ocean, both for preindustrial (270 ppm) anddoubled (540 ppm) CO
2concentrations (runs 1, 2, 3, and
4 in Table 1), were extended for 500 years. Although thistime is insufﬁcient to achieve true equilibrium, the at-mospheric climate parameters are relatively stable longbefore 500 years; the results given in Table 2 are aver-ages over model simulation years 100–500. The changes
from these numbers for averages of just the last 100 years
are shown in parenthesis, and they indicate little dif-ference from the 400-yr averaging, emphasizing thestability of the results. Because the speciﬁed SST runs(1S, 2S, 3S, and 4S) have much less variability or trend,TABLE 1. Input parameters and GISS Model 3 conﬁgurations

As noted above, the model conﬁguration includes
ozone calculations in the stratosphere, so reducing thesolar irradiance value also reduces the ultraviolet (UV)portion of the spectrum that affects ozone. Since not allclimate models incorporate online chemistry calcula-tions, often using prescribed ozone instead, this portionof the ‘‘adjustment’’ to solar irradiance may not alwaysbe applicable. To test its impact, additional 500-yr runs
with the lower solar irradiance value were made without
altering the UV irradiance for the ozone calculation(run 2oz). Most of the tropospheric responses werecomparable but, as expected, signiﬁcant stratosphericconsequences arose and are described.
3. Preindustrial simulations
Listed in Table 2 are global annual diagnostics from
the Model 3 runs made using the dynamic ocean. Theﬁrst two columns correspond to the preindustrial (1 3
CO
2) simulations using, respectively, the standard GISS
model solar irradiance value of 1367.0 W m22, run 1(column 1), and an alternate value of 1361.3 W m22, run
2 (column 2), indicative of the SORCE lower value,
which is the more probable true level of the sun’s irra-
diance. Results are 400-yr averages (from year 101 to500) and, in parenthesis, the difference of the 400-yraverage from the average over only the last 100 yr; thatthe differences are quite small indicates that the modelswere in equilibrium over the 400-yr time frame. In thesimulations made with the lower solar irradiance value(column 2), the low-level cloud cover is 48.1%, reduced
from 48.6%, and the planetary albedo is 30.71, reduced
from 30.92. Owing to this compensating change, the netradiation at the top of the atmosphere, and the net heatat the surface, differ by less than 0.1 W m
22when using
the lower solar irradiance value, with incoming andoutgoing radiation amounts that differ by 0.2–0.3 W m
22.
The global, annual average surface air temperature andintegrated atmospheric temperatures are about 0.1 8C
cooler in the run with the lower solar irradiance, and
there is a corresponding small reduction in the watervalue amount in the atmosphere, as well as a slight in-crease in snow cover. Despite cloud cover differences, thegreenhouse efﬁciency of the atmosphere is essentiallyTABLE 2. Global annual averages for years 101–500 of the Model 3 simulations.

differences from the 400-yr averages obtained when averaging over just the last 100 years.

compensation largely eradicates the impact of usingdifferent solar irradiance values in the Model 3 speciﬁ-cation of the preindustrial climate.
Differences in regional climate speciﬁed with the two
different values of solar irradiance can be somewhat
larger than the global differences even with the Model 3
radiation budget parameters nominally calibrated tohave zero difference globally. Shown in Fig. 2 are 400-yrannual-averaged differences determined as run 1 (highersolar irradiance) minus run 2 (lower solar irradiance) fornet radiation at the surface (Fig. 2a), total cloud cover

surface (Fig. 2a) is of mixed sign, with a tendency for
greater radiation at the surface at high latitudes and lessin the tropics. This is a direct result of the different cloudcover parameterizations (Fig. 2b) with total (and low)cloud cover a few percent higher (in absolute terms) in

The surface energy differences also affect the sea ice
distribution with notably less sea ice around most of
Antarctica associated with the greater positive surfaceradiation that accompanies the higher absolute value ofsolar irradiance. The planetary albedo differences (Fig.2c) reﬂect the cloud and surface responses, with re-ductions of up to 1% (absolute) where sea ice and cloudsare both diminished and increases of up to 1% wheretropical cloud cover has increased.
Unfortunately, cloud cover observations are not sufﬁ-
ciently constrained for us to assess whether the differencesnecessitated by altering cloud cover to accommodate thereduced solar insolation makes Model 3 more or lessaccurate in that respect. The differences shown in Fig. 2are of order 1%, and International Satellite Cloud Cli-
matology Project cloud observations on a monthly av-
erage are accurate to only 3% (http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/
index.html). Similarly, the difference in net radiation atthe surface is less than 2 W m

comparisons with other observations.
Regional impacts of different TSI values are also ev-
ident in other Model 3 climate parameters, which Fig. 3illustrates. Shown are the differences in surface air
temperature (Fig. 3a), sea level pressure (Fig. 3b), and
precipitation (Fig. 3c), which are similarly determined asrun 1 (higher solar irradiance) minus run 2 (lower solarirradiance). Sea level pressure is less at higher latitudeswhere the air has been made less stable owing to more
FIG. 3. As in Fig. 2, but in annual climate parameters for (a) the surface air temperature, (b) sea
level pressure, and (c) precipitation.1106 JOURNAL OF CLIMATE V OLUME 27surface radiative forcing and greater surface air tem-
perature, with minimal differences in the tropics. Manyof the temperature differences arise from advectivechanges associated with altered wind ﬂow due to the sealevel pressure response. Higher temperatures also occurin the regions of sea ice reduction, especially aroundAntarctica.
In addition to these latitudinal differences, when using
the higher solar irradiance value there is also a general
tendency for Model 3 to preferentially reduce pre-cipitation over the oceans and increase it over land, asevident in Fig. 3c (the ratio of precipitation over land tothat over the ocean grows by about 1%). Certain landregions have little cloud cover to begin with, and thus the
reduced cloud cover needed to calibrate the model forthe lower values of solar irradiance has little effect.Without altered cloud cover the net radiation at thesurface (driven by net solar radiation at the top of theatmosphere) tends to be larger when using the higherabsolute solar irradiance value (e.g., the Sahara, Fig. 2a).This leads to relative ascent over land with corresponding
subsidence over the ocean and consequent precipitation
anomalies. The signiﬁcance of each of these differences isdiscussed below in comparison with the standard errors inthe mean values of the 1 3CO
2run (run 1), which are
shown in Fig. 4.

are shown on the right.1FEBRUARY 2014 R I N D E T A L . 1107Different levels of solar irradiance also affect the
Model 3 stratospheric parameters, including the ozonedistribution, especially at high northern latitudes. Figure 5shows differences in total ozone when using two dif-
ferent absolute values of total solar irradiance (Fig. 5a)
and the standard error in the mean values (Fig. 5b).Most notable is an overestimation of a few Dobsonunits (DU) in the total column ozone at high northernlatitudes when using the higher solar irradiance value,a difference that is about ﬁve times larger than thestandard error in the model’s mean values. In general,with the higher value of total solar irradiance, Model 3
produces larger atmospheric temperatures at all levels
in the troposphere and stratosphere, of order 0.15 8C
relative to the lower irradiance level. Figure 6a showsthe differences in the vertical proﬁle of the zonally aver-aged temperature. The simulated warmer conditions bythemselves lead to a reduction of ozone concentrations ingeneral (0.03% DU decrease) in the experiment in whichUV spectral irradiance remained unchanged (run 2oz), as
shown in Fig. 6b. However, when the UV irradiance is
also reduced, consistent with SORCE’s overall lowertotal solar irradiance value, using the higher solar(and UV) irradiance produces higher ozone levels atmost locations in the stratosphere by 1.3 DU overall(Table 1), because of larger (by 0.5%) photochemical
production. Figure 6c shows the corresponding differ-ences at different altitudes. Poleward transport is alsooverestimated (by 0.5%–1%) in both hemispheres, pri-
marily associated with the increased atmospheric loading.
Figure 6d shows that these dynamical differences arelarger and located farther poleward in the NorthernHemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere, as evidentin the resultant distribution (Fig. 5a). The result of theoverestimated temperature, photochemistry, and dy-namics is an overestimate by some 4 Dobson units (1%)of the total column ozone at high northern latitudes when
using the higher solar irradiance value.
Most of the climate speciﬁcation differences depicted
above, while understandable (and reproducible in thesimulations with no solar UV spectrum changes for ozonephotochemistry), are small. Differences in global annualaverages are not statistically signiﬁcant by comparisonwith the standard deviations of the model runs. There-fore, the procedure by which net radiation balance is
assured with the differing solar irradiance values proves
to be sufﬁcient to minimize differences in the Model3 global annual-average sim ulations of preindustrial
climate, at least from the perspective of the model’sinherent variability.

climate using two different absolute values of solar irradiance, the year 101–500 average dif-ferences of run 1 2run 2. (b) The standard error in the mean ozone value from run 1. Zonal
averages are shown on the right.1108 JOURNAL OF CLIMATE V OLUME 27In speciﬁc regions the differences can, however, reach
signiﬁcant levels, even though compensating tendenciesminimize the global average changes. Figure 4 shows the
regional distribution of the standard error (the stan-
dard deviation divided by the square root of the samplesize) in run 1 (for simulation years 100–500) for totalclouds (Fig. 4a), surface air temperature (Fig. 4b), sealevel pressure (Fig. 4c), precipitation (Fig. 4d), andtotal ozone (Fig. 5b). These indicate the Model 3 in-herent variability. Differences in the radiation budgetand climate parameters shown in Figs. 1 and 2 for two
different solar irradiance values are signiﬁcant at the
95% level when they are larger than twice the standarderror of their 1 3CO
2simulations shown in Fig. 4. This
is true for tropical cloud cover differences (Fig. 2bcompared with Fig. 4a), high-latitude surface air
temperature differences (Fig. 3a compared with Fig.
4b), and sea level pressure differences (Fig. 3b com-pared with Fig. 4c). Regional precipitation differencesare comparable to, or only marginally larger than, thestandard error in the 1 3CO
2run (Fig. 3c compared with
Fig. 4d). The impact of using different input solar ir-radiance values is especially evident on the Model 3speciﬁcation of total ozone, where high-latitude dif-
ferences on the order of 4 DU (Fig. 5a) exceed, by
a factor of 5 or more, the standard error (Fig. 5b).

point in their development, to shorten the simulationtime when investigating different approaches to atmo-spheric physics and numerical parameterizations. SSTs
are also speciﬁed when calibrating parameterizations to
produce near-zero net radiation balance for the currentclimate (e.g., Schmidt et al. 2006). So the impact thata change in total solar irradiance has on that conﬁgu-ration is also of interest. With the additional simulationsdesignated runs 1S, 2S, 3S, and 4S in Table 1, we in-vestigate what proportion of the differences results fromthe interaction of the atmosphere and ocean via the
coupled models compared with that generated simply by
the effect of the altered solar irradiance and cloud coveron the atmosphere–land system. Runs 1S and 2S bothused the same speciﬁed preindustrial sea surface tem-peratures and sea ice and were assessed similarly to theresults shown in the Figs. 2, 3, and 5 (which used a dy-namic ocean). These additional simulations (not shown)using speciﬁed SSTs indicate that differences in cloud
cover, planetary albedo, and net radiation at the surface
over the tropical oceans (Figs. 2b,c) are also present whenthe sea surface temperatures are speciﬁed. This suggeststhat these differences are independent of ocean in-teraction; they are actually slightly reduced in magni-tude with the coupled ocean response. In contrast,differences in the vicinity of Antarctica are the result ofatmosphere–ocean interactions via effects of the dy-
namic ocean sea ice change. Differences in surface air
temperature over land for the most part occur withoutan ocean response, while those over the ocean (includinghigh northern latitudes) require it. Correspondingly, dif-ferences in sea level pressure are greatly affected by theocean thermal response over the ocean, while differences
over land (including Antarctica) are similar in both sets ofruns (i.e., with the dynamic ocean and with speciﬁed seasurface temperatures). Tropical precipitation differ-
ences are quite distinct in the simulations made with and
without ocean feedbacks, as they are inﬂuenced by cir-culation changes induced by land–ocean temperaturegradients. In the stratosphere the ozone differences (Fig.5) do not feel much inﬂuence from the dynamic ocean,especially in the polar regions. We conclude, therefore,that a number of the differences induced by altered solarradiation and cloud cover maintain their characteristic
nature regardless of whether the ocean responds (so
would be apparent in AMIP style runs), especially awayfrom extratropical oceanic regions.
4. Model validation
We compare the simulations of the preindustrial cli-
mate made using two different input total solar irradiance
values with current observations. For the global average
radiation parameters listed in Table 2 the differences aregenerally too small to provide a clear indication ofpreference relative to current observations. We com-pare in Table 3 global annual averages of three metrics,each calculated on the 4 8latitude 358longitude grid—
speciﬁcally the mean biases (mean), root-mean-squarebiases (RMS), and spatial correlation coefﬁcient (SCC,
calculated using the Moran coefﬁcient)—to statistically
compare the two preindustrial simulations with obser-vations of temperature, precipitation and sea levelpressure. Table 3 lists the average comparison of theModel 3 simulations with the observational datasets; theTABLE 3. Comparison of Model 3 climate simulations with observations at the gridbox level. Listed are the averages (and in parentheses
the standard deviations) of the mean, root-mean-square difference, and serial correlation coefﬁcient of the simulations and selectedobservational datasets.

The smaller the difference in themeans and rms values and the larger the SCC, the betterthe model reproduction of the observations.
As the values in Table 3 indicate for all three climate
parameters considered, the differences in the Model 3simulations using different absolute solar irradiancevalues are very small, generally less than the standarddeviations of the model’s comparisons with the differentobservational datasets. Hence, for these parameters, asfor the radiative values, the compensation approachused to adjust for the different solar radiation value that
Model 3 uses produces 1 3CO
2simulations that are
practically indistinguishable.
We also compare with current climate observations
the simulations made using speciﬁed (preindustrial) seasurface temperatures and sea ice. As might be expectedfor most of the parameters listed in Table 2, differenceswhen using total solar irradiance values of 1361.3 and1367.0 W m
22are even less when the SSTs are speciﬁed
(which is why their radiative results are not given in
Table 2). Table 3 gives the relationship to observationsof these simulations made with the two solar irradiancevalues and compensatory change of initial relative hu-midity for cloud formation. As with the simulations us-ing a dynamic ocean, there is minimal difference in therelationship to observations between the two runs madeusing speciﬁed sea surface temperatures. As expected,
most of the comparisons improve slightly with speciﬁed
SSTs (smaller mean and RMS differences, higher SCC).For example, the RMS temperature bias is reduced by25% when speciﬁed SSTs are used. Note also that part ofthe error in both sets of simulations (dynamical oceanand speciﬁed SSTs) is because the comparisons pertainto simulations of preindustrial climate with currentconditions; for example, when run with speciﬁed mod-
ern SSTs, the mean temperature error is only half as
large and the RMS error is (further) reduced by 10%–15%. The conclusion is then the same as in the previoussection: compensation for using different solar irradi-ance values successfully mitigates most of the effect thiswould have on the 1 3CO
2simulation, at least in com-
parison with present uncertainties in observed climate,even though some of the differences are larger than themodel’s inherent variability.
5. Climate sensitivity and change
In this section, we investigate how the two different
absolute solar irradiance values and their corresponding
cloud cover adjustments affect the Model 3 climatesensitivity and simulation of anthropogenic climatechange. To address this, as indicated earlier, additionalsimulations were made (runs 3 and 4 in Table 1) in whichthe CO
2concentrations were instantaneously doubled
and the model run for 500 years with the coupled ocean(the simulations were actually begun some 100 years
after the 1 3CO
2run started and appeared to have sta-
bilized). Columns 3 and 4 of Table 2 give the globalannual-average results.
Considering ﬁrst the 2 3CO
2experiments themselves,
the differences between them directly (run 3 versus run4) are visually very similar to the differences in the13CO
2simulations (shown in Figs. 2 and 3), although at
times with somewhat muted amplitude. So the bias that
a different solar irradiance level introduces to the
13CO 2runs carries over, qualitatively at least, into the
climate change simulations.
Although qualitatively quite similar, changes in cli-
mate simulated using two different absolute solar irra-diance values are not identical. To understand how thevalue of solar radiation in the preindustrial simulationsimpacts climate change assessments, we compare the
23CO
2minus 1 3CO 2climate change for the two dif-
ferent solar irradiance values (i.e., we compare run 3minus run 1, indicative of anthropogenic climate changewith the higher solar irradiance value, with run 4 minusrun 2, indicate of anthropogenic climate change with thelower, more probable total irradiance value).
Both Model 3 simulations (i.e., using the two different
total solar irradiance values) made with 2 3CO
2remain
out of radiation balance for the duration of the runs, by
0.7 W m22. As noted earlier, the Model 3 doubled CO 2
sensitivity (when run with a q-ﬂux ocean, not in these
experiments) is 2.8 8C for;4Wm22radiative forcing, so
the imbalance would result in projected additionalwarming of ;0.58C. The doubled CO
2warming with the
dynamic ocean at the end of 500 yr for the higher solarirradiance is 2.51 8C, the same as with the lower value.
Hence, the compensation for the altered solar irradiance
does not change climate sensitivity on a global basis.
We next consider how the patterns of climate change
for doubled CO
2concentrations differ. Shown in the top
panels of Figs. 7–11 are the changes in total cloud cover1FEBRUARY 2014 R I N D E T A L . 1111(Fig. 7), surface air temperature (Fig. 8), sea level
pressure (Fig. 9), precipitation (Fig. 10), and total ozone(Fig. 11), for the 2 3CO
2minus 1 3CO 2climate change
simulations using the higher solar irradiance value(1367.0 W m
22). For comparison, the middle panels in
each of the ﬁve ﬁgures show the corresponding changesusing the lower solar irradiance value (1361.3 W m
22),
and in the bottom panels are the differences between the
top and middle panels, that is, (run 3 minus run 1) minus
(run 4 minus run 2). In each case, the patterns in the toppanel and the middle panel are visually quite similar sothat, at least qualitatively, the Model 3 parameterizedcompensation for different absolute solar irradiancevalues successfully mitigates differences in simulated
climate change.
Total cloud cover increases in some regions and de-
creases in others as climate changes in response to23CO
2, by up to 6% (Figs. 7a,b). The overall pattern of
cloud cover response, irrespective of the solar irradiancevalue, is associated with increased upward motion in thetropics, owing to greater latent heat release as the cli-
mate warms in response to increasing greenhouse gas
concentrations; subsidence increases in the subtropicsand midlatitudes. Many anthropogenic warming exper-iments demonstrate this response (e.g., Solomon et al.2007, Fig. 10.10), which is a combination of an expanded

the changes [(a) minus (b)]. Zonal averages are shown on the right.1112 JOURNAL OF CLIMATE V OLUME 27Hadley Cell inﬂuence and reduced extratropical storm
intensity owing to reduced temperature gradients (higherlatitudes warm more than lower latitudes). With a higher
solar irradiance value, Model 3 underestimates the in-
crease in cloud cover in the eastern Paciﬁc and tropicalwestern Paciﬁc in the vicinity of Indonesia (Fig. 7c).While not negligible, these differences are generally lessthan 1% (16% relatively). They occur in regions wherecloud cover was greater in the 1 3CO
2run with the
higher solar irradiance value, so the effect of reducingsurface energy in the 1 3CO
2simulations seems to limit
the increase in the 2 3CO 2simulations.
Corresponding changes in annual surface air temper-
ature in response to doubled CO 2concentrations also
have a characteristic pattern, independent of the absolutesolar irradiance value (Figs. 8a,b), with relatively morewarming at higher latitudes and over continental regions
(e.g., Eurasia), aided by snow cover reduction, com-pared to nearby oceans. The North Atlantic warms less
than surrounding regions owing to a reduction in North
Atlantic Deep Water production and associated pole-ward ocean heat transport, again similar to many climatewarming experiments (e.g., Solomon et al. 2007, Fig.10.8). However, there is a tendency for the areas thatwere warmer in the respective 1 3CO
2simulations to
have less warming in the climate change experiment: Itwas usually warmer in the 1 3CO
2run owing to the lo-
cally reduced cloud cover needed to achieve global en-
ergy balance with the higher input solar irradiance. Partof the reason for the reduced warming with climatechange is that in these regions there is now less cloudcover to lose.
FIG. 8. As in Fig. 7, but for surface air temperature.1FEBRUARY 2014 R I N D E T A L . 1113Sea ice changes arising from the doubled CO 2con-
centrations also contribute. Where there is less sea ice inthe 13CO
2runs, less can potentially be lost, and with
the larger solar irradiance value there is less sea ice.
Differences in sea ice between the two climate changesimulations are relatively large, on the order of tens ofpercent (relatively) in both hemispheres. Using thelarger solar irradiance value results in an underestimateof North Atlantic warming, speciﬁcally, and, more gen-erally, higher-latitude warming in both hemispheres.
The sea level pressure differences resulting from dou-
bled atmospheric CO
2concentrations are shown in Figs.
9a and 9b. Both hemispheres have lower pressure athigher latitudes, irrespective of the solar irradiance value,which is an expression at the surface of more positivenorthern and southern annular modes. This response isalso a general feature of climate warming experiments
(e.g., Rind et al. 2005; Solomon et al. 2007) and is due to1) greater warming in the tropical upper troposphere
relative to extratropical latitudes, leading (from the
thermal wind relationship) to 2) increased zonal westwinds in the subtropics and hence 3) greater equator-ward planetary wave refraction, and thus 4) greaterpoleward momentum transport (e.g., Rind et al. 2005).Although the basic pattern remains the same, the effecton sea level pressure of using a larger value of solar ir-radiance (Fig. 9c) is greater reduction (less reduction) in
the Northern Hemisphere (Southern Hemisphere), as
explained below. Unlike the situation with the two13CO
2runs (Fig. 3), the advec tive differences due to
these slightly different sea level pressure responseshave only a slight inﬂuence on the resulting surface air
FIG. 9. As in Fig. 7, but for sea level pressure.1114 JOURNAL OF CLIMATE V OLUME 27temperature differences (Fig. 8), which are dominated
by the radiative responses as discussed above.
The precipitation anomalies for the double CO 2sim-
ulations, shown in Figs. 10a and 10b, although not iden-
tical on the scale of several grid boxes, are quite similarwhen using two different solar irradiance values; bothshow increased tropical upwelling and subtropical sub-sidence in response to warming from increased green-house gas concentrations (e.g., Solomon et al. 2007, Fig.10.12). The primary differences, evident in Fig. 10c, sug-gest that using the higher solar irradiance value for cli-
mate change simulations may underestimate the increase
in precipitation (as it did for cloud cover) in the easternand especially western Paciﬁc regions. Again, wherecloud cover was greater in the 1 3CO
2run, and the sur-
face energy less, the precipitation increase was limited.Total ozone column changes associated with doubled
CO 2climate change simulated using the higher and
lower solar irradiance values are shown in Figs. 11a and
11b. According to Model 3, in a warmer climate total
ozone increases in the extratropics and decreasesslightly in the tropics. The extratropical increases are theresult of accelerated ozone photochemical generationbetween 1 and 10 mb associated with colder strato-spheric temperatures, as in this region the increasedCO
2concentrations enhance radiative cooling to space.
Figure 12a illustrates the vertical proﬁle of the zonal
mean temperature change for the doubled CO 2climate,
with cooling evident everywhere above about 100 mb.Figure 12c shows the corresponding vertical proﬁle ofthe zonal mean change in ozone photochemistry. Theincreased ozone is advected poleward and downward at
FIG. 10. As in Fig. 7, but for precipitation.1FEBRUARY 2014 R I N D E T A L . 1115subtropical and polar latitudes as a result of the north-
ward and vertical transport changes shown in Figs. 13aand 13c, respectively. The increased transport is not due
simply to the greater availability of ozone but also to an
ampliﬁed stratospheric residual circulation in thewarmer climate (e.g., Rind et al. 1990), which bringsmore low ozone air from the troposphere into thetropical stratosphere, explaining the tropical response.
The differences that the absolute solar irradiance
value makes to simulations of total ozone in a warmingclimate are shown in Fig. 11c. Corresponding differences
in the vertical temperature, ozone photochemistry, and
transport changes are shown in Figs. 12b,d and 13b,d.While the spatial and vertical patterns of change are verysimilar in each of the 2 3CO
2simulations, the slightly
warmer temperatures with the higher solar irradiancevalue (0.1 8–0.28C, Fig. 6a) reduce the photochemical
productivity in the upper stratosphere (by 2% overallrelative to the standard run, Fig. 12d), lessening the
ozone increase slightly (Table 2). This deﬁcit is then
advected to the North Pole, producing the total ozonedifferences evident in Fig. 11c. Note that, in Fig. 11c,total ozone over the North Atlantic is an exception tothis general pattern since here the climate change ex-periments using higher solar irradiance produce highertotal ozone. The residual circulation actually strengthensabout 10% more in the 2 3CO
2simulation made with the
higher solar irradiance value, as can be seen by noting
that the changes in ozone vertical transport (Fig. 13d) areof roughly the same structure as the D23CO
2transports
[Fig. 13c, increased downward (upward) transport wherethere was relative downward (upward) transport in the
FIG. 11. As in Fig. 7, but for total ozone.1116 JOURNAL OF CLIMATE V OLUME 27climate change run], and this occurs despite the overall
reduced photochemical generation. Nevertheless, thepoleward transport change in the 2 3CO
2simulation
results in relatively greater ozone convergence in thisregion (Fig. 13b; ;668N, 100–10 mb), overcoming the
production deﬁcit.
The underestimate of ozone in the Northern Hemi-
sphere polar lower stratosphere when using the higher
solar irradiance value results in relatively colder tem-peratures in the 2 3CO
2climate (Fig. 12b), which re-
duces the tropospheric stability in that region. This isthen responsible for the relatively reduced sea levelpressure (Fig. 9c). Note that a similar effect does not
occur over the Southern Hemisphere pole—not the re-duced ozone, the colder polar lower stratosphere tem-peratures, nor the lower sea level pressure.
How signiﬁcant are differences in the doubled CO
2
climate change scenarios simulated using two differentabsolute values of solar irradiance? To assess this, we
compare the ‘‘difference of the differences’’ in total
cloud cover, surface air temperature, sea level pressure,precipitation, and total ozone (Figs. 7c, 8c, 9c, 10c, and11c) with the standard errors of average values of thesimulations (Figs. 4 and 5b). We note that the difference
FIG. 12. Zonal average altitude proﬁles of the year 101–500 changes in two simulations of climate change for
doubled CO 2concentrations made using two different solar irradiance values: (a) the average temperature changes
and (b) the differences of the temperature changes; (c) the average changes in net photochemical production ofozone and (d) the differences of the net photochemical production changes.1F
EBRUARY 2014 R I N D E T A L . 1117of the differences deemed statistically signiﬁcant are
often just the more extreme aspects of a pattern of
response.
A comparison of Figs. 7c and 4a indicates that, where
total cloud cover changes are large, they are likely sig-niﬁcant. So, for example, in tropical regions differencesof 1% pertaining to the two different solar irradiancevalues (Fig. 7c) are likely signiﬁcant, being a factor of5 or so larger than the standard error in the mean total
cloud cover (Fig. 4a). This can be compared with climate-
driven changes of ;6% (e.g., in the vicinity of Indonesia,
Figs. 7a,b).
The underestimate (by more than 0.5 8C, Fig. 8c) of
surface air temperature changes in the North Atlanticregion (50 8–708N) arising from doubled CO
2concen-
trations when using the higher solar irradiance value are
also likely signiﬁcant since the standard error in themean surface air temperature in this region is of order0.18C (Fig. 4b). The differences of similar magnitude
(0.58C) in high-latitude Southern Hemisphere climate
change using the two different irradiance values arelikely not as signiﬁcant. Similarly the Northern Hemi-sphere sea level pressure differences are more signiﬁ-
cant than are the Southern Hemisphere differences
(Figs. 9c and 4c).
As in the case of cloud cover, where precipitation
changes are large they are likely signiﬁcant (Fig. 10ccompared with Fig. 4d). For example, in the tropical
FIG. 13. As in Fig. 12, but for (a) the average changes in northward ozone transport and (b) the differences in
northward ozone transport; (c) the average changes in vertical ozone transport and (d) the differences in vertical
ozone transport.1118 JOURNAL OF CLIMATE V OLUME 27western Paciﬁc, in the vicinity of Indonesia, the result
that using higher solar irradiance likely underestimates23CO
2precipitation increases by more than 50%
(0.2 mm day21out of the 0.5 mm day21change) is likely
signiﬁcant since the standard error in the mean pre-cipitation in this region (Fig. 4d) is less than0.05 mm day
21.
Also signiﬁcant are the differences in climate-driven
ozone changes for the two different values of total solar
irradiance, shown in Fig. 11c, especially at high latitudeswhere they are a factor of 4 larger than the standarderrors in the mean shown in Fig. 5b. When simulatingtotal ozone changes for double CO
2concentrations, use
of the higher solar irradiance (1367.0 W m22) instead of
the more accurate lower level (1361.3 W m22) likely
underestimates northern high-latitude total ozone
changes by at least a few Dobson units.
As was done for the 1 3CO 2simulations with two
different solar irradiance values, we also investigate howmuch of the differences between the 2 3CO

are due to the solar irradiance and cloud cover changesdirectly as opposed to atmosphere–ocean interactions.As noted in section 2, we use the same doubled CO

surface temperatures changes in runs 3S and 4S. The
major temperature differences in Fig. 8c, over the
northern North Atlantic and near eastern Antarctica,are not present when the sea ice and sea surface tem-perature changes are the same, nor are the patterns ofprecipitation change (Fig. 10c). These then depend pri-marily on the ocean–atmosphere interaction. The high-latitude sea level pressure and cloud cover changes, incontrast, do maintain some component of the pattern
evident in Figs. 7c and 9c. The explanation for this lies in
the stratospheric ozone response. Most of the features inFigs. 11c, 12, and 13 also appear without the sea surfacetemperature differences between the doubled CO
2
simulations; hence, the inﬂuence on the high-latitude sealevel pressure and cloud cover responses does as well.
6. Discussion and conclusions
The compensation approach that the GISS Model 3
climate model uses to adjust the energy balance fordifferent absolute solar irradiance values essentiallyeliminates the impact of these differences on the modelspeciﬁcations of most climate parameters globally. Dif-ferences in regional climate that the model simulatesusing two different values of solar irradiance, 1367.0 and
1361.3 W m
22, are understandable, repeatable, small, and
typically comparable to the model repeatability de-
rived from the standard deviations of the last 400 yearsin 500-yr runs. In a few areas, for some variables, dif-ferences are more noticeable: for example, tropicalcloud cover, high-latitude temp eratures, regional precip-
itation, and high-latitude stratospheric ozone. Especiallyfor regions away from the extratropical oceans, a numberof these differences do not depend on the atmosphere–ocean interaction.
In the Model 3 simulations of climate change arising
from doubled levels of atmospheric CO
2concentrations
determined using two different solar irradiance values,
regional differences apparent in the climate speciﬁca-
tions are ampliﬁed by the climate change perturbationand, therefore, are of somewhat more consequence.Nevertheless, even here the general patterns of changeare reproduced in both sets of simulations. Noticeableregional differences do appear in some cases for thesame climate features that showed differences in the13CO
2run: tropical cloud cover and precipitation, high-
latitude temperature, and ozone. In the tropics where
cloud cover is higher in the 1 3CO 2run, increases in
precipitation and cloud cover are more muted. Overland where cloud cover is reduced in the 1 3CO
2run,
cloud cover reductions and warming are lessened.Where sea ice is greater in the 1 3CO
2run, so is sea ice
loss and warming. For these climate change experi-ments, where sea surface temperatures and sea ice are
important (tropical precipitation, high-latitude temper-
ature response), the ocean–atmosphere interaction isnecessary; for the stratosphere, high-latitude stabilityand its effect on sea level pressure, it is not.
When using a higher value of solar irradiance, and in
particular of UV irradiance, Model 3 overestimatesozone concentrations at high northern latitudes in the13CO
2simulations. In the doubled CO 2simulations, this
produces slightly warmer stratospheric temperatures,
which reduces photochemical ozone production and(compared with a simulation with the same UV values)results in an underestimate of climate-induced totalozone increases at high northern latitudes. These resultsdo not depend on ocean–atmosphere interactions.
Given the overall uncertainty of climate change sim-
ulations for future CO
2levels, the differences reported
here do not greatly affect our overall conﬁdence (or lack
of it) in the estimated climate changes. Clearly modelsshould use the most accurate solar irradiance valueavailable, which is that measured by TIM on SORCE,but we expect that this will not substantially alter thepredictions of climate change currently being made bypresent-day models. As climate models improve theircloud parameterizations and seek higher ﬁdelity speci-
ﬁcation and forecasts of climate change on smaller re-
gional scales, the requirement for the correct absolutevalue of solar irradiance will likely increase in impor-tance. In particular, we expect that using the lower ratherthan higher value of solar irradiance in present-day1FEBRUARY 2014 R I N D E T A L . 1119coupled chemistry climate models, such as those used
in the recent Scientiﬁc Assessment of Ozone Depletion(WMO 2011), will alter somewhat their projections offuture ozone changes.
While other modeling groups likely use somewhat
different compensation techniques to ensure net radia-tion balance for preindustrial simulations, it is unlikelythat the compensation produced by the GISS procedure
would ‘‘work,’’ while others would not. Nevertheless,
a comparison with other models would be useful, if forno other reason than to highlight differences in such‘‘compensation’’ techniques and how they may propa-gate uncertainties in simulations of future climate.

Abstract. We examine the climate effects of the emissions
of near-term climate forcers (NTCFs) from 4 continental re-gions (East Asia, Europe, North America and South Asia)using results from the Task Force on Hemispheric Transportof Air Pollution Source-Receptor global chemical transport
model simulations. We address 3 aerosol species (sulphate,particulate organic matter and black carbon) and 4 ozone
precursors (methane, reactive nitrogen oxides (NO
x), volatile
organic compounds and carbon monoxide). We calculate theglobal climate metrics: global warming potentials (GWPs)and global temperature change potentials (GTPs). For theaerosols these metrics are simply time-dependent scalings ofthe equilibrium radiative forcings. The GTPs decrease morerapidly with time than the GWPs. The aerosol forcings andhence climate metrics have only a modest dependence onemission region. The metrics for ozone precursors includethe effects on the methane lifetime. The impacts via methaneare particularly important for the 20 yr GTPs. Emissions ofNO
xand VOCs from South Asia have GWPs and GTPs of
higher magnitude than from the other Northern Hemisphereregions.
The analysis is further extended by examining the
temperature-change impacts in 4 latitude bands, and cal-culating absolute regional temperature-change potentials(ARTPs). The latitudinal pattern of the temperature responsedoes not directly follow the pattern of the diagnosed radia-
tive forcing. We ﬁnd that temperatures in the Arctic latitudesappear to be particularly sensitive to BC emissions fromSouth Asia. The northern mid-latitude temperature response
to northern mid-latitude emissions is approximately twice aslarge as the global average response for aerosol emission, andabout 20–30 % larger than the global average for methane,
VOC and CO emissions.
1 Introduction
The emissions of reactive gases and aerosols can inﬂuence
human and ecosystem health by affecting ozone and par-ticulate matter concentrations (HTAP, 2010). They can also
affect climate through the burdens of ozone, methane and
aerosols, having both cooling and warming effects. Becauseof the short lifetimes of aerosols (days), ozone (weeks),methane (a decade), and their precursors, their climate ef-fects are predominantly in the near term (less than 30 yr)
so we refer to these species as “near-term climate forcers
(NTCFs)”. They are also often called short-lived climate pol-lutants (SLCPs).
UNEP and WMO (2011) and Shindell et al. (2012) have
suggested that the mitigation of ozone precursors and black

carbon (BC) would be attractive for both air quality and cli-
mate on a 30-yr timescale, provided it is not at the expenseof CO
2mitigation. Typical air quality policies target both
warming and cooling species and tend to have an overalldetrimental effect on climate (in terms of surface tempera-tures). Therefore, it is important to understand how the ef-fects of NTCFs vary by location of emissions, when air qual-ity policies are considered. This can also be important forclimate policies that affect both short and long-lived species(Berntsen et al., 2006). Many metrics have been proposed tocompare these effects on climate, but here we consider theintegrated radiative forcing (RF) using the global warmingpotential metric (GWP) (IPCC, 1990) and the surface tem-perature change using the global and regional temperature-change metrics (GTP and RTP) (Shine et al., 2005; Shindelland Faluvegi, 2010).
The NTCFs we consider in this paper are sulphate, par-
ticulate organic matter (POM), black carbon (BC), methaneand ozone precursors. Some halogenated species have shortlifetimes and are therefore NTCFs, but we do not consider
those here. NTCFs with lifetimes longer than the interhemi-
spheric mixing time (such as methane) are considered rea-sonably well mixed, with the concentrations and RF patternsindependent of the emission location. Species with shorterlifetimes such as ozone and aerosols have heterogeneous dis-tributions and RF patterns that are dependent on the emis-
sion location (Fuglestvedt et al., 1999; Berntsen et al., 2005;
Naik et al., 2005; Fry et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2013). The sur-face temperature response does not directly follow the spatialdetails of the RF pattern, rather it smoothes out the patternover scales of ˜3500 km in the meridional direction and over12000 km in the zonal direction (Shindell et al., 2010).
The RFs and GWPs for the Task Force on Hemispheric
Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP) Source-Receptor globalchemical transport model (CTM) simulations (HTAP, 2010)were previously documented by Fry et al. (2012) for reac-tive gases, and by Yu et al. (2013) for aerosols. In this studywe have moved further down the chain of climate impacts,
showing how analytical formulae can be used to relate equi-
librium RF values to the evolution of global and latitudinaltemperature changes.
We use the HTAP RF estimates to calculate GWPs in
Sect. 3.1. From these, we derive the global mean surface tem-perature responses as functions of time for emissions of dif-ferent components in different Northern Hemisphere regions,and normalise by the corresponding response for CO
2to de-
rive GTPs in Sect. 3.2. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 follow a similar,but not identical methodology to Fuglestvedt et al. (2010).One difference being that for the ozone precursor reduction
cases, we use experiments with ﬁxed global methane con-
centrations; our calculations are based on RF and changesin methane lifetimes rather than the steady-state atmosphericconcentrations and primary mode time constant that wereused in Fuglestvedt et al. (2010). Then in Sect. 4, we gobeyond looking at global mean values for the response anduse the recently introduced concept of the RTP (Shindell and
Faluvegi, 2010; Shindell et al., 2012) to quantify the impactsof regional pollutant emissions on temperatures in broad lat-
itude bands.
2 Methodology
The basic data needed as input to the GWP and GTP cal-
culations can be derived from the equilibrium RF responsesof chemistry transport models to step changes in emis-sions. Here we use results from the HTAP study (HTAP,2010) in which an ensemble of chemistry transport mod-
els carried out experiments reducing the emissions of (an-thropogenic) ozone or aerosol precursors by 20 % in four
Northern Hemisphere continental regions (North America[NA, 15
◦–55◦N, 60◦W–125◦W], Europe [EU, 25◦–65◦N,
10◦W–50◦E], East Asia [EA, 15◦–50◦N, 95◦–160◦E], and
South Asia [SA, 5◦–35◦N, 50◦–95◦E]). Each ozone precur-
sor was reduced separately in each region. For the aerosolexperiments, all species were reduced together. The effectsof regional ozone precursor emission changes (NO
x, CO,
NMVOCs, methane) on ozone and methane concentrationswere calculated by Fiore et al. (2009). The consequent netRF impacts from an ensemble of 11 of the CTMs were cal-culated by Fry et al. (2012). The changes in RF due to theemissions of SO
2, primary particulate organic matter (POM)
and BC were calculated by Yu et al. (2013) from an ensembleof 9 models.
Because of the time needed for methane to equilibrate to
emissions changes, methane concentrations were ﬁxed glob-ally to 1760 ppb (nmol mol
−1) for all experiments except for
the methane perturbation experiment in which it was reducedby 20 % to 1408 ppb. The impacts of ozone precursor emis-sions on global methane and long-term ozone responses werecalculated analytically from the methane loss by troposphericOH diagnostic reported by each CTM (Fiore et al., 2009; Fryet al., 2012).
Fry et al. (2012) used the NOAA Geophysical Fluid
Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) standalone radiative trans-fer model (GFDL GAMDT, 2004) to calculate the grid-ded, stratospheric-adjusted net radiative ﬂuxes (incoming
shortwave minus outgoing longwave) at steady state due to
changes in methane, ozone, and sulphate aerosol. The 3-Dconcentration ﬁelds were from the multi-model mean alongwith the mean ±1 standard deviation. The radiative transfer
model simulations exclude aerosol-cloud interactions and theinternal mixing of aerosols.
Yu et al. (2013) applied normalised direct RFs (NDRFs)
calculated with the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiationand Transport (GOCART) model (Yu et al., 2004) to theaerosol optical depths (AODs) from each model. The NDRFswere applied on a 2
◦×2.5◦degree grid for each month of
the year for each of the three components (SO 4, POM, BC).
No aerosol-cloud interactions were included and the aerosols

3 Global metrics
3.1 Global warming potentialsGWPs have been the most common way to compare the
relative climate effects of different species. The absoluteglobal warming potential (AGWP) is deﬁned (IPCC, 1990)as the integrated RF over a time horizon Hdue to a 1 kg
pulse emission of a species and has units Wm
−2yr kg−1.

where Ais the speciﬁc
RF (RF per kg atmospheric burden). AGWP is typically nor-
malised by the AGWP for CO 2to give a dimensionless quan-
tity GWP. Here we use the CO 2impulse response function
from the IPCC AR4 (Forster et al., 2007) where the RF from
a pulse of CO 2is given by ACO2/parenleftBigg

[0.217, 0.259, 0.338 and 0.186], and αCO2

timescales [172.9, 18.51, 1.186] years. This gives AGWPsfor CO
2of 2.5 ×10−14and 8.7 ×10−14Wm−2yr kg−1at
time horizons of 20 and 100 yr respectively.
3.1.1 Aerosols
For the aerosol species, the lifetimes are sufﬁciently short
that the atmospheric burdens rapidly reach equilibrium aftera step change in emission. The equilibrium RFs, Fper emis-
sion change Efor each species ( F/E)(e.g. Table 6 of Yu
et al. (2013)), are equal to Aα. Hence, provided that the time
horizon chosen is much longer than the lifetime of the aerosol
(α/lessmuchH), the AGWP is also simply equal to the equilibrium
response to a unit step change in emissions and is indepen-dent of the time horizon. A similar argument was made byBond et al. (2011) where they introduced the speciﬁc forcingpulse (SFP) (units J kg
−1). For short-lived species ( α/lessmuchH)
the global SFP is simply a scaling of the AGWP. We do not
use the SFP concept further in this paper, but it is useful to
illustrate that for short-lived species the AGWP can be con-sidered an effectively instantaneous energy perturbation tothe system.
The AGWP is a measure of the globally-averaged net ra-
diative effect of an emission pulse, but the emissions them-
selves do not need to be globally emitted. Emissions fromdifferent regions have different lifetimes and the speciﬁc RFsmay be regionally dependent. Both of these lead to a depen-dence of AGWP on the emitting region. AGWPs for SO
2,
POM and BC are listed for the 4 HTAP regions in Table 1;
these are the same values as listed in Yu et al. (2013) Ta-
ble 6 with a change of units. AGWPs for SO 2and POM
are negative reﬂecting the cooling impact. The values forEA are slightly smaller than for the other continents due tomore rapid removal of the aerosols and lower oxidation efﬁ-ciency (Koch et al., 2007). Pollutants are typically exportedfrom EA by frontal systems with associated strong precipita-tion (HTAP, 2010). In contrast, BC emissions have positiveAGWPs, and the values for EU are slightly larger than forthe other continents as these absorbing aerosols are advectedover the brighter surfaces of the Arctic. The GWP values canbe derived by normalising by the AGWP
CO2(see above), giv-
ing GWP(100)s of −40±9,−46±20, and 340 ±210 for
SO2, POM and BC, respectively for emissions from “All”
regions. These are of slightly lower magnitude than in Fu-glestvedt et al. (2010), but within the uncertainty ranges.
3.1.2 Methane
The decay time for a methane perturbation is around 12 yr,
hence for time horizons of 20 or 30 yr, the criterion ( α/lessmuchH)
no longer holds. For methane, the HTAP experiments werebased on a global change in the methane concentration

rather than regional emission changes to save running the
chemistry models to equilibrium. Here the direct AGWP is
again given byFCH4
CH4
ECH4(1−exp(−H/slashbig
fαCH4))where FCH4
CH4is
the methane forcing diagnosed from the methane changeexperiment using the formula from Table 3 of Myhre etal. (1998). The factor faccounts for the effect of methane
on its own lifetime (Prather et al., 1996). The impliedemissions necessary to cause this change in concentra-
tion are given by E
CH4=/Delta1BCH4/fαCH4where /Delta1BCH4is
the change in methane burden. In the HTAP methane per-turbation experiment (SR2) where methane was decreasedby 20 % from 1760 ppb to 1408 ppb, /Delta1B
CH4= 979 Tg,
αCH4= 8.7±1.3 yr, f= 1.34 ±0.05 (Fiore et al., 2009) giv-
ing an implied emission of −84 Tg yr−1. Methane is an
ozone precursor, it affects the oxidation rate of SO 2to sul-
phate aerosol, and it generates water vapour (only impor-tant in the stratosphere). The two indirect forcings due to
changes in ozone FO3

3.1.3 Ozone precursors
Ozone precursors (CO, VOCs and NO x) have a short-term
impact on RF by generating ozone and perturbing sulphateoxidation; they also have a longer-term impact by chang-ing the methane lifetime. The short-term impacts on ozone

AGWPs for the short-lived components are then simply
(FO3

ﬁxed in these experiments, the longer-term impacts onmethane can be diagnosed from the change in the ﬂuxesthrough the CH
4+OH reaction in the models. Changes in
methane lifetime /Delta1αCH4

agnostics. If the methane concentrations had not been ﬁxedthe methane burden would have responded to the changesin lifetime moving towards a new equilibrium burden of/parenleftBig

sors were presented by Fry et al. (2012), their Table S2.
3.2 Global temperature-change potentials
The GTP metric (Shine et al., 2005) is more closely re-
lated to observable climate impacts than the GWP, as it iscalculated from temperature changes. The absolute globaltemperature-change potential (AGTP) is given by the surfacetemperature response following an instantaneous pulse emis-sion. The global surface temperature responds to changes in
the RF at the tropopause on a spectrum of timescales. We
follow the same methodology in Fuglestvedt et al. (2010)and use a temperature response function that is the sum of
two exponentials R(t)=

where the coefﬁ-

we use c 1= 0.631 K(Wm−2)−1), c 2= 0.429 K(Wm−2)−1),
d1= 8.4 yr, d 2= 409.5 yr, giving an equilibrium climate sensi-
tivity of 1.060 K(Wm−2)−1) (3.9 K for CO 2doubling). The
GTPs are constructed by normalising by the correspondingAGTP for CO
2. For this we use the expression in Fuglestvedt

3.2.1 Aerosols
For aerosols with lifetimes much less than the time horizons
of interest and the shortest climate timescale ( α/lessmuchH,α/lessmuchd1)
the AGTP is simply a scaling of the temperature responsefunction by the equilibrium forcing from a unit step change

Table 2. GTPs at 20 and 100 yr time horizons for the HTAP aerosols (or precursors), methane and non-methane ozone precursors. Data are
given for emissions from the 4 HTAP continents separately and combined. For methane only a global number is given. Uncertainties are inter-model differences in the CTM responses to emission perturbations from Yu et al. (2013) and Fry et al. (2012). This includes uncertainties inthe aerosol and ozone responses, and in the methane lifetime response. Note these values exclude the effects of aerosol cloud interactions,the effect of BC deposition on snow albedo, changes in ozone above the tropopause and carbon-cycle interactions as described in Sect. 5.

are listed in Table 2. The patterns are also the same as for the
AGWPs in Table 1 and the forcing efﬁciencies in Table 6 ofYu et al. (2013).
3.2.2 Methane
For methane, the interactions between the methane lifetime
and the climate response timescales become important. Com-bining the expression for the methane AGWP with equationA4 from Fuglestvedt et al. (2010) we get for the total AGTP:

The GTPCH4for 20 and 100 yr are shown in Fig. 2 and are
listed in Table 2. The decrease in GTP between 20 and 100 yris a factor of 15, much larger than for the aerosols, This is be-cause the AGTP
CH4has not dropped off as quickly by year20 as it did for the aerosols. The dominant contribution to the
GTPCH4uncertainty comes from the inter-model variability
in the methane lifetime in the control run ( αCH4). The di-
rect methane contribution to the GTP(20) and GTP(100) arein agreement with Boucher et al. (2009), however the ozonecontribution is slightly lower here as discussed in Sect. 5.1.
3.2.3 Ozone precursors
The AGTPs for the other ozone precursor species can be cal-
culated by combining the equilibrium responses with the ef-
fects on the methane lifetime to obtain an analogous expres-
sion to the AGWP:
AGTPi(H)=1
Ei/parenleftBig
FO3
i+FSO4

R(H) +χiAGTPCH4(H) (5)
The time evolution of the total AGTPs therefore depends on
the relative balance between the short and long-term compo-nents, i.e. the almost instantaneous change in ozone and thedecadal timescale for changes in methane. Figure 3 showsthe GTP for NO
x, NMVOC and CO emissions (summed over
the 4 continents). For NO xemissions the long-term compo-
nent acts in the opposite sense to the short-term because NO x
emissions produce ozone, but decrease methane ( χiis neg-
ative). The AGTP starts positive, but becomes negative af-ter 10 yr. For NMVOC and CO emissions the short-term andlong-term components have the same sign (as they increaseboth ozone and methane), with the long-term component be-ing relatively more important for CO. In all cases, the GTPis dominated by the long-term component from about 30 yr

are of similar magnitudes, although both are very small. Theresults of this can be seen in the bar charts of Fig. 4 and val-ues listed in Table 2 which break the GTPs down by emissionspecies and emission region. The net NO
xGTPs are negative
with the largest impact coming from emissions in SA, andthe least impact from EU. For VOCs the largest impact is alsofrom SA. The tropics are the region of greatest methane oxi-dation, so NO
xand VOC emissions from SA have the largest
impact on methane. CO has a sufﬁciently long lifetime that
it can be advected away from the source continent; hence,the climate impact is largely independent of emission region.The fractional contribution to the GTP from the methane re-sponse is greater for the 20 yr time horizon than the 100 yrhorizon. Although counterintuitive, the short-term contribu-tions have already fallen rapidly by the 20 yr horizon andthe curves (Fig. 3) begin to ﬂatten (decreases of a factor of7 between 20 and 100 yr), whereas for the long-term con-tributions (driven by methane changes) the 20 yr horizon isroughly in the steepest portion of the curve, declining there-after by a factor of 15 by the 100 yr horizon.

4 Regional climate change
Shindell and Faluvegi (2009), Shindell and Faluvegi (2010)
and Shindell (2012) introduced the idea of the absolute re-gional temperature-change potential (ARTP) to quantify re-gional climate change from heterogeneous forcing patterns.There is not a one-to-one correspondence between the forc-ing in a region and the local temperature response, as thereare RF contributions from outside the regions due to thetransport of heat. Shindell and Faluvegi (2009) showed thatthe forcing-temperature relationship could be characterisedusing 4 broad latitude bands: southern mid-high latitudes(90
◦S–28◦S), tropics (28◦S–28◦N), northern mid-latitudes
(28◦N–60◦N), and the Arctic (60◦N–90◦N). Thus the ex-
pression for the AGTP can be generalised as:

theklmappropriate for the species except for responses to
forcing in the 28◦S–90◦S band which was only derived for
CO2by Shindell and Faluvegi (2009). The coefﬁcients used
for BC and O 3are taken from Table 3, normalising by the
climate sensitivity. We assume that the temperature responsefunction Rapplies equally to temperature changes in each
region. As discussed in Shindell and Faluvegi (2010), in thedifferent latitude bands encompassing such diverse regions
as the Arctic and the tropics, the partitioning between the
fast and slow responses and even the time constants of theseresponses may vary from the global average. There is no datacurrently available to break this down further, although Shin-dell (2012) suggests that the land response might be 20 %
larger than the average of land and ocean.

form as the AGTPs with the magnitudes given by the prod-uct of the response coefﬁcients with the forcing pattern. Thetemperature change in latitude band mdue to the emission ofspecies i:

where Fiis the equilibrium globally-average forcing as be-

itudinal patterns of the ARTPs for aerosols do not vary withtime. Figure 5 shows the normalised equilibrium forcing pat-terns ( F
i,l/Ei) and the ARTPi
m(20) values for the 3 aerosol
species. Note that for the scattering aerosols (SO 2and POM
emissions) the largest RF is in the latitude band closest to theemitting region (28
◦N–60◦N for EA, EU and NA emissions,
28◦S–28◦N for SA emissions). There seems to be very lit-
tle RF from scattering aerosols over the bright Arctic lati-
tudes as there is less contrast between the brightness of theaerosol and the underlying albedo. For the absorbing aerosol(BC), due to the high contrast, the RF is high over the Arc-tic latitudes, and for EU emissions the Arctic RF exceedsthat of the northern mid-latitudes. Applying the matrix of re-
sponse coefﬁcients smoothes out the impacts such that there
is less latitudinal variation in the temperature responses thanin the RFs. The Arctic temperatures are particularly sensitiveto forcing changes in the northern mid-latitudes (at least inthe coefﬁcient set used here), where the Arctic responses tothe scattering aerosols are comparable to the northern mid-
latitude responses.
For BC the Arctic shows a lower surface temperature re-
sponse than would be expected from the RF pattern. This isbecause for BC the k
lmare negative for the Arctic response
to Arctic forcing (see Table 3), i.e. a positive RF over theArctic due to changes in atmospheric BC has a cooling ef-fect on Arctic temperatures (ﬁgure 1d of Shindell and Falu-vegi 2009). This relationship, while surprising, has been con-ﬁrmed by other studies (Sand et al., 2013; Flanner, 2013) andis caused primarily by a decrease in the meridional heat trans-port. The Arctic cooling effect only applies to BC changes
in the mid to upper Arctic troposphere, such as found here
following advection from northern mid-latitude and tropicalsources. Local Arctic emission of BC has a warming effect,as does deposition of BC on to Arctic snow from any sourceregion (Flanner, 2013). The net effect on the Arctic of BCemissions is still warming from each of the HTAP regionssince RF changes in the northern mid-latitudes and tropicshave a large positive impact on Arctic temperatures by in-creasing the meridional heat transport. In fact in this studyBC emissions from SA have the largest impact on Arctictemperatures since they exert a strong RF over the tropicsand northern mid-latitudes and little over the Arctic. The re-
sponses in the Arctic to BC emissions might be expected to
be more sensitive to the more northerly source regions if BCdeposition to snow were accounted for.
The ARTP(20) values are shown, but the latitudinal pat-
terns will be identical for any time horizon, albeit with dif-ferent overall scaling. The aerosol impacts on the northern

These are slightly larger than the calculated AGTPs inthe previous section, which implicitly used global averagedclimate sensitivity. This difference can be considered as anefﬁcacy larger than unity due to the forcing being concen-trated at the higher northern latitudes where the climate re-sponse is stronger.4.2 Methane

extra-tropics as this region is less sensitive to RF changesoutside these latitudes. As for the aerosols, the latitudinal pat-

negative (reduced methane) so the net forcing is the differ-
ence between short and long-term components. The net forc-
ings are negative in the Southern Hemisphere and tropicswhere methane destruction outweighs the ozone production,but positive in the northern mid and high latitudes (exceptfor SA emissions which have negative forcing in the north-
ern high latitudes). For NMVOC and CO emissions, the χ

components add. When adding the smoother methane terms,the latitudinal distributions for the total forcing become moreeven than for the short-term components. For CO, the highestforcing is in the tropics for all emission regions.
The corresponding ARTPs are shown in Fig. 8. For the
ARTP(20)s, the long-term component is more importantthan the short-term component and the ARTPs for the non-methane ozone precursors look similar to the methane ARTP,with an opposite sign for NO
xemissions. The highest re-
sponse is in the northern mid-latitudes for VOCs and CO. For
the ARTP(100) the contributions of the short and long-term
components are more balanced. For NO xthe ARTP(100)s are
close to zero in the northern mid-latitudes for emissions fromEA and NA reﬂecting the warming from ozone balancing thecooling from decreased methane.
All the results from HTAP were based on changing North-
ern Hemisphere emissions. We do not have results fromSouthern Hemisphere experiments, but might expect the
forcing and temperature responses to be stronger in the hemi-sphere in to which the species are emitted.
5 Limitations and uncertainties
We acknowledge limitations to this study in this section,
most importantly the neglect of the aerosol-cloud interac-tions. As a consequence, care must be taken in using someof the numerical values presented in Table 2.
5.1 Changes in stratospheric ozone
As previously discussed in Fry et al. (2012) the ozone forc-
ing here only includes ozone changes below the tropopause.Søvde et al. (2012) calculate a forcing contribution fromozone responses above the tropopause of 15 % of the total.Adding this would take the ozone contribution to the methanemetrics to 24 % of the direct methane effect. This ends up be-ing a similar value to the 25 ±15 % often used (e.g. Forster et
al., 2007) which came originally from the troposphere-only
responses of a mixture of 2-D and 3-D models discussed in
chapter 2 of IPCC (1994).
5.2 Aerosol interactions with clouds and snow albedo
The responses to aerosol emission changes were calculated
using chemical transport models that omit interactions withclouds, so the RFs presented here only include direct effectsbased on the aerosol column loadings (Yu et al., 2013). Theindirect effects of aerosols are likely to be as great as the

direct effect for hydrophilic aerosols (sulphate and POM in
this study) and may also be important for BC. The indirecteffects are likely to vary with emission region depending ontheir proximity to stratiform clouds and the regional aerosolloading. The impact of BC deposition on snow albedo is alsovery uncertain. Bond et al. (2011) estimate that it adds about20 % to the RF for BC emissions from NA, EU and SA,and about 10 % for EA emissions. This might be expected topreferentially increase the temperature responses in the Arc-
tic latitudes.
5.3 Nitrate aerosols
NO
xemissions have an additional cooling effect by generat-
ing ammonium nitrate aerosols in regions of high ammoniaabundance. Unfortunately, nitrate aerosols were not includedin many of the HTAP simulations, but we can use the resultsof Bauer et al. (2007) who calculated a normalised direct RFfrom global anthropogenic NO
xemissions of -2.0 ×10−12
Wm−2kg−1. This would add −25 and −3.3 to the “All” NO x
GTP(20) and (100) and ( −62 and −2.2 in Table 2), making
these consistently negative.
5.4 CO 2from methane oxidation
Methane is oxidised in the atmosphere, with a molar frac-
tionεof between 0.5 and 1.0 resulting in CO 2(Boucher
et al., 2009). This provides an emission of CO 2equal to
ε×(44/16) ×[CH 4]/αCH4which has its own climate impact
(the factor 44/16 converts from a molar fraction to a massfraction). Thus the addition to the methane GTP is:

AGTPCO2(H−t)dt
The methane oxidation adds 1.3 ±0.4 and 2.1 ±0.7 to
the GTP(20) and GTP(100) respectively as in Boucher etal. (2009). Note that for non-fossil methane this extra CO
2
is still produced as described above, but should be compen-
sated for by previous uptake of CO 2. Thus the above cor-
rection should not be applied to non-fossil methane withoutalso accounting for the uptake, requiring detailed life-cycleanalysis (for instance of the production of cattle fodder).
5.5 Carbon cycle effects
Changes to the atmospheric composition of gases and
aerosols can also affect the carbon cycle thus adding further
indirect climate impacts (e.g. Sitch et al., 2007). Collins et
al. (2010) showed that adding in the effects of surface ozoneon vegetation damage and reduced uptake of CO
2added
about 10 % to the methane GTP(20) and could change thesign of the NO
xGTPs. Hence the sign of the net impact of
NOxemissions is still uncertain.
The temperature changes calculated in the GTPs can also
lead to an impact on the carbon cycle, for instance throughincreased soil respiration. The above calculations of GWPand GTP for species ias ratios AGWP
i/AGWPCO2and
AGTPi/AGTPCO2treat this inconsistently (as do many other

studies, e.g. Forster et al., 2007). The temperature-carbon
cycle feedback is implicitly included in the response func-tion used for CO
2(Joos et al., 2001) and hence in the
denominator AGTPCO2, but is excluded in the numerator
AGTPi. Gillett and Matthews (2010) and Saroﬁm (2012)
using carbon cycle models ﬁnd that this can underestimatethe GTPs for methane by 20 %. A way of obtaining a sim-ple estimate of this effect is to make the crude assumption
that the change in the land-atmosphere ﬂux of CO
2is lin-
early proportionally to the surface temperature change witha coefﬁcient /Gamma1. Multi-model comparisons of carbon cycle
models (Friedlingstein et al., 2006; Arora et al., 2013) sug-gest a change in the land and ocean uptake of approximately−1G t C y r
−1per K temperature change. We therefore use
a/Gamma1of+(44/12) ×1012kg(CO 2)y r−1K−1. We associate an
uncertainty of 100 % with this to reﬂect a range from no ef-fect to twice what we have quoted. Treating the decreaseduptake as an extra CO

tion to the AGTP due to the climate-carbon cycle feedbackof:

Note that because the AGTPCO2does include the climate
feedback we do not need to iterate this calculation any fur-
ther. The contributions to the methane GTP from methaneoxidation and climate-carbon cycle feedback are illustratedin Fig. 9 along with the direct methane impact (i.e. exclud-ing ozone, sulphate and stratospheric water vapour). Theclimate-carbon cycle feedback effects are potentially large
adding 1.7 ±1.7 and 4.3 ±4.3 to the methane GTPs at 20 and
100 yr (55 and 3.6 in Table 2). Note that the climate-carbon
cycle feedback will also affect GWPs too, adding 4.5 ±4.5
to the methane GWP(100) value (24.2 in Fry et al., 2012).For aerosols and the short-term component of ozone precur-sors this climate-carbon cycle feedback could add 17 % and170 % to the 20 and 100 yr GTPs and 4 % and 20 % to the20 and 100 yr GWPs. The CO
2impacts are more important
over longer timescales as they persist for considerably longerthan the direct effects, since CO
2continues to be released for
some time after the pulse of the original emitted species hasdecayed.
5.6 Temperature response
One major uncertainty is in the assumptions about the tem-
perature response, both the timescales of the temperature re-sponse function Rand the latitudinal patterns included in the
k
lm. Olii ´e and Peters (2012) explore the sensitivity of GTP
to model spread in Rand ﬁnd that uncertainties increase
with time horizon and decrease with lifetime. For GTPCH4an
uncertainty of −12/+10 % was found for a 20 yr time hori-
zon, which increased to −77/+75 % for a time horizon of
100 yr (for 5th–95th percentiles). Higher uncertainty rangeswere calculated for short-lived species such as aerosols; for20 yr time horizon these were −59/+85 % and −88/+80 %
for 100 yr.
6 Conclusions
We have examined the climate impacts of aerosols and reac-
tive gases, characterising them using metrics to inform policymakers of the relative importance of the different species, thedependence of impacts on emissions location, and the poten-tial impacts of control policies. The analytical formulae con-
structed here could be used to calculate metrics for similar
experiments in the literature (or yet to be performed) that re-port RFs and methane lifetime changes.
For the aerosol species the chain from RF to GWP to GTP
adds little extra information on the relative differences sincethey are simply scalings of each other. Hence the relative
global importance of emissions of different species from dif-ferent regions remains unchanged from Yu et al. (2013). Theinter-model variability is larger than the variability betweenemission regions, suggesting that a single metric averagedover all emitting regions would be a usable approximation.The small differences between regions that are suggested area lower climate impact for the emission of SO
2and POM
from East Asia, and a higher climate impact for the emissionof BC from Europe.
We calculate GTP

and 100 yr after including a correction for the expected in-creases in lower stratospheric ozone. Adding in the effects of

climate-carbon cycle feedbacks and CO 2from methane oxi-
dation would increase these to 59 ±9 and 10.1 ±4.5.
For ozone precursors, the relative importance of the short
and long-term components varies with the time horizon used.This is most noticeable for NO
xemissions where the short
and long-term components act in opposite directions so theGTP
NOxs are dominated by the negative methane component
on the 20 yr timescale, but after 100 yr the ozone compo-nent plays a more signiﬁcant role. As with the GWPs (Fryet al., 2012), the GTPs for the ozone precursors are largelyindependent of source region for emissions in the north-ern mid-latitudes, with larger magnitudes for NO
xand VOC
emissions from the more tropical SA region due to more ac-tive photochemistry.
The different patterns of responses when moving down the
impact chain become more apparent when breaking downthe temperature changes into latitude bands. There is no di-
rect relationship between the RF in a region and the surfacetemperature change in that region. Even when using broadlatitude bands, there are contributions to the surface tem-
perature from RF outside the region, although that contribu-
tion decreases with latitudinal distance. Thus, the latitudinaltemperature patterns can differ signiﬁcantly from the globalmean, and also from the latitudinal forcing patterns.
The RF from sulphate and POM aerosols peaks strongly
over the latitudes of the emissions, and so the northern mid-
latitude temperature response to northern mid-latitude emis-
sions is approximately twice as large as the global average.For BC there is a large RF component over the Arctic; how-ever this leads to a cooling of the Artic surface. Thereforethe Arctic temperatures are most sensitive to emissions fromSA since a larger proportion of BC emitted from the other
more northerly regions is advected to the Arctic upper tropo-sphere. This excludes the effects on Artic temperatures ex-
pected from BC deposition to snow which might increasethe importance of the more northerly emission regions on theArctic.
The RFs and RTPs for CH
4, VOC and CO emissions show
smoother latitudinal proﬁles than for the aerosols with a typ-
ically 20–30 % greater temperature response in the northernmid-latitudes than the global average. NO
xemissions from
the Northern Hemisphere source regions lead to negative RFsin the Southern Hemisphere and the tropics and positive RFs
in the northern mid-high latitudes. The resulting temperaturechanges however are cooling in all latitudes, with the excep-tions of northern mid-latitude responses to EA and NA emis-sions on the 100 yr timescale (although the 100 yr responsesare extremely small).
The ﬁndings in this paper begin to address important pol-
icy questions of whether emissions controls within a region
have a larger climate effect in that region, and whether NTCFmitigation controls can be optimised for their impacts on vul-nerable regions such as the Arctic.Acknowledgements. This work was funded under the EU

Climate forcing growth rates: doubling
down on our Faustian bargain
James Hansen,
Pushker Kharecha andMakiko Sato
Goddard Institute for Space
Studies and Columbia EarthInstitute, 2880 Broadway,New York, NY 10025, USAjames.e.hansen@nasa.govRahmstorf et al ’s (2012 ) conclusion that observed climate change is comparable
to projections, and in some cases exceeds projections, allows further inferences ifwe can quantify changing climate forcings and compare those with projections.The largest climate forcing is caused by well-mixed long-lived greenhouse gases.Here we illustrate trends of these gases and their climate forcings, and we discussimplications. We focus on quantities that are accurately measured, and we includecomparison with ﬁxed scenarios, which helps reduce common misimpressionsabout how climate forcings are changing.
Annual fossil fuel CO
2emissions have shot up in the past decade at about
3% yr−1, double the rate of the prior three decades (ﬁgure 1). The growth rate
falls above the range of the IPCC ( 2001 ) ‘Marker’ scenarios, although emissions
are still within the entire range considered by the IPCC SRES ( 2000 ). The surge
in emissions is due to increased coal use (blue curve in ﬁgure 1), which now
accounts for more than 40% of fossil fuel CO 2emissions.
The resulting annual increase of atmospheric CO 2(12-month running mean)
has grown from less than 1 ppm yr−1in the early 1960s to an average
∼2 ppm yr−1in the past decade (ﬁgure 2). Although CO 2measurements were not
made at sufﬁcient locations prior to the early 1980s to calculate the global meanchange, the close match of global and Mauna Loa data for later years suggeststhat Mauna Loa data provide a good approximation of global change (ﬁgure 2),
thus allowing a useful estimate of annual global change beginning with theinitiation of Mauna Loa measurements in 1958 by Keeling et al (1973 ).
Interannual variability of CO
2growth is correlated with ENSO (El Nino
Southern Oscillation) variations of tropical temperatures (ﬁgure 2).
Ocean–atmosphere CO 2exchange is affected by ENSO (Chavez et al 1999 ), but
ENSO seems to have a greater impact on atmospheric CO 2via the terrestrial
carbon cycle through effects on the water cycle, temperature, and ﬁre, asdiscussed in a large body of literature (referenced, e.g., by Schwalm et al 2011 ).
In addition, volcanoes, such as the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, slow theincrease of atmospheric CO
2(Rothenberg et al 2012 ), at least in part because
photosynthesis is enhanced by the increased proportion of diffuse sunlight (Guet al 2003 , Mercado et al 2009 ). Watson ( 1997 ) suggests that volcanic dust
deposited on the ocean surface may also contribute to CO
2uptake by increasing
ocean productivity.
An important question is whether ocean and terrestrial carbon sinks will tend
to saturate as human-made CO 2emissions continue. Piao et al (2008 ) and Zhao
and Running ( 2010 ) suggest that there already may be a reduction of terrestrial
carbon uptake, while Le Qu ´er´eet al (2007 ) and Schuster and Watson ( 2007 ) ﬁnd
evidence of decreased carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean and North AtlanticOcean, respectively. However, others (Knorr 2009 , Sarmiento et al 2010 ,

Ballantyne et al 2012 ) either cast doubt on the reality of a reduced uptake
strength or ﬁnd evidence for increased uptake.
An informative presentation of CO 2observations is the ratio of annual CO 2
increase in the air divided by annual fossil fuel CO 2emissions (Keeling et al
1973 ), the ‘airborne fraction’ (ﬁgure 3, right scale). An alternative deﬁnition of
airborne fraction includes in the denominator of this ratio an estimated netanthropogenic CO
2source from changes in land use, but this latter term is much
more uncertain than the two terms involved in the Keeling et al (1973 ) deﬁnition.
For example, analysis by Harris et al (2012 ) reveals a range as high as a factor of
2–4 in estimates of recent land use emissions; see also the discussion bySarmiento et al (2010 ). However, note that the airborne fraction becomes smaller
when estimated land use emissions are included, with the uptake fraction (oneminus airborne fraction) typically greater than 0.5.

Figure 3. Fossil fuel CO 2emissions (left scale) and airborne fraction, i.e., the ratio of observed
atmospheric CO 2increase to fossil fuel CO 2emissions. Final three points are 5-, 3- and 1-year means.
The simple Keeling airborne fraction, clearly, is not increasing (ﬁgure 3). Thus
the net ocean plus terrestrial sink for carbon emissions has increased by a factorof 3–4 since 1958, accommodating the emissions increase by that factor.
Remarkably, and we will argue importantly, the airborne fraction has declined
since 2000 (ﬁgure 3) during a period without any large volcanic eruptions. The
7-year running mean of the airborne fraction had remained close to 60% up to2000, except for the period affected by Pinatubo. The airborne fraction is affectedby factors other than the efﬁciency of carbon sinks, most notably by changes inthe rate of fossil fuel emissions (Gloor et al 2010 ). However, it is the dependence
of the airborne fraction on fossil fuel emission rate that makes the post-2000downturn of the airborne fraction particularly striking. The change of emissionrate in 2000 from 1 .5% yr
−1to 3 .1% yr−1(ﬁgure 1), other things being equal,
would have caused a sharp increase of the airborne fraction (the simple reasonbeing that a rapid source increase provides less time for carbon to be moveddownward out of the ocean’s upper layers).
A decrease in land use emissions during the past decade (Harris et al 2012 )
could contribute to the decreasing airborne fraction in ﬁgure 3, although Malhi
(2010 ) presents evidence that tropical forest deforestation and regrowth are
approximately in balance, within uncertainties. Land use change can be only apartial explanation for the decrease of the airborne fraction; something more thanland use change seems to be occurring.
We suggest that the huge post-2000 increase of uptake by the carbon sinks
implied by ﬁgure 3is related to the simultaneous sharp increase in coal use
(ﬁgure 1). Increased coal use occurred primarily in China and India (Boden et al
2012 ;B P 2012 ; see graphs at www.columbia.edu/ ∼mhs119/Emissions/Emis
moreFigs/ ). Satellite radiance measurements for July–December, months when
desert dust does not dominate aerosol amount, yield an increase of aerosol opticaldepth in East Asia of about 4% yr
−1during 2000–2006 (van Donkelaar et al
2008 ). Associated gaseous and particulate emissions increased rapidly after 2000
in China and India (Lu et al 2011 , Tian et al 2010 ). Some decrease of the sulfur
component of emissions occurred in China after 2006 as wide application ofﬂue-gas desulfurization began to be initiated (Lu et al 2010 ), but this was largely
offset by continuing emission increases from India (Lu et al 2011 ).
We suggest that the surge of fossil fuel use, mainly coal, since 2000 is a basic
cause of the large increase of carbon uptake by the combined terrestrial and oceancarbon sinks. One mechanism by which fossil fuel emissions increase carbonuptake is by fertilizing the biosphere via provision of nutrients essential for tissuebuilding, especially nitrogen, which plays a critical role in controlling net primaryproductivity and is limited in many ecosystems (Gruber and Galloway 2008 ).
Modeling (e.g., Thornton et al 2009 ) and ﬁeld studies (Magnani et al 2007 )

Figure 4. Observed atmospheric CH 4amount and scenarios for twenty ﬁrst century. Alternative
scenario (Hansen et al 2000 , Hansen and Sato 2004 ) yields maximum global warming ∼1.5◦C above

conﬁrm a major role of nitrogen deposition, working in concert with CO 2
fertilization, in causing a large increase in net primary productivity of temperate
and boreal forests. Sulfate aerosols from coal burning also might increase carbonuptake by increasing the proportion of diffuse insolation, as noted above forPinatubo aerosols, even though the total solar radiation reaching the surface isreduced.
Thus we see the decreased CO
2airborne fraction since 2000 as sharing some
of the same causes as the decreased airborne fraction after the Pinatubo eruption(ﬁgure 3). CO
2fertilization is likely the major effect, as a plausible addition of
5 TgN yr−1from fossil fuels and net ecosystem productivity of 200 kgC kgN−1
(Magnani et al 2007 ,2008 ) yields an annual carbon drawdown of 1 GtC yr−1,
which is of the order of what is needed to explain the post-2000 anomaly inairborne CO
2. However, an aerosol-induced increase of diffuse radiation might
also contribute. Although tropospheric aerosol properties are not accuratelymonitored, there are suggestions of an upward trend of stratospheric backgroundaerosols since 2000 (Hofmann et al 2009 , Solomon et al 2011 ), which could be a
consequence of more tropospheric aerosols at low latitudes where injection oftropospheric air into the stratosphere occurs (Holton et al 1995 ). We discuss
climate implications of the reduced CO
2airborne fraction after presenting data
for other greenhouse gases.
Atmospheric CH 4is increasing more slowly than in IPCC scenarios (ﬁgure 4),
which were deﬁned more than a decade ago (IPCC 2001 ). However, after
remaining nearly constant for several years, CH 4has increased during the past
ﬁve years, pushing slightly above the level that was envisaged in the AlternativeScenario of Hansen et al (2000 ). Reduction of CH
4, besides slowdown in CO 2
growth in the twenty ﬁrst century and a decline of CO 2in the twenty second
century, is a principal requirement to achieve a low climate forcing that stabilizesclimate, in part because CH
4also affects tropospheric ozone and stratospheric
water vapor. The Alternative Scenario, deﬁned in detail by Hansen and Sato(2004 ), keeps maximum global warming at ∼1.5
◦C relative to 1880–1920, under
the assumption that fast-feedback climate sensitivity is ∼3◦C for doubled CO 2
(Hansen et al 2007 ). The Alternative Scenario allows CO 2to reach 475 ppm in
2100 before declining slowly; this scenario assumes that reductions of non-CO 2
greenhouse gases and black carbon aerosols can be achieved sufﬁcient to balancethe warming effect of likely future decreases of reﬂective aerosols.
There are anthropogenic sources of CH
4that potentially could be reduced,
indeed, the leveling off of CH 4amount during the past 20 years seems to have

update of ﬁgure 4 of Hansen and Sato ( 2004 ). Forcing calculations use equations of Hansen et al

gas results equally and thus do not alter the conclusion that the actual forcing falls below that of the
IPCC scenarios.
been caused by decreased venting in oil ﬁelds (Simpson et al 2012 ), but the
feasibility of overall CH 4reduction also depends on limiting global warming
itself, because of the potential for amplifying climate-CH 4feedbacks (Archer
et al 2009 , Koven et al 2011 ). Furthermore, reduction of atmospheric CH 4might
become problematic if unconventional mining of gas, such as ‘hydro-fracking’,expands widely (Cipolla 2009 ), as discussed further below.
The growth rate for the total climate forcing by well-mixed greenhouse gases
has remained below the peak values reached in the 1970s and early 1980s, hasbeen relatively stable for about 20 years, and is falling below IPCC ( 2001 )
scenarios (ﬁgure 5). However, the greenhouse gas forcing is growing faster than
in the Alternative Scenario. MPTGs and OTGs in ﬁgure 5are Montreal Protocol
Trace Gases and Other Trace Gases (Hansen and Sato 2004 ).
If greenhouse gases were the only climate forcing, we would be tempted to
infer from Rahmstorf’s conclusion (that actual climate change has exceededIPCC projections) and our conclusion (that actual greenhouse gas forcings areslightly smaller than IPCC scenarios) that actual climate sensitivity is on the highside of what has generally been assumed. Although that may be a valid inference,the evidence is weakened by the fact that other climate forcings are not negligiblein comparison to the greenhouse gases and must be accounted for.
Natural forcings, by changing solar irradiance and volcanic aerosols, are
well-measured since the late 1970s and included in most IPCC ( 2007 ) climate
simulations. The difﬁculty is human-made aerosols. Aerosols are readily detectedin satellite observations, but determination of their climate forcing requiresaccurate knowledge of changes in aerosol amount, size distribution, absorptionand vertical distribution on a global basis—as well as simultaneous data onchanges in cloud properties to allow inference of the indirect aerosol forcing viainduced cloud changes. Unfortunately, the ﬁrst satellite mission capable ofmeasuring the needed aerosol characteristics (Aerosol Polarimetry Sensor on theGlory satellite, (Mishchenko et al 2007 )) suffered a launch failure and as yet there
are no concrete plans for a replacement mission.
The human-made aerosol climate forcing thus remains uncertain. IPCC ( 2007 )
concludes that aerosols are a negative (cooling) forcing, probably between −0.5
and−2.5Wm
−2. Hansen et al (2011 ), based mainly on analysis of Earth’s
energy imbalance, derive an aerosol forcing −1.6±0.3Wm−2, consistent with
an analysis of Murphy et al (2009 ) that suggests an aerosol forcing about
−1.5Wm−2(see discussion in Hansen et al (2011 )). This large negative aerosol
forcing reduces the net climate forcing of the past century by about half (IPCC2007 ; ﬁgure 1 of Hansen et al 2011 ). Coincidentally, this leaves net climate
forcing comparable to the CO
2forcing alone.

Figure 6. Fossil fuel CO 2emissions and carbon content (1 ppm atmospheric CO 2∼2.12 GtC).
Historical emissions are from Boden et al (2012 ). Estimated reserves and potentially recoverable
resources are based on energy content values of Energy Information Administration (EIA 2011 ),
German Advisory Council (GAC 2011 ), and Global Energy Assessment (GEA 2012 ). We convert
energy content to carbon content using emission factors of Table 4.2 of IPCC ( 2007 ) for coal, gas, and
conventional oil, and, following IPCC, we use an emission factor of unconventional oil the same as thatfor coal.
Reduction of the net human-made climate forcing by aerosols has been
described as a ‘Faustian bargain’ (Hansen and Lacis 1990 , Hansen 2009 ), because
the aerosols constitute deleterious particulate air pollution. Reduction of the netclimate forcing by half will continue only if we allow air pollution to build up togreater and greater amounts. More likely, humanity will demand and achieve areduction of particulate air pollution, whereupon, because the CO
2from fossil
fuel burning remains in the surface climate system for millennia, the ‘devil’spayment’ will be extracted from humanity via increased global warming.
So is the new data we present here good news or bad news, and how does it
alter the ‘Faustian bargain’? At ﬁrst glance there seems to be some good news.First, if our interpretation of the data is correct, the surge of fossil fuel emissions,especially from coal burning, along with the increasing atmospheric CO
2level is
‘fertilizing’ the biosphere, and thus limiting the growth of atmospheric CO 2.
Also, despite the absence of accurate global aerosol measurements, it seems thatthe aerosol cooling effect is probably increasing based on evidence of aerosolincreases in the Far East and increasing ‘background’ stratospheric aerosols.
Both effects work to limit global warming and thus help explain why the rate
of global warming seems to be less this decade than it has been during the priorquarter century. This data interpretation also helps explain why multiple warningsthat some carbon sinks are ‘drying up’ and could even become carbon sources,e.g., boreal forests infested by pine bark beetles (Kurz et al 2008 ) and the
Amazon rain forest suffering from drought (Lewis et al 2011 ), have not produced
an obvious impact on atmospheric CO
2.
However, increased CO 2uptake does not necessarily mean that the biosphere
is healthier or that the increased carbon uptake will continue indeﬁnitely (Matsonet al 2002 , Galloway et al 2002 , Heimann and Reichstein 2008 , Gruber and
Galloway 2008 ). Nor does it change the basic facts about the potential magnitude
of the fossil fuel carbon source (ﬁgure 6) and the long lifetime of the CO
2in the
surface carbon reservoirs (atmosphere, ocean, soil, biosphere) once the fossilfuels are burned (Archer 2005 ). Fertilization of the biosphere affects the
distribution of the fossil fuel carbon among these reservoirs, at least on the shortrun, but it does not alter the fact that the fossil carbon will remain in thesereservoirs for millennia.
Humanity, so far, has burned only a small portion (purple area in ﬁgure 6)o f
total fossil fuel reserves and resources. Yet deleterious effects of warming areapparent (IPCC 2007 ), even though only about half of the warming due to gases
6Environ. Res. Lett. 8(2013) 011006 Perspective
now in the air has appeared, the remainder still ‘in the pipeline’ due to the inertia
of the climate system (Hansen et al 2011 ). Already it seems difﬁcult to avoid
passing the ‘guardrail’ of no more than 2◦C global warming that was agreed in
the Copenhagen Accord of the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change (UNFCCC 2010 ). And Hansen et al (2008 ), based primarily on
paleoclimate data and evidence of deleterious climate impacts already at 385 ppmCO
2, concluded that an appropriate initial target for CO 2was 350 ppm, which
implied a global temperature limit, relative to 1880–1920 of about 1◦C. What is
clear is that most of the remaining fossil fuels must be left in the ground if we areto avoid dangerous human-made interference with climate.
The principal implication of our present analysis probably relates to the
Faustian bargain. Increased short-term masking of greenhouse gas warming byfossil fuel particulate and nitrogen pollution represents a ‘doubling down’ of theFaustian bargain, an increase in the stakes. The more we allow the Faustian debtto build, the more unmanageable the eventual consequences will be. Yet globallythere are plans to build more than 1000 coal-ﬁred power plants (Yang and Cui2012 ) and plans to develop some of the dirtiest oil sources on the planet (EIA
2011 ). These plans should be vigorously resisted. We are already in a deep
hole—it is time to stop digging.

Introduction

Sri Lanka hosts a population of 21 million people in a relatively small area of
65,610 km? (Fig. 1). Relatively high rainfall (1830 mm annually) and an equable
temperature regime along with fertile soils have enabled the adequate provision of
food and water to its people. Although agricultural production has increased over
the last century, the population has been rising, reaching 21 million in 2011 from
14.7 million in 1980 (Department of Census and Statistics, 2012b). While advances

Climate Change Impacts on Rice Farming Systems in Northwestern Sri Lanka 317

Sri Lanka has achieved tremendous progress since 1950 in crop production
and food availability (Department of Agriculture, 2010; Ministry of. Agriculture
and Agrarian Services, 2008). Yields grew at an impressive rate until leveling off
in the mid-eighties (Department of Agriculture, 2009). Sri Lanka’s population is
anticipated to continue’ to grow in the coming decades (Department of Census
and Statistics, 2012a), creating an ever-greater demand for food security on the
household, sub-district, regional, and national scales (Sangakkara and Nissanka,
2008).

The agricultural sector in Sri Lanka is vulnerable to climate shocks (Yahiya
et al., 2011; Zubair, 2002), An unusual succession of droughts and floods from
2008 to 2014 has led to both ‘booms and busts in agricultural production, which
were reflected in food prices (Gadgil et al., 2011; Zubait, 2005). In both instances,
the majority of farmers and consumers were adversely affected. The cultivation of
some of the other crops (such as onions, chilies, and vegetables) has become more
economically viable especially with the constraint of water. A typical small-scale
farming system is represented schematically in Fig. 2. The household unit includes

a home garden, other field crops, and livestock.

Climate Change Impacts on Rice Farming Systems in Northwestern Sri Lanka 319

There is a millennium-long history of adaptation (spatially and seasonally) to
climate variability across the island through choice of climatically and environmen-
tally appropriate varieties, tailoring of planting season by region, development of
appropriate irrigation infrastructure, and social and trade arrangements to suit com-
munal agricultural practices (Zubair, 2005). These adaptation methods afford some

~ potential for coping with future climate change, but they may not be capable of
! dealing with unprecedented changes. There is an ongoing program of rice varietal
# improvement at the Department of Agriculture and universities which historically
> have an excellent track record.

The AgMIP (Rosenzweig et al., 2012) regional assessment in Sri Lanka addresses
these issues by generating future climate projections and using them to drive crop
snodels that feed into integrated climate-crop-economic models that in turn quantify
climate impacts on livelihoods and poverty. We also test adaptation strategies in this
modeling framework under future representative agricultural pathways (RAPs).

Interactions with Stakeholders, Adaptation Options, and Agricultural
Pathways

Government policymakers, water-resource managers, local government officials,
and farmers have highlighted the need for reliable climate change information, the
need to orient research to address the questions they face for allocating resources,
and the need for researchers to stay engaged and to disseminate learning.

Interactions with stakeholders

Personnel from the Department of Agriculture involved with the AgMIP regional
integrated assessment have solicited advice at departmental meetings and are in a
position to contribute to departmental policy.

We have reviewed climate risk information needs with personnel of the Mahaweli
Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL), which is a large river basin management agency
that provides services for the farmers in its domain (including water distribution,
seed distribution, agricultural extension, community development, and enterprise
development). The MASL coordinates national wafer management, to which effort
the project investigators have provided a weekly climate advisory.

The University of Ruhuna researchers are engaged in a project to undertake
multi-sectoral, multi-institutional, community-based climate risk management in
the Nilwala river basin in the south (Zubair et al., 2014). The perspectives of
farmers and officials in this region regarding climate change and adaptation were

solicited.

320 E, Zubair et al.

We also interacted with bulk purchasers of rice husks for energy conversion and
tice for export as regards their needs for climate based predictions and projections
of rice harvests (Zubair et al., 2014),

Key decisions for national policymaking

Among the key decisions for rice farming systems for the decades ahead are devel-
opment of national plans for agriculture, land and water resources, food security,
environment, poverty alleviation, and guidance for long-term infrastructural invest-
ments. -

Potential adaptation strategies

Based on a review of national policy documents related to agriculture and climate
change adaptation (e.g., Ministry of Agricultural Development and Agrarian Ser-
vices, 2007; Ministry of Environment, 2010), assessments of researchers, and inter-
actions with stakeholders including farmers, the following adaptation strategies have
been proposed: (1) investment in research, innovation, and technology diffusion; (2)
promotion of better-adapted cultivation practices and adaptive management of farm-
ing systems; (3) risk management of shocks to the farm economy due to climate,
pest, diseases, and market volatility; (4) decrease in food losses from farm gate to
consumption; and (5) restructuring of policies on farming subsidies, price supports,
crop insurance, and trading policies. These policy interventions can be sharpened
and prioritized with better information on climate change and its impacts.

Farmer perceptions of climate change and potential adaption

Researchers solicited farmer perspectives in the Kurunegala (Migalewa, Kadawara-
mulla), Ampara (Mahawanawella), and Matara districts (Nilwala Basin) (Fig. 1) —
details in Zubair et al. (2014), Farmers in Migalewa perceive the following as major
climate-related problems:

» Climate: (1) Changes in total seasonal rainfall; (2) changes in starting date and
duration (number of days) of growing season; (3) increase in occurrence of
drought; (4) more frequent drought following intense rainfall.

e Crops: Increase in occurrence of crop damages and reduction in harvest due to
drought.

« Water supply: (1) drop of groundwater level; (2) decrease of water supply for
cultivation; (3) reduction in the duration of water supply for cultivation.

e Pest and diseases: (1) appearance of new diseases and pest attacks,

Climate Change Impacts on Rice Farming Systems in Northwestern Sri Lanka 321

While issues related to flooding and deforestation were not discounted, these
were not a priority for the farmers. They identified the following as practical adap-
tation options: (1) application of organic fertilizers, insecticides, and herbicides; (2)
use of drought-tolerant varieties and shorter-duration crops; (3) change of seasons for
cultivation and of planting dates; (4) crop diversification and intercropping; (5) rain-
water harvesting; and (6) diversification of livelihoods and non-agricultural income
sources. Farmers did not think it was practical either to undertake drip irrigation or
energy-intensive cultivation.

Constructing Representative Agricultural Pathways

Representative agricultural pathways (RAPs) ensemble an overall narrative descrip-
tion of a plausible future development pathway and key variables with qualitative
storylines and quantitative trends — consistent with higher level pathways such
as SSPs and RAPs developed by the AgMIP global modeling group (Rosenzweig,
et al., 2013a ) described further in Part 1, Chapter 5 in this volume.

RAPs were constructed in consultation with researchers and officials, officers
of the Department of Agriculture, and the other departments based on literature
from several government agencies, consultation meetings, and iterative review. The
salient projected changes that are most likely in the coming decades are:

» The current trend of economic growth is projected to continue.

e Population growth rate remains low and urban population increases while rural
household size decreases, and farm size declines.

e Rice productivity shall be adversely affected due to deterioration of soil fertility,
extreme weather events, climate change, and phasing out of fertilizer subsidies
(without adaptation). ;

+ Transportation infrastructure improves and trade policy encourages exports an
imposes high taxes on imports of food that can be grown locally.

e Technology developments in the rice sector with high-yielding, drought--and
flood-tolerant cultivars, and improved crop management practices shall improve
rice productivity.

Summary Narrative of the Adopted RAP

Best practices are implemented in a context of economic growth, low population
growth, urbanization, and increasing productivity in the rice sector in a business-
as-usual scenario. The government invests more in agriculture to improve food
security through self-sufficiency in rice within a framework that promotes the ability
of the rice sector to cope with impacts of a variable climate. This is done in a

magnitude of change and the confidence of all the variables were assessed with the
involvement of experts.

Inrelation to the biophysical parameters, temperature changes and land degrada-
tion were identified as important, while there was low confidence on the precipitation
increases that have been projected in the past. Among the socio-economic parame-
ters, the current and likely future dearth of agricultural labor and outward migration
for employment were identified as important parameters. Among the institutional
and policy changes, a reduction in fertilizer subsidies is anticipated, even while
investment in the agriculture sector could increase and the coordination among dif-
ferent agencies dealing with agriculture could improve. In the technological realm, it
is anticipated with high confidence that farmers will have improved access to infor-
mation on markets, weather, and climate in the future and that improved varieties
of rice will become available.

Data

Sri Lanka has rich archives of agronomic data (Pain, 1986; Wickremasinghe, 2006),
which have led to (1) long-term studies on crops, including detailed field trials and
coordinated rice trials; (2) long-term climate data at fine resolution (e.g., Zubair,
2004); (3) household-level survey data and aggregated data for economic analysis
and (4) data from rice research stations and university research programs.

Climate data

Station data.

Meteorological data for Batalagoda (7.51° N, 80°43’ E), Maha Iluppallama (8°10
N, 80°45’ E), and Maho (7°82’ N, 80°27’ E) of precipitation, maximum temperature,
and minimum temperature were obtained for the period of 1 980-2012. Daily rainfail,
minimum and maximum temperature, atmospheric pressure, and sunshine hours are
recorded at these stations (Zubair et al., 2014).

Reanalyses data

The AgMERRA data produced by the AgMIP Climate Team (Ruane et al., 2014)
from the MERRA data (Rienecker et al., 2011) were used for gap-filling and for
variables that were not available, after applying necessary bias-corrections.

Climate change model simulations and scenarios

The data from the 20 GCMs in the CMIPS5 archive (Taylor et al., 2012) were
used for projecting future climate. Analysis was restricted to five GCMs (CCSM4,

324 L, Zubair et al.

GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, MIROCS, and MPI-ESM-MR) that were identi
fied by AgMIP as relatively skillful in reproducing the climate over South Asia by
AgMIP. oe

Crop Data

Aggregate historical data on area of cultivation, production, and yield are estimated -
collectively by several government agencies.

Rice experimental trials

Experimental data for rice trials are available from thte Department of Agriculture
(Batalagoda, Maha IIlupallama, and other field stations). Calibrations were carried
out on the following varieties of data in wide spread use in the region — Bg300
(three months duration), At308 (three months), Bg357 (three-and-a-half months),
Bg358 (three-and-a-half months), and Bg379-2 (four to four-and-a-half months). 2
Forther details are available in the chapters on calibration in Zubair er al. (2014)
including for other varieties (Bg250, Bg304, Bg307, Bg94-1).

Data from (1) detailed field trails and (2) Coordinated Rice Variety Trials
(CRVTs), were used for calibration and evaluation of models. These detailed exper-
iments, conducted at the Rice Research and Development Institute (RRDI) of Sri
Lanka at Bathalagoda, from 2001-2010 in the major (Maha) and minor (Yala)
growing seasons with two nitrogen fertilizer levels. CRVTs were conducted at two
different agroecological regions of RRDI and FCRDI (Field Crop Research and
Development Institute (FCRDI) at Maha Iluppallama), during the two growing
seasons from 2000 to 2008.

The size of the experimental plot was.18 m? (6m x 3 m). Recommended standard
procedures by the Department of Agriculture (DOA) were adapted for rice crop
management. Irrigation was provided, then the land was ploughed, crop residues of
the previous season were incorporated three weeks before planting, and the soil was
puddled continuously with subsequent ploughing/harrowing actions undertaken at
least twice to make the fields weed-free and level before planting.

The crop was established by broadcasting pre-germinated seeds (direct seeding
at a rate of around 350 plants/m?). Irrigation water was provided as required and
maintained at a standing water level of about 25 mm starting from one week after
emergence until grain-filling was completed.

Fertilizer application was carried out asrecommended by the DOA. Split applica-
tion was practiced as at planting, first top dressing (two weeks after planting), second
top dressing (five weeks after planting), third top dressing (seven weeks after plant-
ing) for three-month varieties, and additional application of N at booting stage for

the DOA recommended fertilizer levels. Continuous monitoring of pest and disease
outbreaks was undertaken and appropriate control measures were applied whenever
necessary.

For the detailed experiments, growth and development parameters (plant height,
leaf area, and tiller count) were recorded at regular intervals, along with time taken
to panicle initiation, anthesis and maturity stages. Yield and yield components were
measured at maturity. For CRVT experiments, time taken to heading and harvesting
stages; and yield measurements were recorded.

Data for Integrated Assessment

Researcher-conducted surveys of farming systems are available for a cross-section
of farmers in selected locales in the Kurunegala district (Fig. 1). These locales are
referred to as Set 1 (Nikaweratiya, Rajangane, and Batalagoda) and Set 2 (Kadawara-
mulla, Migalewa) and details are provided in Zubair et al, (2014). All of the locations
except Kadawaramulla practice cultivation in the minor Yala season, In Kadawara-
mulla there is a system of irrigation in alternate years for Yala for each bank of the
feeder irrigation canal. Including Kadawaramulla ensures that we capture practices
that are representative of the entire district. Although we have conducted surveys
for two successive Yala seasons for Kadawaramulla, the year it received irrigation
coincided with a drought that devastated the tice crop during the Yala season. So for
Set 2, to be able to represent both seasons, we report here on the results for Migalewa
while detailed results for Kadawaramulla are not shown here, but are included in
Zubair et al. (2014) and in Herath et al. (2013).

Soil and climate files were developed for the respective sites based on the
recorded information (Mapa et al., 2005). Additional soil testing was undertaken for
Kadawaramulla and Migalewa (Zubair et al.,2014). Crop management practices for
farmer fields were estimated based on the farmer-survey information and standard

practices.

Methods of Study

Climate

The work followed methods outlined in the AgMIP Handbook (Rosenzweig et al.,
2013a) and described further in Part 1, Chapter 3 in this volume.

Quality control

Inconsistent data entries were identified and removed. Neighboring station data were

compared in cases of unusual observations. The solar radiation data were taken from

Mid-20th century projections

The work reported here focused on GCM-based estimates for the mid-20th century
(2040-2070) under a high-emission-concentration pathway (RCP8.5) (Moss et a/ :
2010; Taylor et al., 2012). The results from the following five GCMs were used for
some of the more detailed analysis as they represent the South Asian region better:
CCSM4, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, MIROCS, and MPI-ESM-MR (labeled
as E, I, K, O, and R Tespectively). The methodology for downscaling the climate
projections to each station was based on the “delta method” (Wilby et al., 2004), The
implementation is described in detail in Part 1, Chapter 3 in this volume. Time series
at individual stations were created by modifying the meteorological station data with
mean monthly spatial differences provided by the WorldClim dataset (Hijmans etal.,
2005).

The significance of future change in this average temperature precipitation and
of all 20 GCMs were tested based on whether there was a change of two standard
deviations of yearly variation (see Part 1, Chapter 3 in this volume).

Crop Model Calibration and Simulations

Calibration

Calibration of DSSAT-CERES-Rice version 4.5 (Jones et al. 2003), and APSIM-
ORYZA version 7.5 (Keating et al., 2003) crop models was undertaken for the
commonly used varieties of rice in Sri Lanka for which experimental data were
available (Bg 250, Bg 300, Bg 357, Bg 358, Bg 379-2, At 307, and At 308). These
data are based at Batalagoda and Maha Tupallama, along with the data from the

DSSAT CERES-Rice calibration

Detailed experiments and CRVT from two experimental sites at Batalagoda and
Mahailluppallama were used. for gencralized likelihood uncertainty estimation
(GLUE) runs, initially only for phenology. Then GLUE-estimated phenology was
fixed for the estimation of growth parameters (G1, G2, G3, G4) by using measured
growth variables in detailed experiments. The grain size (G2) was calculated for
selected varieties based on historical data and fixed for the variety. Therefore, only
G1, G3, and G4 were estimated from GLUE runs of detailed experiments. The crop
model simulations were evaluated by using model efficiency criteria for leaf-area
index (LAD, tops weight, tiller number, and yield predictions for detailed experi-
ments, and yield only for CRVTs. The genetic coefficients obtained are provided in
Table 2.

APSIM calibration

The same dataset used for DSSAT calibration was used for APSIM calibration. The
APSIM-ORYZA model parameters of rice according to different growing stages
were considered for the calibration of the respective varieties; these include two
photoperiod-sensitive stages and two growth parameters. Developmental stages of
the crop model are: :

The fixed values of DVS at important growth stages in APSIM are 0 (at sowing),
0.65 (at panicle initiation), 1 (at flowering), and 2 (at maturity).

Developmental rate parameters (DVS) were calculated by using growing degree
days (GDD). GDD were calculated by using Tmax, Tmin, and base temperature (Tp).

DSSAT-CERES and APSIM-ORYZA crop model simulations

DSSAT-CERES and APSIM-ORYZA simulations were undertaken based on the
farmer surveys identified as Set 1 and Set 2. These simulations were undertaken with
Consistent genetic coefficients, consistent choices for management but differentiated ro
by the details of the farm surveys and the soil and weather for Set 1 and Set 2.

The “TT tools” developed by AgMIP were used to undertake the large number of
simulations required in a batch mode. The weather, soil, fertilizer, water, and crop
management data were incorporated into the input files (Le., field overlay file, survey
data file, and seasonal strategy file) that were prepared for the QUADUI AgMIPIT

tool (Rosenzweig et al., 2013a). This enabled the generation of DOME and ACMO Bes.
files for input into the crop simulations and integrated assessments. L:

Farm-survey data were used in order to match crop management (Hoogenboom —
etal., 2010), ic., planting, harvesting, application of inorganic fertilizer, irrigation, |
and applications of crop residues and organic manure. oi

Yields for the “current year” (2012/2013 for Set 1), were simulated for individual a
farm fields. For Set 2, the current year was September 2011 to August 2012 for
Kadawaramulla and September 2012 to August 2013 for Migalewa. “

Using these simulated results for the “matched data case” (Rosenzweig et al.. F
2013a) were obtained where the models use weather, soil, and management foreach
field to simulate production matched with observed yields for each field. Yields for
the future periods (2040-2069) were obtained by using the corresponding climate
change scenarios derived from global climate models and observed weather data
(Rosenzweig et al., 2013a, 2013b). a.

In simulating the future period, automatic planting was set within an interval
of time with conditions for soil water content (i.e., target rainfall accumulation)
specified at 20 mm. The harvesting option was set as “when the crop is mature”.

Integrated Assessment

We used the Tradeoff Analysis Model for Multi-dimensional Impact Assessment
(TOA-MD) economic model, which is a multi-dimensional impact assessment pro-
gram that utilizes statistics of farm characteristics (means, standard deviations, coef-
ficients of variation) to simulate the impacts of environmental changes on economic
conditions (Antle, 2011; Antle and Valdivia, 2006). In this study we use it to assess
climate change impacts on socio-economic aspects of farming systems with the
intent of providing support for informed policymaking. The model could be used in
the future for prospective evaluation of technology adoption and technology impact
assessment, payments for ecosystem services and environmental change impact and
adaptation.

The TOA-MD analysis was undertaken for a population of heterogenous farms
under one stratum with one production activity of growing rice. These methods were
followed to answer the following three “core climate impact questions” as posed by
AgMIP (Rosenzweig et al., 2013a).

1. What is the sensitivity of current agricultural production systems to climate
change?
This seeks to address the impact of climate change on the current production.

2. What is the impact of climate change on future agricultural production systems?
This seeks to address the impact of climate change on the future production
system. Technological and other developments in the agricultural sector may
alter the current production system in the future. Hence vulnerability to climate
change may be dissimilar to the case of the current production system, which is
described in the Question 1 simulations.

. What are the benefits of climate change adaptations?

This line of inquiry seeks to assess the advantages of adaptation strategies in
abating deleterious climate change impacts on the future rice-production system.
While we have undertaken work on adaptation, it shall be reported in the future.

w

While TOA-MD analysis was initiated for all of the farming systems, in this
chapter results are presented only for Migalewa.

In setting up the TOA-MD model there was one key assumption. The farmer
surveys in Migalewa were undertaken separately for each of the two seasons in
the same small region. The populations of farmers for each season have similar
household economics and use similar crop management practices. In fact, nine

Maha season, there is an increase in temperature ranging from 1.1 to 2.4°C. The
monthly climatology of rainfall in the future period shows a significant increase
from September to November for all GCM scenarios and less change in other

months.

A significance test was undertaken with a
yearly variation for either parameter taken as significant for the mean alone, and
both mean- and variability-based scenarios (see Part 1, Chapter 3 in this volume).
The results show that the temperature rise is significant in both scenarios for all
GCM outputs for both Yala and Maha.

For Maha, there is an increase in average rainfall of up to 9.5 mm/day in the future
period (with one GCM showing a drop of 0.1 mm/day) from a current average of 6
mm/day. This increase in rainfall is significant in both testing scenarios for both Yala

For the Yala season, there is an increase in rainfall of up to 2 mm/day for 10 of
the GCMs and a decrease in rainfall for the rest of up to 1 mm/day from an average
of 3.5 mm/day. However, only 10% of the GCMs showed a significant anomaly (a
rise in this instance), and none of the five selected GCMs had a significant change
in rainfall.

Crop modeling results
DSSAT-CERES calibration results

Simulated results with DSSAT-CERES for time taken to‘panicle initiation, anthesis,
and maturity from emergence compared well with observed values for detailed and
CRVTs experiments. RMSE (root mean square error) was around four to five days
for all varieties (see Fig. 4 for calibration results of anthesis and yield for the Bg 300
cultivar). RMSE for yield was lower for the Bg 357 cultivar (425 kg/ha), compared
to the other two varieties Bg 300 and Bg 358, which ranged from 1800 to 2000
kg/ha. All varieties had a similar RMSE of ~1400 for grain yield. Deviations for
top weights and grain yields for these varieties compared to those observed were
mainly due to biotic stress. For example, CRVTs of Bg 358 recorded lower observed
yields due to a pest attack at grain-filling, which could not be controlled in time.

APSIM-ORYZA calibration results

The APSIM-ORYZA model calibration results (Fig. 4) showed a good fit, indicating
RMSE for time taken to panicle initiation, anthesis, and maturity, were in the range
of three to six days. RMSE for grain yield was around 1000 kg for Bg 300 and Bg
357, while it was higher (1200 kg) for Bg 358. Deviation of simulation for grain
yields for these varieties compared to the observed was mainly associated with the
biotic stress. For example, CRVTs of Bg 358 recorded lower observed yields due to
a pest attack at grain-filling, which could not be controlled in time.

Crop simulation results for farm survey yields and climate scenario effects

Parallel studies were undertaken for two sets of locales chosen from the Kurunegala
district as described in the methodology. Set 1 included farm survey data from Bata-
lagoda, Nikaweratiya, and Rajanganaya and Set 2 included Migalewa and Kadawara-
roulla.

Crop simulations were generated using DSSAT and APSIM crop models. The
same genetic coefficients as described above were used. Simulations for the base
year (2012-2013), historical period (1980-2010), and five GCMs at mid-century

from DSSAT in the top panel for the major (AJ) and minor (B1) seasons. The results from APSIM-
ORYZA simulations are shown in the bottom panel for the major (A2) and minor (B2) seasons.

However, APSIM simulated higher yields during the major season (RMSE of
1700 kg/ha) compared to the minor season (Fig. 5). Multi-model comparison of the
probability of exceedance of simulated vs. observed yield revealed a more-or-less
similar relationship between the two crop models for the minor season compared to
the major season (Fig. 5).

Our simulations are undertaken with the assumption that the crop is not water-
stressed. Water limitation for the rice crop is relatively lower in the major season
than in the minor season. Sensitivity of these crop models to water status may have
contributed to these differences. Farmer survey revealed that some farmers were

unable to get the required fertilizer at the correct time, and the application was Zi
delayed particularly in the minor season. Few farmers, especially in the Batalagoda
region, also reported that their fields were infested with weeds that they were unable
to control. These reasons may have also contributed to lower observed yield for
some farmers, though the amount of fertilizer applied remained the same, resulting ~
in higher simulated yields, RMSE, and poorer yield distribution fit for probability
of exceedance in both crop models (Fig. 6).

Yield prediction with DSSAT with GCM scenarios

reductions for the five GCMs CCSM4, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, MIROCS,
and MPI-ESM-MR (labelled E, I, K, O, and R) were 13, 12, 19, 15, and 16%, while
percent reduction for the minor season was 27, 28, 41, 33, and 36%. The highest
reduction was observed for the HadGEM2-ES (K) GCM for the minor season being
the warmest of selected five GCMs. Since the Yala is the warmer season, it is likely
that if temperature rises excessively, then the rice crop which is usually at its higher
range of temperature tolerance (Weerakoon ef al., 2005) shall be adversely affected.

Yield prediction with APSIM with GCM scenarios

Different responses were observed for the climate change yield simulations with
APSIM. Though a slight yield reduction was observed for all five GCMs in the
major season, higher yields were simulated for four GCMs (except for the Had-
GEM GCM) in the minor season. Percentage yield reductions observed for the
Maha season compared to the base period for the five GCMs (CCSM4, GFDL-
ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, MIROCS, and MPI-ESM-MR) were 5, 5, 8, 5, and 6%
respectively while only 2% reduction was observed for the HadGEM2-ES GCM for

the Yala season, The other GCMs €, I, O, and R) simulated 8%, 9%, 9%, and 3% *
greater yields respectively for the minor season, compared to the baseline period, '
In both seasons the highest yield reduction was observed for the HadGEM GCM.

SET 2: Kadawaramulla and Migalewa

Farmer-specific rice yields were simulated for Set 2 for the historical period and E
the projections of the five GCMs of mid-century (2050s) for the major and minor
seasons using DSSAT and APSIM.

Results of the DSSAT simulations for the historical period of the major and
minor seasons for the Migalewa location of Set 2 (Figs. 8 and 9) are qualitatively
similar to that presented for Set 1. The RMSE of simulated yields is mostly the
same (Fig. 8). The yield distribution as probability of exceedance matches well to
the observed farm yield distribution (Fig. 9).

The yields simulated with DSSAT are reduced for all five GCMs for both major
and minor seasons (Fig. 10). For Migalewa, the percentage yield losses in the
major season compared to baseline for the five GCMs (CCSM4, GFDL-ESM2M,
HadGEM2-ES, MIROCS, and MPI-ESM-MR) were 6.8, 6.1, 14.5, 7.5, and 7.9%
respectively. Similarly for the minor season, the yield reduction was 24.8, 26.7, 36.8,
24.6, and 30.6% respectively. For Kadawaramulla yield reductions in the major

Climate Change Impacts on Rice Farming Systems in Northwestern Sri Lanka 343

Climate change has a net negative economic impact on 76-88% of farmers with

a a
the future agricultural production system. The gains in the future under different
GCMs range between 9.5 and 10% of mean farm returns (bottom left Fig. 11);
aay losses range from 19 to 29% of mean farm returns). The losses under HADGCM-
ES2 (GCM: K) are the highest. Net impact due to climate change would be negative
for all GCM and losses shall range from $-19% of net farm returns).
a ogoe Poverty rate in the future production system without climate change is 27.8%.
“ However poverty rates would increase with climate change by 12-26%. Poverty
rates and per capita incomes under Question 2 have decreased in comparison to
maw Question 1 (without climate change). The increase in off-farm income by 30% as
x oN anticipated under the RAPs has caused this decrease. The decrease in household
sizes (by 16%) has also contributed to bringing down poverty rates.
& 8 4 Sensitivity analysis
To address the sensitivity of the TOA-MD results to the choice of future trends
em @ in the RAPs, we have redone the analysis with a different set of growth factors
obtained mostly from the global IMPACT economic model (Group 2 in Table 5).
Between Group 1 and 2, the trends for global prices, household size, farm area,
co om om and non-agricultural income were identical. There were significant differences in
ee the trends for yield, local prices, and cost of production with the values in Group 2
being approximately about 15-20% greater. The results are shown in Table 7 and

Conclusions and Discussion

A sustained program of research under AgMIP has led to the implementation of
climate, crop, and economic models of rice agricultural systems in Sri Lanka. ‘

Conclusions

Climate

The climate projections show a clear increase in temperature in the mid-20th century
for a high greenhouse gas concentration pathway (RCP8.5); these models show a
tendency towards a wetter future but there is scatter in these results, The results wete
largely consistent across five locations in Sri Lanka and the details are provided for
data from the northwestern Province. The changes in the model output are described
in terms of the Maha and Yala seasons next, The increase in average temperature for
2040-2070 from that of 1980-2010 ranged from 1.1-2.4°C for Maha and 1.5-2.8°C ;
for Yala seasons. The rainfall shows a Slight increase for a preponderance of the 20 '
GCMs in the CMIPS archive, with the highest increase for October-November. :
During Maha, the average rainfall rises from a present average of 6 mm/day up toa
future 9.5 mm/day for 19 of the models while it drops by 0.1 mm/day for one model
The magnitude of the rise was statistically significant for 16 of these models. During :
the Yala season, half of the models showed a decline in average rainfall of up to 1
mm/day from the normal of 2 mumn/day, including four of five selected GCM outputs *
} and 10 of the other models showed an increase — this increase was statistically |

Climate Change Impacts on Rice Farming Systems in Northwestern Sri Lanka 345

Simulations were undertaken for farmer fields with Set 1 and Set 2 of data with
DSSAT and APSIM rice models and the DSSAT results are presented for both sets.
These simulations showed an adequate match of the probability of exceedance in the
case of DSSAT for both sets while the estimates from the APSIM models were lower.

Under the projected climate change, the simulations using DSSAT with climate
change scenarios projected relative yields that were lower for the Maha season (by
6-19% for Set 1 and 6-15% for Set 2) and for the Yala season (24—41% for Set 1
and 25-37% for Set 2).

Crop simulations from DSSAT and APSIM with Set 1 showed contrasting results.
The comparison of simulated and observed yields for the farmer fields in Set.1
showed a lower RMSE with DSSAT than APSIM for Maha but not for Yala. Simu-
lated yields showed yield drops for the future- 12-19% for Maha and 27-41% for
Yala.

The adverse effects were more pronounced for the Yala season. The GCM with
the highest temperature increase — HadGEM2-ES — showed the highest yield
drop — 41% for Yala.

Integrated assessment

The TOA-MD economic model was used to assess the socio-economic impacts on
paddy farmers due to climate change. The projected climate change brings losses for
most farmers (ranging from 75-85% losers depending on the GCMs) for Migalewa.
TOA-MD results for the GCM with the highest temperature increase (HadGEM2-
ES) showed the lowest yields and highest economic impacts with 85% losers.

The impact of climate change on the future production system was assessed
(Question 2) assuming that future production system will differ from current
production system due to continuation of current development trends in the agricul-
ture sector, Considering such trends along with climate change leads to a simulated
77-88% losers in Migalewa.

The results were sensitive to the choices in parameter trends obtained from the
RAPs and the ones obtained from IMPACT. This has important implications for
the design and implementation of policies and, adaptation strategies based on the
analysis of possible future impacts of climate change. More work is needed to
understand better the effects of technology and price trends as a result of global
economic models or other projections.

Discussion

Climate

The future projections for temperature reported here are consistent with past IPCC
projections for South Asia (IPCC, 2007). The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)

""We have assessed the sensitivity of rice yield with temperature; CO», and rainfall by

346 L, Zubair et al.

anticipates an increase in temperature of 2.4 to 2.6°C in the global average for“. -
RCP2.6 for 2046-2065 and an increase in annual rainfall of up to 10% for 208]
2100 (IPCC, 2013).

There has been a multiplicity of downscaled climate projections for Sri Lanka “
based on assessments prior to ARS which was reviewed by Eriyagama and Smakthin,
(2010). These projections agree reasonably among themselves on projections for
temperature and disagree widely among themselves for projections of precipitation, !
The contribution of this work is to undertake assessments with the entire ensemble of iS °
CMIPS models and present the ensemble of results, which also includes uncertainty
among model implementations.

While this work provides for uncertainty among the climate models, we doneed *"" :
to address the larger issue of how well the models perform in this tegion, the smal] “::
spatial scales that we consider, and the robustness of the models as they take on |
different regimes in the climate system. The climate models as implemented also do 7
not provide a basis for future changes in extreme events. These are issues that could
be better answered in the future and should be considered in the interpretation of
implications for policymaking.

In the recent decades, there has been a tendency towards drying conditions in
the study region and in Sri Lanka generally. Such a trend has not been captured
by models in the past. This phenomenon of near-term climate change needs to
be addressed in the future. Thus the paradox of the recent drying trend alongside

projections of wettening needs to be addressed.

Crop

varying each of these parameters individually in the anticipated range of changes
with a DSSAT crop model implementation with Set 1 (Zubair et al., 2014), The
model shows very little sensitivity to changes in rainfall by, and modest sensitivity
to CO:, but high sensitivity to changes in temperature. These results are consistent 7
with past work that shows that rice yields are expected to increase with elevated CO-

levels and decline with increases in temperature (Wassmann and Dobermann, 2007)

but provide specific quantitative details for our model implementation in Zubair :
et al. (2014),

The effects of pests and diseases on paddy production can override some of the
Projections and thus need to be taken account of in the future. The role of rising
salinity will have to be considered in the coastal areas that are vulnerable to salt
water intrusion into groundwater associated with sea level rise.

There is a need to implement modules and test their implementation to take better
account of water stress in the rice crop models as we use these models for relatively :

Climate Change Impacts on Rice Farming Systems in Northwestern Sri Lanka 347

There is a range of climates even within the rice-growing areas of Sri Lanka,
which includes warmer, colder, drier, and wetter climates, and other soil types and
associated agricultural practices for which the crop models should be further tested.
One could also take advantage of practices in locations that may have a present
climate similar to a projected future climate elsewhere.

Integrated assessment

In the RAPs that we used, the future agricultural practices help improve rice produc-
tivity trends and help mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on agricultural
systems, Any RAP is only representative and other choices should be considered.
The results from the TOA-MD model are highly dependent on the crop model sim-
ulations and on model implementation.

Any biases in the crop simulations would affect the TOA-MD results signif-
icantly. The samples used to parameterize the model are fairly small under this
study. In the future, the crop and economic models shall be implemented for other
sites where we already have survey results.

Our analysis points to the likelihood of inadequate income stability of farming
and this can cause farmers to look for other employment options. Increase in off-
farm employment under the RAP could have been one of the factors leading to this
outcome. However this could pose a serious threat to rice production and will need
to be addressed.

An aggregate study (Seo et al., 2005) to assess climate change impacts on agri-
culture in Sri Lanka show that impacts due to climate change could vary from —11
billion rupees to +39 billion rupees nationally depending on the climate scenario
(Seo et al., 2005). This work has provided for economic impacts on a much finer
scale, taking better account of local conditions. Although one may say that there is
general agreement with our work, the state of such studies are preliminary and highly
dependent on future projections, methodology, and future agricultural pathways.

Adaptation measures

The adaptation strategies that were described in the first section of this chapter are
aimed to deal with three important issues. Coping with extreme risks for farmers,
varietal improvement, and coping with water scarcity. An extension to the current
analysis will be to assess the impacts of those adaptation strategies on the agricultural
production system of Migalawa.

Farmer risk reduction and risk transfer

Both our surveys of farmers and work with the economic analysis highlighted
the need for better management of risks that farmers face. Better weather- and

be prioritized if there is a policy priority for sustaining the number of rice farmers -
in Sri Lanka. F

Changes in varietal use and varietal improvement

There is significant variation of climate in Sri Lanka and agricultural practices. Thus.

as climate changes it may still be possible that varieties adapted to other regions
become better suited for a given region. Such an analysis of climate shall pomt

to some options for varietal adoption. Further analysis of data from varietal trials a
may help. In addition, there is an ongoing program of varietal improvement in Sri“:.
Lanka which may be critical as climate changes. The adoption of varieties that Sd
have enhanced flood, drought, salinity, and disease tolerance as the climate and soil ?”
conditions change may be critical to tolerant rice varieties,

Water management

Our work here has been with assumptions of perfect irrigation, However as seen
in Kadawaramulla, drought and irrigation failures are critical. Moreover, there is -
increasing likelihood of diversion of water for urban use and other purposes (Zubair 2.

etal., 2014). Thus greater attention shall have to be paid to assessing the risk of wate:
scarcity in the future in agricultural areas, the risks in ensuring adequate irrigation
and the use of water conservation techniques.

Chemically active climate compounds are either primary compounds like methane (CH 4), removed by
oxidation in the atmosphere, or secondary compounds like ozone (O 3), sulfate and organic aerosols, both
formed and removed in the atmosphere. Man-induced climate–chemistry interaction is a two-way
process: Emissions of pollutants change the atmospheric composition contributing to climate change
through the aforementioned climate components, and climate change, through changes in temperature,dynamics, the hydrological cycle, atmospheric stability, and biosphere-atmosphere interactions, affects
the atmospheric composition and oxidation processes in the troposphere. Here we present progress in
our understanding of processes of importance for climate–chemistry interactions, and their contribu-tions to changes in atmospheric composition and climate forcing. A key factor is the oxidation potential
involving compounds like O
3and the hydroxyl radical (OH). Reported studies represent both current and

studies of chemically active climate compounds like O 3, and of particles inducing both direct and indirect
effects. Through EU projects like ACCENT, QUANTIFY, and the AeroCom project, extensive studies on
regional and sector-wise differences in the impact on atmospheric distribution are performed. Studies
have shown that land-based emissions have a different effect on climate than ship and aircraft emissions,and different measures are needed to reduce the climate impact. Several areas where climate change can
affect the tropospheric oxidation process and the chemical composition are identiﬁed. This can take
place through enhanced stratospheric–tropospheric exchange of ozone, more frequent periods withstable conditions favoring pollution build up over industrial areas, enhanced temperature induced
biogenic emissions, methane releases from permafrost thawing, and enhanced concentration through
reduced biospheric uptake. During the last 5–10 years, new observational data have been made available
and used for model validation and the study of atmospheric processes. Although there are signiﬁcantuncertainties in the modeling of composition changes, access to new observational data has improved
modeling capability. Emission scenarios for the coming decades have a large uncertainty range, in
particular with respect to regional trends, leading to a signiﬁcant uncertainty range in estimated regionalcomposition changes and climate impact.

1. Introduction
The coupling between climate change and atmospheric
composition results from the basic structure of the Earth-atmo-
sphere climate system, and the fundamental processes within it.
The composition of the atmosphere is determined by natural and
human-related emissions, and the energy that ﬂows into, out of,
and within the atmosphere. The principal source of this energy is
sunlight at ultraviolet (UV), visible, and near-infrared (NIR)
wavelengths. This incoming energy is balanced at the top of the
atmosphere by the outgoing emission of infrared (IR) radiation
from the Earth’s surface and from the atmosphere. The structure of
the troposphere (with temperature generally decreasing with
altitude) is largely determined by the energy absorbed at or near
the Earth’s surface, which leads to the evaporation of water and
the presence of reﬂecting clouds. Through many interactions, the
composition and chemistry of the atmosphere are inherently
connected to the climate system. The importance of climate–
chemistry interactions has been recognized for more than 20 years
(Ramanathan et al., 1987 ).
Atmospheric composition inﬂuences climate by regulating the
radiation budget. As shown in Fig. 1 , clouds reﬂect incoming solar
radiation (the albedo effect) and absorb outgoing surface thermal
radiation, and reradiate at the local temperature (the greenhouse
effect). It is well recognized that the thermal structure of the
atmosphere is inﬂuenced by the presence of small amounts of H 2O,
CO2,C H 4,O3, and aerosols. The main radiative effect of the gases isthrough the greenhouse effect, while aerosols may either heat or
cool the surface, depending on their optical properties, which affect
the solar and thermal radiation.
Compounds like methane, ozone, and different types of
secondary particles (sulfate, organic particles and nitrate) are active
chemical compounds in the troposphere; they also have important
radiative effects on climate. These compounds are either emitted
directly into the atmosphere (methane, primary particles), or

either strongly controlled by chemical oxidation in the atmosphere
(e.g., methane and ozone), removed through cloud and precipita-
tion processes (primary and secondary particles), or deposited on
the Earth’s surface (ozone, particles). Note that the effects on
climate from O 3and secondary particles are non-uniform and will
be more difﬁcult to assess than those of the well-mixed greenhouse
gases (methane). For example, changes in absolute O 3densities in
the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere have been demon-
strated to lead to pronounced impact on surface temperature
(Wang and Sze, 1980; Lacis et al., 1990 ).
Pollutants such as CO, VOC, NO xand SO 2, which by themselves
are negligible greenhouse compounds, have an important indirect
effect on climate by altering the abundances of radiatively active
gases such as O 3and CH 4. Furthermore, they act as precursors for
sulfate and secondary organic particles. Oxidation in the tropo-
sphere, driven by solar UV photo dissociation, result in the
formation of the hydroxyl radical (OH), the key oxidant in the
troposphere. The hydroxyl radical initiates a large number of
chemical reactions affecting the climatically important compounds
such as ozone, methane, and secondary particles.
Although the potential importance of the coupling between
climate change and atmospheric chemistry has been recognized for
some time, it is only recently that it has been possible to capture the
full complexity of the most important interactions. Observations
and theory go hand in hand towards understanding this
complexity. An important example is the emerging evidence that
key interactions can occur through atmosphere-biosphere inter-
actions ( Fowler et al., 2009 ), affecting biogenic emissions, ozone
deposition, uptake and removal of particles in clouds.
New observations, in particular from satellite platforms, provide
data to verify models and to diagnose the chemical and physical
processes, which are important for understanding chemical
distributions and processes involved, as well as their long time
trends and sensitivity to climate change.
Tropospheric climate–chemistry interactions deal to a largely
with chemical processes and compounds that show large inho-
mogeneous global distribution and trends, mainly initiated by
inhomogeneous distribution of precursor emissions. There have
been extensive studies of climate impact from speciﬁc sectors with
large spatial variations in emissions and composition changes such
as air and ship trafﬁc during the past 3–5 years ( Sausen et al., 2005;
Eyring et al., 2005a,b ;Eyring et al., 2007a; Dalsøren et al., 2007 ).
The potential impact from such sectors is discussed.
There are signiﬁcant differences in the temporal changes of
human-related emissions and natural emissions as well as in their
geographical distribution. Human-related emissions are character-
ized by different responses worldwide to regulations and to different
growth rates in energy use, in transportation systems, and in
industrial behavior. European and U.S. emissions of pollutants
generally show reductions from regulatory actions over the last 2 to
3 decades, while emissions in regions like Southeast Asia, and in
other developing countries show large increases during recent years.
Similarly, certain industrial sectors such as aircraft and shipping
show large increases, with potential for further large increases in the
future (see Chapter 3). Natural emissions of key climate precursors
(NO x, CO, biogenic VOCs and sulfur compounds) are characterized
with large year-to-year variations (e.g., biomass burning).
In addition, there is a strong potential for large changes in the
emission and deposition of these compounds resulting from future
climate change (e.g., due to changes in surface temperature,
moisture, atmospheric stability and biogenic activity). Such climate
responses have the potential to affect global chemistry. Although
there are a few recent examples indicating possible strong feedback
from climate change ( Zeng and Pyle, 2003; Collins et al., 2003; Sitchet al., 2007; Solberg et al., 2008 ), further studies are needed to
reveal the full extent of this impact.
This synthesis is based on studies following the Working Group
I Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC ( IPCC, 2007 ). ACCENT
activities, and activities obtained in other EU ﬁnanced projects
have initiated some of the results described. The IPCC report
describes progress in understanding of the human and natural
drivers of climate change, climate processes and attribution,
observed climate changes and estimates of projected future
changes. We will especially focus on developments of signiﬁcance
for climate–chemistry interactions that have appeared after the
writing of the IPCC report, with reference to newly published
research results. We will, however, also include earlier work where
we ﬁnd it necessary, to give a more comprehensive picture of the
scientiﬁc development.
2. Key interactions in the climate–chemistry system
The physical climate is a major determinant of the atmospheric
concentration for all chemically active species, including key
climate compounds like CH 4,O3and secondary aerosol compounds
like sulfate and organic aerosols. This applies both locally (more
important for short-lived species, e.g., ozone, aerosols) and globally
(more important for long-lived species, e.g., methane). The physical
state of the atmosphere varies considerably with location, in
particular with altitude and latitude. Physical climate exerts its
inﬂuence in many ways, e.g., by affecting natural emissions,
photolysis rates, chemical reactions, transport and mixing, and
deposition processes. When considering climate–chemistry inter-
actions in the atmosphere, it is not only important to study the
emissions and distribution of the climate compounds, but also to
consider the chemical processes and the distribution of the
compounds determining the tropospheric oxidation.
An overview of important climate–chemistry interactions is
given in Fig. 2 for the chemical active climate compounds O 3,C H 4,
and particles (sulfate, secondary organic aerosols (SOA)) and dis-
cussed in Chapter 7.
The role of climate for atmospheric chemistry can be demon-
strated by considering its inﬂuence on the hydroxyl radical (OH).
OH is the major component for the overall oxidising capacity of the
troposphere. The primary source of OH is the reaction of excited
state oxygen atoms, and it is formed from ozone photolysis, and
reaction with water vapour:
O3Dhn/Oð1DÞDO2ðl<320 nm Þ (R1)
Oð1DÞDH2O/2OH (R2)
Water vapour concentrations are assumed to increase in
a warming climate, thus increasing the rate of reaction R2, which
contributes to ozone loss as it competes with the stabilization of O
(1D) to the ground-state oxygen atom that would return ozone. On
the other hand, higher temperatures also cause larger emissions of
isoprene, an important ozone precursor, and reduce the stability ofPAN, thus releasing NO
x, which catalyzes ozone production. Model
studies indicate that the result of these temperature responses
would be an increase in summertime ozone over polluted areas and
a reduction of background ozone ( Jacob and Winner, 2009 ). The
same publication also summarizes possible effects of temperature
increase on particle formation, with sulphate aerosols likely to
increase in a warming climate related to faster SO 2oxidation
(Aw and Kleeman, 2003; Dawson et al., 2007; Kleeman, 2007 ),
while nitrate particles and organic semi-volatile components are
reduced as they shift from the particle phase to the gas phase
(Sheehan and Bowman, 2001; Tsigaridis and Kanakidou, 2007 ).I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 51412.1. Observing chemistry–climate interactions
Direct observation of chemistry–climate interactions is extremely
challenging. Composition change is often caused by non-climate
factors such as anthropogenic emission trends, while multiple
forcing agents have caused climate change in recent decades. This
makes it difﬁcult to attribute trends to particular gaseous or aerosol
species. The hemispheric asymmetry of observed temperature
trends and characteristics of the regional spatial structure of
temperature changes have been used however to indirectly estimate
the effects of Northern Hemisphere sulfate aerosols ( Santer et al.,
1996; Kaufmann and Stern, 2002; Stott et al., 2006 ).
Some effects of climate change on chemistry are observed
during short-term climate anomalies periods. For example, as
expected from the atmospheric increase in sulfate particles, global
temperatures decreased signiﬁcantly during the years following
the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Observations show that tropo-
spheric water vapor decreased after the eruption ( Soden et al.,
2002 ), in agreement with the response seen in climate models.
Additionally, methane emissions from wetlands were reduced
during this time ( Walter et al., 2001 ). Observations provide addi-
tional evidence for climate-sensitive emissions: Satellite measure-
ments show inter-annual variations in formaldehyde distributions
that appear to be tied to changes in biogenic isoprene emissions
(Palmer et al., 2006 ). Ice core records show that emissions of
mineral dust can also change dramatically with climate change, at
least over glacial-interglacial transitions ( Delmonte et al., 2004 ).
Large inter-annual variations in biomass burning have also beenobserved ( van der Werf et al., 2006 ), some of which have been
related to climate (such as anomalies following a large ENSO event).
The inﬂuence of composition changes on climate has been
estimated using a variety of observations. Changes in the Earth’s
outgoing energy have been observed at precisely the wavelengths
where CO 2, methane and ozone absorb long-wave radiation,
demonstrating their impact in the enhancement of the greenhouse
effect ( Harries et al., 2001 ). Recently, satellite data have been used
to estimate the clear-sky radiative forcing from upper tropospheric
ozone over the oceans at 0.48 /C60.14 W m/C02(Worden et al., 2008 )
(note that this is a total forcing value, not the anthropogenic
portion). For aerosols, satellite-based estimates of the direct all-sky
forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) have yielded values
of/C00.35 to /C00.9 W m/C02(Chung et al., 2005; Bellouin et al., 2005;
Quaas et al., 2008 ), with uncertainty ranges that do not overlap,
emphasizing the large uncertainties resulting from the use of
satellite measurements of optical attenuation to infer aerosol
forcing. Such estimates require assumptions about factors such as
aerosol composition, shape, scattering properties, and location
relative to clouds. Satellite data have also been used to estimate
radiative forcing due to indirect effect of aerosols on cloud albedo
(the ﬁrst indirect effect), yielding a value of /C00.2/C60.1 W m/C02
(Quaas et al., 2008 ), substantially lower than that seen in most
forward model calculations.
Although there are limitations to forcing estimate from ozone
and aerosols using satellite observations, such data usually have
better global coverage than traditional data from ground based and
aircraft observations. One limitation with satellite data is that

approximately where the effects are most pronounced.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5142forcing is based on the total abundance of the species rather than
on the anthropogenic contribution. Additionally, satellite data are
generally limited in spatial coverage, and tend to lack sufﬁcient
coverage at high latitudes. Furthermore, radiative forcing, while
a useful metric, does not describe fully the climate response to
ozone and aerosols, especially at regional scales. Finally, the infor-
mation obtained by satellites is not sufﬁcient to characterize the
effects of aerosols.
At smaller spatial scales, much more detailed measurements are
available, giving more precise estimates of aerosol radiative effects.
For example, absorbing aerosols can substantially perturb both
total organic aerosols and surface radiative ﬂuxes ( Satheesh and
Ramanathan, 2000 ). Aerosols can also have a strong warming effect
by enhancing cloudiness at high latitudes during seasons with little
sunlight ( Garrett and Zhao, 2006; Lubin and Vogelmann, 2006 )
(see Section 6.4.2 ). Model studies have provided indirect conﬁr-
mation of the ability of aerosols to modulate local temperatures and
precipitation based on comparison of climate observations with
simulations with and without observed absorbing aerosols ( Menon
et al., 2002 ). These data provide valuable information about
chemistry–climate interactions on regional scales.
2.2. Modeling chemistry–climate interactions
A range of numerical models is developed to investigate
connections between atmospheric chemistry and the climate
system. Past changes in atmospheric composition and climate, and
projections of the future state of the atmosphere under various
scenarios use such models to understand observations. The
following discussion is restricted to models at the global scale.
Chemistry-Transport Models (CTMs) are three-dimensional
models of atmospheric composition driven by meteorological data.
The use of re-analyzed data makes it possible to simulate the real
evolution of the atmosphere; output from such models can then be
usefully compared to observational data, for example for model
validation. Extensive model validation was performed through the
ACCENT project inter-comparisons both for gas phase compounds
and for particles ( Shindell et al., 2006; Schulz et al., 2006 ). CTMs
that additionally assimilate atmospheric composition data, for
example from surface stations, sondes or satellites, are used to
simulate ‘‘Chemical Weather’’. These models can provide short-
term forecasts of the atmospheric composition, for example air
quality forecasts, and can be used in ﬂight route planning during
aircraft observation campaigns. Assimilation of atmospheric data is
extensively used for estimating emissions of compounds like CO
and CH 4(Butler et al., 2005; Bousquet et al., 2006; Bergamaschi
et al., 2007; Pison et al., 2009 ).
Alternatively, climate models provide meteorological data –
such models are called Chemistry–Climate Models (CCMs). CCMs
include different degrees of coupling between the climate and
chemistry components.
A CCM simulates the physical state of the atmosphere (dynamics
and thermodynamics), largely determined by the ﬂows of energy
through the atmosphere and across its lower boundary with theEarth’s surface. The chemistry model simulates the chemical state
of the atmosphere, integrating the emissions, transport, mixing,
physical and chemical transformation, and deposition of key
atmospheric components (trace gases and aerosols). All these
processes are linked to the physical state of the atmosphere, which
to a varying degree is parameterized in the models. Transport and
mixing are determined by wind ﬁelds and by atmospheric stability.
Chemical and photochemical reaction rates are functions of many
physical variables, such as levels of ultraviolet radiation, pressure
and temperature. Dry deposition to the Earth’s surface is controlled
by boundary layer turbulence and the surface properties, and therate of natural emissions of several important species is strongly
linked to the physical climate.
While the physical climate strongly inﬂuences the chemical
climate, as outlined above, there are also inﬂuences of the chemical
climate on the physical climate in this coupled system. Transmission
of radiation through the atmosphere depends on the distribution of
radiatively active gases and aerosols. In the stratosphere, where large
quantities of UV radiation are absorbed mainly by ozone, signiﬁcant
local heating, and reduced penetration into the troposphere occur.
Parameterizations of stratospheric interactions in a CCM remain
a major research area since the high complexity of CCMs requires
as y s t e m a t i ce v a l u a t i o no ft h er e s u l t so ft h es i m u l a t i o n sa sw e l la sa
quantiﬁcation of uncertainties in the model results. This effort is
part of the Chemistry–Climate Model Validation Activity (CCMVal)
of the SPARC (Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate
Programme) ( Eyring et al., 2005a,b; 2006; 2007b ).
Aerosol–cloud interactions represent an area with potential for
strong interactions in the climate system. Aerosols determine the
cloud radiative properties and thus the radiative heating/cooling,
and participate in the precipitation process. Fig. 3 illustrates the
processes linking aerosols, clouds and climate. Although consider-
able progress has been made in recent years to include parame-
terization of aerosol–cloud droplet interaction and explicit
microphysics for cloud water/ice content in GCMs, inadequate
understanding of the processes contributes to signiﬁcant uncer-
tainties in model simulated future climate changes. The individual
components shown in Fig. 3 are currently being developed, but
there is still a lack of consistent and accurate parameterization for
and their implementation into GCMs is being actively pursued
(IPCC, 2007 ). Further discussions of the interactions are presented
in more detail in Sections 5.2–5.4 .
Tropospheric composition also interacts with the physical
climate system via radiatively active trace gases and aerosols. In
typical ‘‘state-of-the-art’’ climate modeling (IPCC-AR4), changes in
tropospheric composition are calculated ofﬂine and then imposed

Fully coupled CCMs are not yet widely used in studies of tropo-
spheric composition.
2.3. Scale issues
Anthropogenic activity has altered the chemical composition of
the atmosphere on local, regional, and global scales. As of today, no
single model is capable of reproducing a sufﬁciently wide range of
spatial and temporal scales to address all issues related to air
pollution and climate change.
Due to computational requirements, there is a limit to the
resolution of global models, which currently is 0.5 or 1 degree. On
the other hand, in local and regional models it is difﬁcult to account
for processes that occur on the global scale, i.e. outside the modeled
domain, but which affect the regional to local scales within the
model domain. A well-known example is long-range transport of
air pollutants, with intercontinental transport of pollutants and
changes in background concentrations.
Most model results reviewed in this report are taken from global
models, as a number of global models now have sufﬁcient resolu-
tion to cover regional variability as well. However, global scale
models have obvious limitations in representing climate–chemistry
interactions occurring on local scales, such as the impact of particle
emissions or formation of clouds and precipitation.
Fig. 4 compares typical spatial and temporal scales of common
atmospheric processes with different types of models. For example,
deep convection occurs on a spatial scale of a few kilometers and
during a few minutes to hours. Global circulation, such as exchange
between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, occurs on
timescales of several months (troposphere) to years (middle and
upper atmosphere). Typical wind speeds of the respective
processes are used to relate spatial scales to temporal scales. The
ﬁgure also shows typical focus areas of today’s model systems. For
example, global climate models cover the entire globe, i.e. tens of
thousands of kilometers, and are run for up to several decades to
centuries to investigate long-term changes. Urban scale models
cover much smaller domains through which pollutants are mixed
over a much shorter time scale. In order to address all relevant
spatial and temporal scales it is necessary to use advanced
parameterizations or a modeling system consisting of a hierarchy of
models of different scales that are nested into each other. In nesting
approaches, particular attention has to be given to the way models
communicate information to each other.One-way nesting accounts only for inﬂuences from the larger to
the smaller scale, the ﬂow of information going from the coarse
model to the ﬁner-scale model, while in two-way nesting, feedback
processes from the high resolution to the coarse resolution domain
are also considered. The small-scale model uses output from the
large-scale model as boundary condition, while the large-scale
model uses a combination of output from the small-scale model to
deﬁne distributions within the domain covered by the small-scale
model. For instance at the boundaries of the smaller-scale model,
the larger scale model can provide temporally and spatially varying
ozone and particulate matter, which are species that have a sufﬁ-
ciently long lifetime to be transported over the smaller-scale model
domain. In two-way nesting, the larger scale model may replace or
assimilate species distributions from the smaller-scale model in the
grid boxes where a higher resolution is desirable. Depending on the
kind of model (e.g., chemical transport model or numerical weather
prediction model) the output to be exchanged includes chemical
species or meteorological parameters or both. One drawback is that
inconsistencies with the principal equations may emerge after the
distributions calculated by the large-scale model are updated using
output from the small-scale model. This is because after each timestep in the large-scale model the species distributions and mete-
orological parameters are calculated from the principal equations,
and any change due to input from another model will induce
inconsistencies. Currently available nesting techniques can thus
lead to problems such as artiﬁcial variability in large-scale models
that originates from the calculations of small-scale models, but
cannot be resolved in the large-scale models. Although coordina-
tion of research among model groups focusing on different scales is
well underway (e.g., Moussiopoulos and Isaksen, 2006 ), there is
still a long way to go until scale interactions are fully understood
and adequately represented.
2.4. Upper tropospheric processes
Temperatures in the tropical upper troposphere have increased
with about 0.65 K since the 1970s ( Allen and Sherwood, 2008 ),
essentially at what is expected from climate models based on
observed surface temperature trends. Other analyses suggest that
the change in the tropopause height could be a better indication of
climate change than the vertical temperature proﬁle ( Sausen and
Santer, 2003; Santer et al., 2003a; Santer et al., 2003b ). In particular,
changes affecting O
3is important since O 3contributes to chemical
changes and affects the temperature distribution in the upper
Fig. 4. Characteristic spatial scales versus characteristic timescales. Left panel: common atmospheric phenomena. Right panel: atmospheric models cove ring different spatial and
temporal scales. See text for more details.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5144equatorial troposphere/lower stratosphere ( Ramaswamy and
Bowen, 1994; Cariolle and Morcrette, 2006 ). Recent model studies
(Hoor et al., 2009 ) demonstrated that emission from different
sectors ( Hoor et al., 2009 ) has highly different effect on the height
distribution of ozone perturbation in the troposphere, which is
important as indicated in Fig. 1 . Measurements from satellites and
other platforms during recent years have improved the under-
standing of processes in the upper troposphere and lower strato-
sphere (e.g., Pan et al., 2007; Strahan et al., 2007 ).
The ability to represent dynamical processes, in particular
convection, is critical for the calculation of the transport of chem-
ical compounds from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere
of short-lived compounds like NO xand SO 2, and for the downward
transported compounds destroyed at the Earths surface like ozone.
Such processes can also bring insoluble organic trace gases to
higher altitudes to produce new particles ( Kulmala et al., 2006 ).
Currently in global models, this results in large differences in
estimates of transport and chemistry. Furthermore, there are
limitations in our ability to model stratospheric-tropospheric
exchanges (e.g., transport of ozone from the stratosphere to the
troposphere), and chemical source gases emitted at the Earthssurface and water vapor to the stratosphere.
Because of the importance of NO
xchanges to ozone, its distri-
bution and changes in the upper troposphere can be relevant to
climate. Models have generally underestimated the amount of NO x
in the upper troposphere compared with observations ( Schultz,
et al., 1999; Penner et al., 1998 ). In a more recent analysis ( Brunner
et al., 2005 ) based on global model studies in the UTLS region
comparisons were made with observations from two measurement
campaigns. A number of processes affect UTLS NO x, including in
situ production from lightning, emissions from aircraft, convection,
stratospheric intrusions, and photochemical recycling from long-
lived gases, especially peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and nitric acid
(HNO 3).Brunner et al. (2005) concluded that it is difﬁcult to
reproduce the observed distribution and variations, and that
adopted emissions were critical for the modeled results.
Observations have shown that there are speciﬁc processes
that are signiﬁcant for the upper tropospheric chemistry.
Acetone inﬂuences levels of the hydroxyl radical in the upper
troposphere ( Kotamarthi et al., 1999; Folkins and Chatﬁeld,
2000 ). Model studies have demonstrated that upper tropospheric
OH distribution and changes are sensitive to model assumptions
(Shindell et al., 2006 ;Hoor et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, new
particle formation is active in the upper troposphere ( Young
et al., 2007; Benson et al., 2008 ). Emissions from aviation, of
sulfur compounds along with small amounts of soot and
hydrocarbons, will contribute to the formation of new particles.
Once released at cruise altitudes within the upper troposphere
and lower stratosphere, these species interact with the back-
ground atmosphere and undergo complex processes, resulting in
the formation of contrails. Aged contrails may have effects on
upper tropospheric cirrus clouds – and these effects may exert
spatially inhomogeneous radiative impacts on climate.
The occurrence of wild ﬁres can be affected by climate change.
Fires generate updrafts that efﬁciently transport pollutants into the
upper troposphere, a process generally referred to as pyro-
convection. Several studies show that this can have a signiﬁcant
impact on the chemical composition in that altitude region (e.g.,
Damoah et al., 2006 ;Turquety et al., 2007 ).
3. Trends in emissions of chemical species and in chemically
active greenhouse compounds
Understanding of the past developments in emissions of
pollutants and greenhouse gases and the driving forces behind thechanges in strength of speciﬁc sources of radiatively active chem-
ical compounds is crucial for understanding and modeling of the
changing atmosphere as well as for the development of future
policies. While the role and historical trends of speciﬁc compounds
are discussed in the companion paper ( Monks et al., 2009 ), this
paper focuses on projections of future emissions.
The growth in the emissions of pollutants associated with the
growth of industry, transport and agriculture started at the end of the
19th century, and accelerated strongly after the Second World War.
While anthropogenic emissions of SO 2,N O x,C H 4 ,a n dC O 2merely
doubled in the ﬁrst 50 years of the 20th century, the next doubling
took only about half as long followed by another doubling in the last
quarter of the century ( Olivier et al., 2003, Lefohn et al., 1999; Stern,
2005; Smith et al., 2004 ). During the 20th century, emissions of black
carbon (BC) doubled and primary particulate organic carbon (OC)
increased by about 40% ( Bond et al., 2007 ). The largest sources of BC
and OC include solid fuel combustion in the residential sector and
open biomass burning. Recent year’s growth in diesel consumption
in transportation caused rapid increase in BC emissions. In the last
decades of the 20th century, a slowdown or even stabilization of
global emissions of primary air pollutants has been observed. As
discussed in more detail in the companion paper ( Monks et al.,
2009 ), this is due to the effect of air pollution legislation introduced
in the OECD countries starting in the early 1980s. The current
increase, owing to unprecedented growth rates of Asian economies,
primarily China and India, is not expected to continue.
3.1. Future emissions3.1.1. Driving forces
The most important factors determining future emission levels
are activity, level of technology development, and penetration of
abatement measures. Activity changes are strongly linked to
economic, population, and energy growth, but they are also
dependent on the geo-political situation, trade agreements, level of
subsidies, labour costs, etc. While production technology improve-
ments (with respect to emission levels) are also related to economic
growth, a far more important factor is environmental legislation.
The latter can be a key factor in determining the penetration of
abatement measures and consequently the apparent emission
factors. Comparison of historical per-capita NO
xemissions in the
United States and Europe shows a strong relationship to per-capita
income: for example, income above $5,000 in the U.S. led to a strong
increase in car ownership. Recently, several developing countries
reached such income levels and face a rapid increase in trafﬁc-
related emissions and worsening of air quality, especially in mega-
cities. Societal acceptance of measures to improve local air quality
has also grown with increasing economic wealth. Therefore, there
will be limits to growth in air pollutant emissions in the future
(Klimont and Streets, 2007 ). Transportation is one of the fastest
growing sectors, but, owing to ever stricter legislation, its emissions
have been growing at a much slower pace or even declined in some
industrialized countries. A similar development is expected also in
Asia, where many countries either already implement comparableemission limits or prepare respective policies.
Traditionally, national legislation drives the installation of
control technology, but in some regions, international (regional or
global) agreements have become the key drivers. Examples include
the Kyoto Protocol, UNECE CLRTAP (United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe Convention on Long-Range Trans-boundary
Air Pollution) Protocols, and EU Directives. At the national level, the
economic projections are frequently updated, as are some key
activity factors, e.g., population and energy use. Regional or global
projections of drivers are updated less frequently, and such work is
often driven by policy needs, e.g., the global SRES scenarios (SpecialI.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5145Report on Emissions Scenarios) ( Nakicenovic et al., 2000 ) developed
as part of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)
reports, EU energy or agricultural projections, and the work of
international agencies such as IEA (International Energy Agency),
OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development),
and FAO (United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization).

demonstrated in Fig. 5 .
One additional aspect of environmental legislation to be taken
into account is the actual level of compliance. For projections, it is
assumed that the technical abatement measures will be imple-
mented in a timely manner to comply with the law. As far as
performance of the equipment is concerned, approaches vary
between studies: some assume that emission factors equal emis-
sion standards, while others make explicit assumptions about the
probability of failure, e.g., the percentage of ‘smokers’ among the
vehicle population. The latter assumptions most often rely on
the experience with existing equipment that might not necessarily
be representative for the new and future technologies. For a goodunderstanding of the projections, it is of utmost importance to state
these assumptions explicitly. There is also a strong interdepen-
dence among different air pollutant species, such that many species
can be mitigated at the same time by certain kinds of environ-
mental policies, i.e., ambitious CO
2reduction targets will result also
in signiﬁcant overall reduction of air pollutants. On the other hand,
some speciﬁc reduction technologies include a ‘pollution penalty’,
i.e., increase in emissions of other compounds, e.g., slight increase
in fuel consumption when particle traps are installed in vehicles
will lead to increase of several pollutants.
3.1.2. Global and regional future emission inventories
There are a number of key studies and papers that provide
important information on future emission levels, globally and in
certain world regions and countries. The IPCC SRES scenarios ( Naki-
cenovic et al., 2000 ) reﬂect a large, global, long-term effort. Although
the SRES scenarios assume improvements in production technology,
they do not include some of the expected changes in the future
penetration of abatement measures (the impacts of recent legisla-
tion); they do not include either some of the aerosols and PM species
and are available only for aggregated regions rather than countries.
There are a number of global projections that have been pub-
lished in the peer-reviewed literature. For example, Streets et al.(2004) developed a forecast of future BC and OC emissions, drawing
on SRES activity data and incorporating the evolution of production
and control technology, speciﬁcally for non-industrial sectors.
Cofala et al. (2007) developed global projections for air pollutants,
BC, OC, and methane up to 2030. A longer-term projection (up to
2100) for BC and OC also taking into account CO 2abatement options
and policies was prepared by Rao et al. (2005) ; the activity data are
based on the SRES scenarios. The Royal Society Report (2008)
assessed possible future changes in global and regional ozone
concentrations in 2050 and 2100, given changes in socioeconomic
factors ( Riahi et al., 2006 ), trends in emissions of precursor gases as
well as climate change projections. As part of its Clean Air Interstate
Rule (CAIR), the U.S. EPA has developed near-term emission fore-
casts of SO 2and NO x(http://www.epa.gov/cair ).
Several regional projections are also available. For Europe, the
GAINS model ( Amann et al., 2004 ;http://gains.iiasa.ac.at ) includes
projections of air pollutants and greenhouse gases up to 2030,
developed in consultation with national experts ( Amann et al.,
2008; Kupiainen and Klimont, 2007 ) and the EMEP database
(http://www.emep.int ) contains ofﬁcial projections (up to 2020) for
several European countries ( Vestreng et al., 2006 ). For Asia, several
studies looked at particular pollutants (e.g., SO 2,N O x) but recently
more integrated work has been also published, e.g., the Japanese
Regional Emission Inventory in Asia (REAS) ( Ohara et al., 2007 )
presenting emissions for several pollutants for the period 1980–
2020. The GAINS-Asia model has also been updated, superseding
previous versions and published projections based on RAINS-Asia
(Klimont et al., 2009 ).
The SRES scenarios are widely used in the evaluation of the
future distribution of atmospheric compounds. In the framework of
ACCENT and AEROCOM, two other scenarios of the evolution of the
emissions of air pollutants (SO 2,N O x, CO, BC, OC) and methane have
been developed (e.g., Dentener et al., 2005; Dentener et al., 2006b;
Cofala et al., 2007 ). The Current Legislation scenario (CLE) is based
primarily on national expectations of economic and energy growth
and present (end of 2002) emission control legislation. The
Maximum Feasible Reduction (MFR) scenario assumes a full
implementation of all available current emission reduction tech-
nologies. All these scenarios suggest a decrease of most emissions
in OECD countries, but large changes in Asia.
In spite of recently introduced environmental legislation
speciﬁcally targeting transport sector in urban areas as well as
power plant sector, the emissions have continued to grow in Asia:
the contribution of Asian emissions to the global emissions of SO 2
Fig. 5. Change in NO xfuture emissions resulting from trafﬁc emissions limits, compared with the original SRES scenarios B2 and A2.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5146and NO xincreased from about 30 and 20 percent in the beginning
of the 90’s to 50 and 35 percent in 2005, respectively ( Cofala et al.,
2007 ). Early inventories and projections suffered from poor data
availability, were too optimistic about the pace of introduction and
efﬁciency of environmental legislation, and underestimated the
economic growth, and several authors reassessed their previous
emission estimates for Asia for several pollutants, e.g., Streets et al.
(2006a), Ohara et al. (2007), Zhang et al. (2007), Klimont et al.
(2009) .Fig. 6 shows the evolution of the emissions of SO 2,N O xand
BC in Asia. It can be seen from this ﬁgure that the SRES A2 scenarios
show much higher emissions and seem to underestimate the
impact of the current legislation, especially for SO 2, while for NO x
also growth in transport demand was underestimated in the SRESA2 scenario. MFR scenarios suggest a large technical potential for
emission reduction after 2010 except BC where majority of emis-
sions originate from domestic combustion and end-of-pipe
measures are estimated to have only limited applicability within
considered time horizon.
Fig. 7 illustrates the estimated changes in emissions of SO
2and
NOxbetween 2000 and 2030 for a baseline scenario comparable to
the IIASA-CLE scenario ( Cofala et al., 2007 ), the basis for the
scenarios s used in the ACCENT model comparisons ( Stevenson
et al., 2006 ). The largest changes occur in the same areas, with
China and India showing a strong increase and Europe, North
America, and Japan a decline in emissions ( Akimoto, 2003 ).
Major uncertainties in emission inventories are associated with
inadequate knowledge of open biomass burning (forest ﬁres, agri-
culture waste burning), biofuel use (heating and cooking), artisanal
industry, residential combustion of coal, and agricultural produc-
tion systems. Due to a lack of comprehensive activity data, there is
a tendency to underestimate the emissions of these pollutants.
Uncertainties in inventories will vary by region, source, pollutantand inventory year. Uncertainty estimates for all world regions are
not available.
Uncertainties for individual pollutants differ also with the level
of experience of compiling an inventory, with reduced uncer-
tainties obtained over time. SO 2inventories have a long history in
Europe and North America and are considered relatively reliable in
those regions. Due to the short experience in compiling PM, BC, and
OC inventories and the lack of data on the distribution of tech-
nology types in key regions, these are even more uncertain. BC and
OC inventories have uncertainty ranges of /C025% to a factor of two
(higher for open burning) ( Bond et al., 2004 ). Typical reported
ranges of uncertainty estimates for Europe are: SO 2:/C65%, NO x:
/C614%, NMVOC: 10–39% and CO: /C632% ( EMEP, 2006 ). The TRACE-P
inventory ( Streets et al., 2003 ) estimated uncertainties in Asian
emissions that ranged from /C616% for SO 2and/C637% for NO xto more
than a factor of four for BC and OC. Within Asia, there was wide
variation among countries and regions, with emission uncertainties
in Japan being similar to those in Europe, and emissions in South
Asia having high uncertainty.
3.1.3. Future inventories from different sectors
The relative importance of different sectors for global anthro-
pogenic emissions in 2000 is presented in Fig. 8 (gaseous species)
and Fig. 9 (BC). The estimates are based on the GAINS model
calculations and for historical years are broadly consistent with the
EDGAR FT2000 ( van Aardenne et al., 2005 ) and Bond et al. (2004) .
The contributions shown in these ﬁgures can be markedly
different, however, for individual countries and regions and they
exclude international shipping and air trafﬁc. The ﬁgures also
show changes in the source structure in the CLE and MFR scenarios
for 2030. The change in size of the pie charts symbolizes1change
(increase or decrease) in emissions compared to the year 2000.

emissions of SO 2,N O x, and CO 2in nearly all scenarios, except for
2000 for NO xwhere the penetration of reduction measures in
transport sector was still relatively low in several world regions
leading to high emissions from this sector. It changes in the future
when relative contribution of emissions from transport declines
from over 50 percent in 2000 to about 40 percent in 2030. For CO 2
and SO 2, the industrial combustion share increases by few
percentage points from about 63 and 74 to 69 and 79 percent,
respectively.
Emissions of methane ( Fig. 8 ) are dominated by agriculture,
waste, and production and transmission of natural gas (the latter
two included in ‘‘Industrial processes’’). Growing demand for gas
leads also to increase in share of the latter sector in future emis-
sions; only in the MFR scenario effective control of losses reduces
its importance and makes agriculture even a more prominent
source.
Primary source of emissions of BC is combustion of solid fuels,
mostly biomass, in the domestic sector ( Fig. 9 ) representing over 60
percent of BC. Transport plays also an important role, especially for
BC due to diesel emissions, representing nearly 20% of total. Rela-
tively high share of industrial combustion in total emissions is
associated with assumptions of high emission factors for smallindustrial boilers (stokers) and furnaces used in the developing
countries.
4. Distribution and changes of chemical active greenhouse
gases and their precursors
Models and observations represent powerful tools to under-
stand past and current behavior of atmospheric constituents.
Observations by satellites, which have a global scale is of particular
importance for understanding large-scale distributions and trends.
Also, since we are considering chemical active greenhouse
compounds with signiﬁcant spatial and temporal variations, more
limited scale observations represented by surface and sonde
observations are necessary for understanding chemical processes
and their impact on the distribution. Prediction of future changes
due to emission changes and climate initiated atmospheric changes
(temperatures, dynamics, humidity, biospheric response), can only
be made if we have reasonable understanding of past and present
conditions. We need to know the non-linear responses in compo-
sition from emission changes caused by human activities, and the
behavior of the chemical active greenhouse gases (CH
4,O3, parti-
cles). Such knowledge helps us distinguish natural variability from
human-induced changes.
The number of observations available for global comparisons
have increased manifold during the last decade and includesatellite, airborne and surface observations ( Richter et al., 2004;
Levelt et al., 2006; Schoeberl et al., 2007; Oltmans et al., 2006 ). A
large number of model/measurement comparisons have been
performed, which clearly show that model performance and our
understanding of processes have improved ( Isaksen et al., 2005;
Textor et al., 2006; Kinne et al., 2006; Schulz et al., 2006; Hoor et al.,
2009 ). Models are also important for improving our understanding
of compounds with low spatial and temporal coverage in the
observations.
Future changes in the chemically active greenhouse gases and
particles are to a large extent dependent on the emission scenarios
adopted, which are based on assumptions of population growth,
technology development, implementation of environmental
measures to reduce emissions and economical growth. It is inter-
esting to note that growth in emissions since the turn of the century
from several sectors (e.g., air trafﬁc, ship transport) have exceeded
predictions made only a few years ago signiﬁcantly. Scenarios
commonly used in model predictions are the IPCC SRES scenarios,
the EDGAR and RETRO databases, and scenarios from the QUANTIFY
project for the transport sector, and particular databases or
scenarios for speciﬁc sectors like ship transport and regions like
South-East Asia. Unfortunately, there are not yet any common
accepted databases or scenarios for future adaption. A discussion of
future emission scenarios is given in Chapter 3.
4.1. Observations and analysis of greenhouse gases
and their precursors
4.1.1. Satellite observations
Satellite observations during the last decade of chemically active
compounds like ozone, methane, CO and NO 2have proven to be
particularly valuable for the validation of global chemical transport
models (CTMs), and for increasing our knowledge of key chemical
and physical processes in the troposphere. This improves our
capability to reproduce and assess the impact of man induced
emission changes ( Richter et al., 2004; Levelt et al., 2006; Schoeberl
et al., 2007 ). Such studies include the identiﬁcation of key source
regions, the quantiﬁcation of sources strengths, and the assessment
of changes and trends over past decades. The ﬁrst extended satellite
data set of observed tropospheric composition came from the
TOMS instrument ( Krueger, 1989 ), which was designed to observe
total ozone column but can be used to retrieve tropospheric ozone
columns.
The Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment GOME ( Burrows et al.,
1999 ) was the ﬁrst satellite instrument having enough spectral
resolution to observe ozone as well as some of its precursors (NO 2,
HCHO). These measurements were continued and extended with
the SCIAMACHY instrument ( Bovensmann et al., 1999 ) which has

capability, allowing CO, CH 4, and CO 2observations. More recently,
the OMI instrument ( Levelt et al., 2006 ) on the AURA platform and
the GOME-2 ( Callies et al., 2000 ) on MetOp add to the UV/visible
data record, with a high spatial resolution and improved coverage.
Using measurements in the IR spectral region, the MOPITT instru-
ment ( Drummond and Mand, 1996 ) has been observing CO in the
upper and middle troposphere since its launch in December 1999. A
number of other tropospheric species including O 3and several
hydrocarbons can also be observed in the upper troposphere by the
ACE instrument in solar occultation and in nadir from the TES and
IASI instruments. While the IR nadir observations provide some
degree of vertical information, they usually have low sensitivity to
the lowermost troposphere. However, they greatly extend the list of
observable species ( Clerbaux et al., 2009 and reference therein),
and allowing for night-time measurements. All of these datasets
are extremely useful in evaluating the modeling capabilities of
CTMs. In the next sections, some examples are given for CO,
methane and HCHO. Further discussion, on recent advances in
space borne observations of atmospheric composition and their
applications, is given in the paper by Laj et al. (2009) .
4.1.1.1. Methane. Methane (CH 4) concentrations in the atmosphere
have increased by at least 2.5-fold during the agro-industrial era
(the past 3 centuries) from about 700 ppb, as derived from ice
cores, up to a global average concentration of about 1770 ppb in2005 based on present-day surface monitoring networks. Satellite
observations of methane (CH 4) columns have become possible with
the measurements of the SCIAMACHY instrument ( Buchwitz et al.,
2005; Frankenberg et al., 2006 ). The measurements show the
hemispheric gradient, the seasonality and hot spots over rice
paddies and tropical rain forests. Overall the agreement between
satellite measured and modeled CH 4ﬁelds is good but there is
indication of a signiﬁcant underestimation of methane emissions
from tropical rain forests ( Buchwitz et al., 2005; Frankenberg et al.,
2005; Houweling et al., 2006 ), as seen in Fig.10 . A recent re-analysis
of the satellite data using improved spectroscopic data reduced the
difference ( Frankenberg et al. 2008 ).
4.1.1.2. Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2).Tropospheric NO 2columns have
been derived from measurements of several UV/vis satellite
instruments starting with GOME in 1995. As the lifetime of NO 2in
the lower troposphere is short, most of the NO 2is observed close to
the sources and satellite measurements have been used to derive
NOxemissions, both globally and for speciﬁc sources ( Beirle et al.,
2004; Konovalov et al., 2006; Martin et al., 2004; Muller and
Stavrakou, 2005; Richter et al., 2004 ). Although models represent
patterns of observed distributions, there are discrepancies that can
be linked to inaccuracies in missions. An example of such
discrepancies can be attributed to the de-noxiﬁcation of power
plant exhausts during summer in the Eastern US following emis-
sions regulations ( Kim et al., 2006 )(Fig. 11 ). Changes in NO x

time period August -November 2003 ( Frankenberg et al. (2005) ).I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5150emissions are particularly large in parts of China, as seen from
satellite observations ( Richter et al., 2005 ).
Comparisons of satellite NO 2measurements with model results
indicate a possible underestimation of microbial sources of NO x
(Bertram et al., 2005; Jaegle et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2007 ).
Furthermore, lightning NO xemissions derived from satellite
measurements are at the low end of other estimates ( Beirle et al.,
2006; Boersma et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2007 ) with potential
implications for ozone production.
4.1.1.3. Formaldehyde (HCOH). Satellite measurements reveal large
concentrations of HCHO over ecosystems emitting isoprene and
terpenes, in particular over tropical rain forests ( Chance et al.,
2000; Wittrock et al., 2006 ). The seasonal and inter-annual cycle
has been compared to models and good agreement was found in
many regions ( De Smedt et al., 2008; Palmer et al., 2003 ) (see also
Fig. 12 ) The observations have also been used to estimate emissions
of isoprene and other VOCs ( Abbot et al., 2003; Fu et al., 2007;
Stavrakou et al., 2008 ). Satellite observations show enhanced
formaldehyde distribution over regions affected by biomass
burning. Parallel inversion of HCHO and glyoxal (CHOCHO) has
conﬁrmed previous HCHO emission estimates but indicated a large
missing biogenic source for glyoxal, which must be secondary to
explain the satellite observations ( Stavrakou et al., 2009a,b ).
4.1.1.4. Carbon monoxide (CO). Comparisons of satellite CO obser-
vations from the MOPITT satellite instrument with models reveal
substantial differences ( Fig. 13 ). There is a large underestimate in
models of the Northern Hemisphere springtime maximum in CO.
A similar bias is seen in comparison with surface observations at
Northern middle and high latitudes ( Shindell et al., 2006 ), sug-
gesting that the discrepancy cannot be attributed purely to biases in
the satellite retrievals. Although all models show this bias, there is
nonetheless a large range of CO values in the various models.
Simulated CO is correlated with OH in the models ( Fig. 4.6 ). Some
models produce OH ﬁelds inconsistent with observational
constraints on OH, but even those models whose OH values are in
accord with observation-based estimates are biased in CO, sug-gesting an underestimate in current emission inventories of CO or
its hydrocarbon precursors. Indeed, in a recent study Pison et al.
(2009) , developed a data assimilation system and applied it to infer
CO emissions (for 2004), and came up with signiﬁcant higher global
emissions than currently used, indicating that underestimated CO
is a result of too low emissions. However, the large spread in
methane lifetimes in the models (a factor of two; Fig. 14 ) indicates
that there are also substantial uncertainties in our understanding of
the present-day oxidation capacity of the troposphere.4.1.2. Trends at surface stations
4.1.2.1. Ozone. Chemical transport models indicate that 60–85% of
the present ozone burden in the troposphere results from chemical
production in the troposphere. ( Fusco and Logan, 2003; Lelieveld
and Dentener, 2000 ). Comparisons of present ozone concentrations
with values at a few stations in the Northern Hemisphere making
continuous measurements in the late 19th century and early 20th
century suggest that surface ozone approximately doubled over the
last century ( Vingarzan, 2004 ). For the last two to three decades the
global picture obtained from observations is not uniform. In general,
the increases are larger from the 70s to mid- 80s than in recent
years with a more mixed picture. Fig. 15 shows ozone background
trends at northern hemispheric mid-latitude stations at the western
coasts of the United States and Europe as well as the high-altitude
site Jungfraujoch. At the low altitude station, the background
conditions were carefully selected ( Parrish et al., 2008 ). Ozone
concentrations have consistently increased at some background
stations in Europe and the US since the 1950s. European stations
show an increase until the year 2000 from when on the concen-
trations remained constant. At the west coast of the US the ozone
concentrations are still increasing in air coming from the marine
boundary layer. For northern hemisphere mid-latitude stations
observations are determined by trends in emission in the source
regions. The increase in the 1990s is likely to be affected by large
changes in stratospheric ozone concentrations ( Isaksen et al., 2005;
Ordo´n˜
ez et al., 2007 ).Large increases in emissions in Asia and from
ocean going ship during the last 10 years can probably explain some
of the increases at the west coasts of the US and Europe (ship
emissions) ( Dalsøren et al., 2009a; Dalsøren et al., 2009b ).
Stations in different areas of the world might show different
trends. Observations in the eastern Mediterranean over a 7 year
time period (1997 to 2004) show a signiﬁcant decline in surface
ozone of 3.1%/year, reﬂecting the inﬂuence of transport from
continental Europe with declining emissions of ozone precursors
(Gerasopoulos et al., 2005 ). Observations from Northern Canada
and the South Pole show a decline both at the surface and in the
free troposphere ( Logan, 1998; Vingarzan, 2004; Oltmans et al.,
2006 ). This might be linked to decreased ozone ﬂux from the
stratosphere ( Oltmans et al., 2006 ), or it could be a result of solar
ﬂuxes penetrating to the troposphere where enhanced ﬂuxes seem
to reduce ozone in pristine background areas ( Isaksen et al., 2005 ).
Observational record from other areas in the Southern Hemisphere
is sparse with no clear trends ( Vingarzan, 2004; Oltmans et al.,
2006 ). On the other hand, ship-borne measurements in the Atlantic
byLelieveld et al. (2004) for the period 1979 to 2002 show signif-
icant regional increases, with increasing fossil fuel and biofuel use
in Africa as the main source of this trend.

WRF-Chem updated emission case runs. From ( Kim et al., 2006 ).I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5151Ozone increases since preindustrial time are reproduced by
models ( Berntsen et al.,1997; Wang and Jacob,1998; Stevenson et al.,
1998; Mickleyet al.,1999; Hauglustaine and Brasseur, 2001; Shindell
et al., 2003; Wong et al., 2004; Lamarque et al., 2005; Gauss et al.,
2006 ), using current and pre-industrial emissions, although models
tend to overestimate ozone for the pre-industrial period.
As part of the EU RETRO project (ECHAM5-MOZ, LMDz-INCA)
model studies of the long-term trends for the last 40 years of the
20eth century were performed. In addition, time slice studies for
speciﬁc years were performed (OsloCTM2 and p-TOMCAT). All
models gave signiﬁcant tropospheric ozone burden increases
during the time period studied. The mean year-2000 tropospheric
lifetime calculated by these models are in good agreement with the
multi-model mean estimate of 22.3 /C62.0 days of Stevenson et al.
(2006) . Other model studies investigating shorter time periods,
(Karlsdo ´ttir et al., 2000; Lelieveld and Dentener, 2000;Granier et al.,2003; Jonson et al., 2006 ) were able to reproduce some of the
observed ozone trends.
Fusco and Logan (2003) made a thorough estimate of tropo-
spheric ozone distribution and trends. They concluded that surface
emissions of NO xhave had the largest effect in the lower tropo-
sphere at northern mid-latitudes since 1970. The large emission
increase and efﬁcient outﬂow from Asia makes China responsible
for 30% of the increase at mid latitudes. Methane levels could
explain 25% of the global ozone trends. Although reduced strato-
spheric ozone lead to a 30% decrease in cross-tropopause ﬂux
giving signiﬁcant decreased ozone in the upper and middle
troposphere, little impact on surface ozone was found in the
summer and fall.

about 700 ppb constrain the current ratio of global natural

implies that the present-day anthropogenic emissions exceed
300 Tg yr/C01compared to total emission of 500–600 Tg yr/C01.
Wetlands dominate the natural methane emissions and hydrology
changes driven by meteorological variability, climate change(e.g., thawing permafrost), and/or anthropogenic activities (e.g.,
drainage, deforestation) may have induced signiﬁcant changes.
However, even the sign of such changes is still unknown. While
higher arctic temperatures are assumed to increase high-latitude
emissions, tropical wetland areas are likely diminishing by rapid

understanding, e.g., in relation to northern peat lands ( Wania,
2007 ) and gas ebullition from northern lakes ( Walter et al.,
2006a,b ). Based on pre-anthropogenic methane levels and frac-
tionation present-day total natural emissions are likely to exceed
200 Tg yr/C01. New estimates on methane soil consumption amount
to 28 (9–47) Tg yr/C01(Curry, 2007 ).
Global methane monitoring networks include the in situ
networks of NOAA-GMD and ALE-GAGE-AGAGE, and the NDACC
FTIR network. The longest records currently span about 25 years.
Fig. 16 shows the NOAA GMD surface measurements from 1984
until 2007, and the yearly variability in changes in global methane.
The long-term methane growth rate has decreased markedly since
the early 1990s, with periods of nearly constant global concentra-
tion levels as is seen during the ﬁrst years of the 21st century. The
possible causes of this leveling off are subject of intense scientiﬁc
debate. On top of the declining trend anomalous events such as in
1991–1993 (ascribed to the Pinatubo eruption) and 1997–1998
(ascribed to an exceptional El Nino) have caused ﬂuctuations in the
annual growth rate in response to annual emission anomalies of the
order of 10 to 20 Tg.
Atmospheric inversion is a powerful tool to convert atmospheric
measurements into estimates of surface emissions. Estimating
surface emissions using atmospheric measurements in combina-
tion with a CTM and prior estimates of sources and sinks is an
efﬁcient approach. This top–down approach is increasingly used
also for reactive trace gases ( Hein et al., 1997; Petron et al., 2004;
Bousquet et al., 2005; 2006 ;Chen and Prinn, 2006 ). Using an
inversion model, Bousquet et al. (2006) analyzed the large atmo-
spheric variations of the growth rate of methane in terms of surface
emissions. They found that natural wetlands are largely dominating
the inter-annual variability over the 1984–2003 period. Emissions
due to biomass burning have an impact on inter-annual variability
only during the strong El Nin ˜o of 1997–1998. The study of Bousquet
et al. (2006) has shown that inverse modeling represent a useful
supplement to other estimates of methane emissions that can
reduce uncertainties associated with methane trend studies.
4.1.2.3. Carbon monoxide (CO). CO plays a key role for tropo-
spheric oxidation since the reaction with OH represents the main
loss of OH. Studies has shown that since 1980 there has been large
regional differences in the emission trends, and some regions like
Europe succeeded in implementing efﬁcient abatement measures(Monks et al., 2009; Olivier et al., 2003; EPA, 2003; EMEP, 2004;
Dalsøren et al., 2007 ). Northern Hemisphere (NH) CO observations
indicate an increase of about 1% year/C01from the 1950s until
the late 1980s, which are consistent with increased emissions
(Novelli et al., 2003 ). Methane oxidation represents an important
source of CO, particularly in unpolluted regions, and is likely to
have contributed to the observed increase. There were no evident
trends for the only available station in the Southern Hemisphere
(SH). The recent regional reduction in emissions seems to be
a likely explanation for measured CO decreases in the U.S. and
Europe ( EPA, 2003; EMEP, 2004 ). Anomalous declines in global
concentrations were found for the period 1991–1993 and are
likely explained by an OH increase after the eruption from Mt
Piantubo in 1991 ( Novelli et al., 1998 ). Large enhancements were
observed due to unusually large emissions from vegetation ﬁres
during the 1997–1998 ENSO period.
4.1.2.4. OH distribution and trend. Long-term trends in global OH
will have a signiﬁcant impact on methane lifetime and thereby on
the global methane trend. Changes in global OH will to a large
extent be determined by the ratio of global NO xto CO emissions
(Dalsøren and Isaksen, 2006 ), with enhanced NO emissions leading
to enhanced OH, while enhanced emissions of CO as the main
controller of OH, leading to reduced global OH.
Common to all model based studies is an overall high uncer-
tainty in estimating OH trends. There are numerous studies of
recent global OH changes. Lelieveld et al. (2002) conclude a 60%
increase of the overall oxidation capacity during the last century. In
contrast to this, Lamarque et al. (2005) found an overall decrease of
the OH burden by 8% from 1890 to 1990. Dalsøren and Isaksen
(2006) investigated the changes of OH (as well as the changes in the
lifetime of methane) from 1990 to 2001 emission changes with
a chemistry-transport model (Oslo CTM2) and found an average OH
increase of 0.08%year/C01over this time period.
Measurement campaigns with newly developed techniques to
directly measure OH provide important insight into the chemical
mechanisms more or less representative for a speciﬁc region or
chemical regime (e.g., Kleffmann et al., 2005; Berresheim et al.,
2003; Smith et al., 2006; Emmerson et al., 2007; Bloss et al., 2007;
Lelieveld et al., 2008 ). The most widely used ‘tracer of opportu-
nity’ to determine global OH is the purely man made methyl
chloroform (MCF, 1,1,1-trichloroethane). It is not quite clear how
long MCF can still be measured, since it is currently fading out

different oxidation processes in the atmosphere could affect the
OH distribution signiﬁcantly. For instance: It has been shown by
Cariolle et al. (2008) that simulated OH is signiﬁcantly affected,
when the results from a recent laboratory study by Butkovskaya
et al. (2007) are included, which show that a small fraction of the
NOþHO2yields HNO 3.
4.2. Modeling future changes
The relatively short atmospheric lifetime of chemically active
compounds like O 3and secondary aerosols, and pronounced spatial
variability of their impact, make it necessary to consider carefully
differences in regional development in future emission scenarios.
The Atmospheric Composition Change European Network of
Excellence (ACCENT) PhotoComp inter-comparison ( Dentener et al.,
2006b; Dentener et al., 2006c; Stevenson et al., 2006; Shindell et al.,
2006 ) is the most comprehensive study, which evaluates the role of
emissions and climate change until 2030. These papers describe
results from up to 26 different global models that participated in
the ACCENT study.
4.2.1. Tropospheric ozone
In the ACCENT study of ozone changes in 2030 three emissions
scenarios was selected to illustrate possible impact of emission
changes (climate change not included): An upper estimate was theoriginal IPCC SRES A2 scenario ( Nakicenovic et al., 2000 ), a central case
the IPCC B2 þIIASA-CLE (current legislation) scenario (hereinafter
B2þCLE), whilst a lower case was the IPCC B2 þIIASA MFR
(maximum feasible reduction) scenario ( Dentener et al., 2005; Cofala
et al., 2007 ; hereinafter B2 þMFR). The scenarios represent the range
of possible anthropogenic emissions in the near future. In an addi-
tional ACCENT PhotoComp experiment the potential impactof climate
change on O 3by 2030 was studied, using a subset of 10 models.
A summary of the results for tropospheric ozone from the ACCENT
PhotoComp study is given in Stevenson et al. (2006) .I ti ss h o w nt h a t
the evolution of anthropogenic emissions has a strong impact on
tropospheric ozone in 2030. Under the high growth, unregulated A2
scenario, tropospheric ozone increases signiﬁcantly at northern mid
latitudes with peak changes over SE Asia, where annual tropospheric
column (ATC) increases approach 10 DU (1 DU ¼2.67/C21016mole-
cules cm/C02)(>20% increases over year 2000). On the other hand,
under the highly regulated B2 þMFR (Maximum Feasible Reduction)
scenario, ATC is reduced by 3–4 DU over much of the continental
Northern Hemisphere. The central scenario, with B2 socioeconomics
and full implementation of year 2000 legislation (B2 þCLE), shows
increases with ATC peaking at 5 DU over S. Asia.
Emission changes could have signiﬁcant impact on surface ozone,
with large regional variations. Seasonal mean changes in surface O 3
between 2000 and 2030 for June, July, August (JJA) from the ACCENTstudy are shown in Fig. 17 . June, July, August is generally the
maximum surface O
3season at polluted northern mid-latitudes,
Fig. 16. Global methane time series from the NOAA ESRL network.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5155whereas at other locations ozone reaches a maximum in different
seasons. In particular, decreases in surface ozone up to 25 ppb can be
achieved under the B2 þMFR emission scenario while ozone is
predicted to increase by up to 25 ppb in some regions in the A2
emission scenario. The effects of climate change in 2030, while
uncertain, are small, compared to potential effects of emission
changes. The ACCENT modeling studies show that O 3in 2030
depends in particular NO xemissions, but also CH 4, CO and NMVOC.
Therefore, 2030 O 3levels are largely determined by emission control.
In a recent study organized by the Royal Society ( Royal Society,
2008 ) several new model simulations were performed to evaluate
the relative roles of changes in emissions and changes in climate
slightly further into the future (2050) when the effects of climate
change on O 3should be larger and more easily detected. Fig. 18
shows the change in seasonal mean surface O 3projected under the
new 2050 B2 þCLE emissions scenario, relative to the year 2000.
Most regions show reduced or near constant O 3concentrations by
2050 due to lower future emissions, with improved air quality over
much of the developed world. Over the North-East US in the
summer, O 3is reduced by up to 15 ppb. There are also substantial
reductions over Europe and Japan. Ozone is generally reduced
across most of the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes by about
5 ppb. One exception is during northern winter, when reduced NO x
emissions result in higher O 3levels over Europe and North America.
This is due to the reduced titration of O 3by NO. In some parts of
Asia and Africa where there is very little current legislation in place
and where signiﬁcant economic growth is projected, increases in O 3
of up to 3 ppb are expected.
Fig. 19 summarizes global annual mean surface O 3values for the
various scenarios and time horizons considered in the Royal Society
study ( Royal Society, 2008 ), the ACCENT PhotoComp study ( Den-
tener et al., 2006 b;Stevenson et al., 2006 ), and from the IPCC Third
Assessment Report ( Prather et al., 2003 ). The B þCLE and, in
particular, the B2 þMFR scenarios represent relatively successful
futures in terms of emissions control policies. The A2 scenario
represents a policy fail situation which demonstrates that back-
ground O 3levels will increase through the next century if NO x,C H 4,CO and NMVOC emissions rise ( Prather et al., 2003 ) and control
legislation is not implemented. This is illustrated by the potential
range of O 3values in 2100 given in Fig. 19 and represents the
response of surface O 3to the full range of IPCC SRES scenarios, as
estimated by Prather et al. (2003) . The high end of this range
represents scenarios with very high emissions of O 3precursors,
such as A2 and A1FI. Conversely, the low end represents the more
optimistic SRES scenarios, such as B1 and A1 T. Note that the IPCC
considered each scenario equally likely.
There have been several recent regional modeling studies which
considered future O 3levels over Europe ( Langner et al., 2005, Szopa
et al., 2006 ,Van Loon et al., 2006 ,Vautard et al., 2006 ), over
N. America ( Hogrefe et al., 2004, Tagaris et al., 2007; Wu et al.,
2008a ), and over E. Asia ( Yamaji et al., 2008 ). The regional studies
together with the global model results presented above which
provide regional information albeit on a coarse horizontal resolu-
tion (w200 km), demonstrate that future changes in surface O 3will
be spatially heterogeneous, with different drivers in different
regions and seasons.
Several studies show that enhanced hemispheric background O 3
in the coming decades will potentially offset efforts to improve
regional air quality via reductions in ozone precursor emissions
(Collins et al., 2000; Bergin et al., 2005; Dentener et al., 2005;
Derwent et al., 2006; Keating et al., 2004; Solberg et al., 2005;
Szopa et al., 2006; Yienger et al., 2000 ). Control of emissions on
a global scale is needed.
4.2.2. Projections of OH and CH 4
Over a long time horizon (a period of several decades) methane
trends might be strongly affected by changes in the OH distribution.
In a coupled climate–chemistry model simulation, Stevenson et al.
(2005) found that the expected increase in temperature will
increase humidity and result therefore in an increased OH abun-
dance in 2030. The increasing oxidation from enhanced OH will
increase aerosol formation and concentration, leading to domi-
nantly negative climate–chemistry feedbacks (less O 3, more OH,
a shorter CH 4lifetime, and more aerosols). This is also in
Fig. 17. The mean change in surface O 3(ppb) between 2000–2030 for the period June-July-August (JJA) from the ACCENT PhotoComp study ( Dentener et al., 2006a; Stevenson et al.,
2006 ). The top left panel shows the mean change in surface O 3under the B2 þCLE scenario; the top right panel under the B2 þMFR scenario; and the bottom left under the A2
scenario. The bottom right panel shows the mean change in surface O 3due to climate change. The results presented are the ensemble mean of 26 models.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5156accordance with the CCM study of Lamarque et al. (2005) ,p r e -
dicting a warmer and moister climate with a higher OH abundance
under reduced aerosol (precursor) emissions. Note that production
of secondary organic aerosols by ozone, which is not included,
could alter these results. However, since O 3is driving the produc-
tion of secondary biogenic volatile organics it is unclear what the
overall effect will be.
Future projections of CH 4depend on the evolution of its sources and
sinks. Estimates of anthropogenic CH 4sources are available for a rangeof future scenarios ( Nakicenovic et al., 2000 ). CH 4has also signiﬁcant
natural sources. Some of these (in particular, wetlands) are strongly
linked to climate change ( Gedney et al., 2004; Shindell et al., 2004 ).
A study by Stevenson et al. (2005) for the period 1990–2030
following the B2 þCLE emissions scenario, with the climate forced
by the IS92a scenario showed a CH 4growth to 2088 ppb in 2030
when climate change was not considered, but only a growth to
2012 ppb when it was included. Dentener et al. (2005) additionally
report that using the same modeling set-up, CH 4levels in 2030
were 1760 ppb for the B2 þMFR scenario (unchanged from 2000).
These values, together with the A2 value from IPCC TAR (2163 ppb),
were used as boundary conditions in the ACCENT PhotoComp 2030
scenarios ( Stevenson et al., 2006 ).Stevenson et al. (2006) showed
that the CH 4lifetime under different 2030 scenarios responded in
generally similar ways across 21 different models ( Fig. 20 ). The
results (from 10 models) all indicate that climate change will lead to
a reduction of CH 4lifetime. However, the absolute value for the CH 4
lifetime is more variable between models, which will havea signiﬁcant bearing on the future evolution of CH
4.
4.3. Aerosol distribution and interaction
4.3.1. Aerosol trends
Deep ice core drillings allow the identiﬁcation of pre-industrial
concentration levels of key aerosol components. The anthropogenicenhancement of these concentrations in the most recent snow
deposits as compared to the preindustrial levels, which are signiﬁcant
for the main aerosol components, can be regarded as the minimum
perturbation of aerosol levels in the atmosphere. The perturbation of
the average global atmosphere is likely to be larger since glaciers are
located far from major anthropogenic source regions and thus reﬂects
the diluted state of the perturbed atmosphere.
Sulfate concentration levels increased from preindustrial levels
by a factor of about 4 in 1980 at Greenland and the Canadian Arctic
(Legrand et al., 1997; Goto-Azuma and Koerner, 2001 ). Ice cores in
the Alps show larger increases due to the proximity of the European

crosses are model results simulated with a future climate, as well as a future emissions
scenario (the 2030 emissions scenario is the central one: B2 þCLE). These show a small
negative impact of climate change on global annual mean surface O
3(see Section
5.2.2 ). All other model simulations used a year 2000 climate. The bar shown for 2100 is
the estimated range of O 3responses to the full range of SRES scenarios, as reported by
Prather et al. (2003) (from Royal Society, 2008 ; their Fig. 5.5 ).I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5157sources. Nitrate levels in the Arctic from anthropogenic emissions
have increased by a factor of 2–3 between 1950 and the 1980’s
(Goto-Azuma and Koerner, 2001 ). Ice core observations show that
current BC levels exceed the 18th century levels by a factor 2
(McConnell et al., 2007 ).
Systematic surface measurements of in-situ aerosol properties
such as aerosol extinction, absorption, aerosol composition and
concentration and wet deposition have been analysis of recent
trend. Quinn et al. (2007) report recent trends in aerosol sulfate at
Alert, Alaska which show a signiﬁcant decrease from 1982 to 2004.
Peak black carbon levels at the same location decreased between
1990 and 2000, while absorption at Barrow shows almost no trend
between 1990 and 2005.
Major technology developments are expected to lead to a shift
in future emissions with a larger fraction emitted in tropical regions
with higher levels of black carbon, primary organic particles and
organic aerosol precursors and aerosol loads ( Ramanathan and
Carmichael, 2008 ).
4.3.2. Comparisons of aerosols and their precursors
Surface networks from which we can infer information about
the global tropospheric distribution of aerosols make use of
a diverse set of instruments with subsequent chemical analysis and
mass weighting procedures (see Laj et al., 2009 ). The diversity of
the instruments and the spatially unbalanced global distribution of
sites with aerosol instrumentation have made satellite retrieved
aerosol distributions a major source of information when it comes
to describing the global distribution of aerosols. Calibration and
precision of the satellite retrieved aerosol optical depth have
improved over time with an important increase of available data
over land and sea since the late 90’s with the launch of satellite
instruments such as POLDER, MODIS, MISR and CALIOP. Conﬁdence
in their products has been established through the synchronous
deployment of ground-based sun photometers (AERONET, GAW,
SKYNET, PHOTONS) and lidar systems (EARLINET, MPLNET). Note
that the optical instruments can only retrieve the bulk property of
column aerosol optical depth or extinction proﬁles which is
ambiguous with respect to underlying aerosol composition and
size. Intensive in-situ measurements of chemico-physical proper-
ties of the aerosol are being frequently used to interpret remote
sensing products. The performance of state of the art global aerosol
models and other satellites against the bulk aerosol optical depth
derived from the satellite MODIS are shown in the Taylor diagraminFig. 21 . Considerable scatter of performance can be observed,
while the median model outperforms individual models and some
other satellite retrievals. Efforts continue in AEROCOM to under-
stand the differences and hence uncertainty in simulated aerosol
optical properties. For details about the comparisons, see Kinne
et al. (2006) and Textor et al. (2006) .
4.3.3. Diversity of simulated aerosol loads
Simulation of the global aerosol distributions suggest that the
major contributors to global aerosol mass are dust and sea salt.
Anthropogenic emissions contribute to the formation of secondary
aerosol components such as sulfate, organic matter, soot and
nitrate. Fig. 22 depicts the global simulated mass distributions for
the major aerosol components, given as a median from nine models
participating in the AeroCom project ( Schulz et al., 2006 ). Note that
the creation of a median model smoothes the distribution. Due to
their short atmospheric life-time global particle distribution can be
linked to the major source regions. From the distribution patterns
of the different aerosol components, one can also infer considerable
spatial variability in the aerosol composition.
Within the aerosol model inter-comparison initiative AeroCom,
a large range of parameters have been incorporated, including those
related to the mass balance, to optical properties and to the radiative
forcing (see for further details http://nansen.ipsl.jussieu.fr/
AEROCOM ). The initial documentation showed signiﬁcant and
large diversity for almost all investigated parameters ( Textor et al.,
2006, Kinne et al., 2006 andSchulz et al., 2006 . It is hard to explain
the differences found in mass burdens and optical properties ( Textor
et al., 2007 ). As an example of these ﬁndings, Fig. 23 illustrates the
global mass fraction of aerosol found above 5 km altitude in the
AeroCom models in different experiments. The ﬁve major aerosol

species. High fractions of sulfate mass above 5 km as compared tototal column sulfate are found in all models and point to the slow
production of aerosol sulfate in clouds and via OH oxidation. Surface
emissions of relative coarse sea salt and dust aerosol particles
translate into a relatively small sea salt and dust mass fraction in the
upper troposphere. The mass fractions for the different model
experiments of the same model are shown side by side to illustrate
the impact of changing emissions on the vertical distribution.
The diversity among models and the resemblance among model
experiments from a given model as documented by Fig. 23 withrespect to the average vertical transport have led to several
important conclusions: The current global models exhibit signiﬁ-cant and important differences in the vertical mixing of aerosol
mass. The way different species are affected by vertical mixing
processes is varying from model to model. The experiment with
harmonized emissions reveals that the internal structure of any
aerosol model was by far more important for the vertical mixing
and aerosol composition than the variations in spatial and temporal
emissions imposed through AeroCom. The larger diversity in black
carbon export from continental scale regions compared to that of
carbon monoxide could be linked to the uncertainty in wet removal

from the modeled distributions of 9 aerosol transport models.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5159and thus long-range transport of aerosols ( Shindell et al., 2008a,b ).
Other processes have been emphasized recently as possible source
of diversity, such as humidity growth ( Bian et al., 2009 ), meteoro-
logical drivers ( Liu et al., 2007 ) and different aerosol compositions
(Myhre et al., 2009 ). In general the recent works support the idea
that differences in radiative forcing originate from different model
constructions.
AeroCom comparisons documented considerable differences
with respect to parameterization of several processes, including
pole-ward transport, aerosol water mass, the split between large
scale and convective scavenging, absorption of visible light,
secondary sulfate formation, and radiative forcing related param-
eters. How these are couplings are achieved will have considerably
impact on studies of aerosol-climate feedbacks (see eg Carslaw
et al., 2009 ). It is clear that a systematic comparisons with obser-
vations, and more thorough analysis of the model structures is
needed to reduce the differences in the future.
4.4. Observed brightening and dimming trends over
the last 40 years
The major anthropogenic impact on climate occurs through
a modiﬁcation of the Earth’s radiation balance by changing the
amount of greenhouse gases and aerosol in the atmosphere. The
amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface is thereby
particularly important as it provides the primary source of energy
for life on the planet and states a major component of the surface
energy balance, which governs the thermal and hydrological
conditions at the Earth’s surface.
Observational and modeling studies emerging in the past two
decades suggest that surface solar radiation (SSR) is not necessary
constant on decadal timescales as often assumed for simplicity, but
shows substantial decadal variations. Largely unnoticed over
a decade or more, this evidence recently gained a rapid growth of
attention under the popular expressions ‘‘global dimming’’ and
‘‘brightening’’, which refer to a decadal decrease and increase in
surface solar radiation, respectively.Extensive measurements began in the late 1950s during the
International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957/58. Many of these
historic radiation measurements have been collected in the Global
Energy Balance Archive (GEBA, Gilgen et al., 1998 ) at ETH Zurich and
in the World Radiation Data Centre (WRDC) of the Main Geophysical
Observatory St. Petersburg. In addition, more recently, high quality
surface radiation measurements, such as those from the Baseline
Surface Radiation Network (BSRN, Ohmura et al. 1998 ) and from the
Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) have become
available. These networks measure surface radiative ﬂuxes at the
highest possible accuracy with well-deﬁned and calibrated state-of-
the-art instrumentation at selected worldwide selected sites.
4.4.1. Surface solar dimming from the 1960s to the 1980s
Changes in solar radiation from the beginning of worldwide
measurements in the early 1960s until 1990 have been analyzed in
numerous studies (e.g., Ohmura and Lang, 1989; Gilgen et al., 1998;
Stanhill and Cohen, 2001 and references therein; Liepert, 2002;
Wild, et al., 2004; Wild, 2009 and references therein). These studies
report a general decrease of solar radiation at widespread locations
over land surfaces between 1960 and 1990. This phenomenon is
now popularly known as ‘‘global dimming’’. Fig. 24 shows the
change in global dimming since 1950 for different locations.
Increasing air pollution and associated increase in aerosol
concentrations are considered a major cause of the measured
decline of surface solar radiation (e.g., Stanhill and Cohen, 2001 ).
Changes in cloud amount and optical properties have also been
proposed to contribute to the dimming (e.g., Liepert, 2002 ).Norris
and Wild (2007) differentiate between aerosol and cloud impact on
radiative changes over Europe. They show that changes in cloud
amount cannot explain the changes in surface insolation, pointing to
the aerosol direct and indirect effects as major cause of these vari-
ations. Alpert et al. (2005) found that the decline in surface solar
radiation in the 1960 to 1990 period is particularly large in areas with
dense population, which also suggests a signiﬁcant anthropogenic
inﬂuence through air pollution and aerosols. Several studies (e.g.,
Dutton et al. 2006 ) noted a dimming over the 1960 to 1990 period at
Fig. 23. Aerosol compound mass fraction found above 5 km altitude on global average. AeroCom A (original model state), B (present-day prescribed emissions) a nd P (preindustrial
prescribed emissions) experiments are shown if available. Model names for experiments B and P are expanded by experiment abbreviation.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5160remote sites, suggesting that the phenomenon is not of purely local
nature and air pollution may have far-reaching effects.
4.4.2. Surface solar brightening from 1980s to present
The studies on global dimming were all limited to data prior to
1990. ETH Zurich recently undertook a major effort to update the
worldwide measured surface radiation data in GEBA for the period
from 1990 to present. Wild et al. (2005) evaluated the newly
available surface observational records in GEBA and BSRN to
investigate the trends in surface solar radiation in the more recent
years. This analysis showed that the decline in solar radiation at
land surfaces seen in earlier data is no longer visible in the 1990s.
Instead, the decline leveled off or even turned into a brightening
since the mid 1980s at the majority of observation sites. This
brightening is not just found under all sky conditions, but also
under clear skies, pointing to aerosol as major cause of this trend
reversal ( Wild et al. 2005, Norris and Wild 2007 ). The trend reversal
is reconcilable with recently estimated radiation trends derived
from independent methods, such as satellite derived estimates and
the independent Earthshine method ( Pinker et al. 2005, Hatzia-
nastassiou et al. 2005, Palle ´et al., 2005 ). The transition from
decreasing to increasing solar radiation is in line with a similar shift
in atmospheric clear sky transmission determined from pyrheli-
ometer measurements at a number of sites ( Fig. 24 ).
In addition to the strong signals of major volcanic eruptions (such
as Pinatubo and El Chichon), a general tendency of decreasing
atmospheric transparency up to the early 1980s and a gradual
recovery thereafter were found ( Wild et al.,2005 ). The transition from
dimming to brightening is also in line with changes in aerosol and
aerosol precursor emissions derived from historic emission invento-
ries, which also show a distinct trend reversal during the 1980s,
particularly in the industrialized regions ( Streets et al., 2006b ).
The documented trend reversal in aerosol emission towards
a reduction and the associated increasing atmospheric transmission
since the mid 1980s may be related to air pollution regulations
and the breakdown of the economy in Eastern European countries(Wild et al., 2005; Streets et al,. 2006a ). The observed reduction of
black carbon and sulfur aerosol measured in the Canadian Arctic
during the 1990s is likely related to the decreased emissions in Europe
and the Former Soviet Union ( Sharma et al. 2004 ). Since 1990,
a reduction of aerosol optical depth over the world oceans was
inferred from satellite data by Mishchenko et al. (2007) .T h i sﬁ t sw e l l
to the general picture of a widespread transition from dimming to
brightening seen in the surface radiation observations at the same
time.
4.4.3. Impact of dimming and brightening on the climate system
A growing number of studies provide evidence that the vari-
ations in surface solar radiation have a considerable impact on the
climate system. Wild et al. (2007) investigated the impact of
dimming and brightening on global warming. They present
evidence that surface solar dimming was effective in masking and
suppressing greenhouse warming, but only up to the mid-1980s,
when dimming gradually transformed into brightening. Since
then, the uncovered greenhouse effect reveals its full dimension,
as manifested in a rapid temperature rise ( þ0.38/C14C/decade over
land since mid-1980s). Impacts of the global dimming and
brightening transition can be further be seen in glaciers and snow
cover retreats as well as an intensiﬁcation of the hydrological
cycle, which became evident as soon as the dimming disappeared
in the 1990s ( Wild, 2009 ).
Ramanathan and Carmichael (2008) estimate a reduced surface
solar radiation of 1.7 W m/C02due to BC. When including scattering
aerosols and the indirect aerosol effect, a reduced surface radiation
of 4.4 W m/C02has been estimated. Global aerosol models produce
weaker changes in the surface radiation ( Schulz et al., 2006 ) than
the observational based method used in Ramanathan and Carmi-
chael (2008) .Kvalevåg and Myhre (2007) show that other
components such as gases and contrails (direct and indirect effect)
contribute to the reduced surface solar radiation. It is further shown
that the reduction in surface solar radiation calculated by models
occurs mostly in industrialized regions, which could explain a large
part of the observed dimming.
5. Climate impact from emission changes
This section describes the climate effects related to the changes
in atmospheric constituents, including comparisons between the
components of the system and how to deﬁne the metrics for
mitigation purposes. Although various climate effects of aerosols
and greenhouse gases are discussed, focus will be on the atmo-
spheric components discussed in the previous chapters. Changes
in land surface properties are not considered here.
The use of the radiative forcing concept is the most common
way to compare the impact leading to climate change. This concept
is used because surface temperature changes from GCMs are clearly
model dependent ( Hansen et al., 1997; Shine et al., 2003 ). The
radiative forcing (RF) is deﬁned as the net change in the irradiance
(solar and terrestrial) at the tropopause after allowing the
temperature in the stratosphere to adjust to radiative equilibrium
(Forster et al., 2007 ). The surface and tropospheric temperatures
are held ﬁxed according to the deﬁnition and considered as
a response. The impact of the temperature changes on water vapor
and clouds, is for example considered as feedback.
For some of the aerosol effects the RF concept is particularly
challenging. This is illustrated in Fig. 25 showing some of the main
atmospheric aerosol effects. The direct aerosol effect and cloud
albedo effect can be calculated in a way where only the aerosol
abundance and cloud droplet sizes change, according to the radiative
forcing concept. In the case of the semi-direct aerosol effect and the
cloud lifetime effect (see Section 5.4), the calculation is much more
Fig. 24. Time series of annual mean atmospheric transmission under cloud free
conditions determined from pyrheliometer measurements at various sites in Russia(Moscow), Estonia (Tartu–Toravere and Tiirikoja, Switzerland (Payerne) and Japan(average of 14 site, from Wild et al. 2005 ).I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5161complex since not only atmospheric concentrations change, but
cloud distribution and properties, water vapor abundance, and lapse
rate as well as other factors may change. The uncertainties in the
quantiﬁcation of the semi-direct effect and the cloud lifetime effect
were the reason why only the direct aerosol and the cloud albedo
effect was quantiﬁed as radiative forcing mechanisms in IPCC AR4
(Forster et al., 2007 ). In this paper the semi-direct and the cloud
lifetime are treated as radiative forcing mechanisms and a quantiﬁ-
cation of these based on available research is attempted.
The applicability of the radiative forcing concept is that the
climate sensitivity relating surface temperature change, as
proportional to the radiative forcing is similar for various climate
forcing mechanisms. The climate efﬁcacy has been deﬁned as the
climate sensitivity of a climate forcing mechanism divided by the
climate sensitivity for CO 2(Hansen et al., 2004; Hansen et al., 2005;
Joshi et al., 2003 ). For most climate forcing mechanisms the climateefﬁcacy is close to unity (mostly in the range 0.8–1.2) ( Forster et al.,
2007 ). The largest deviations from unity of the climate efﬁcacy are
found for idealized experiments on black carbon ( Cook and High-
wood, 2004; Hansen et al., 1997; Hansen et al., 2005 ) which is
related to semi-direct effects. When considering the BC impact on
surface albedo of snow and ice, a high climate efﬁcacy is found
(Flanner et al., 2007; Hansen et al., 2004 ).
5.1. Radiative forcing from gases5.1.1. Well-mixed greenhouse gases
The total RF due to the well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGG)
in 2005 relative to 1750 is 2.63 W m
/C02(Forster et al., 2007 ).Fig. 26
shows the percentage contribution of the RF due to CO 2and other
WMGG compared to the total RF from WMGG for two past period
(preindustrial to current, 1998–2005) and the future. Estimates for
Fig. 25. Illustrations of the a) direct aerosol effect (with both anthropogenic scattering and absorbing aerosols), b) cloud albedo effect, c) semi-direct a erosol effect, d) and cloud

contribution of CO 2to the total WMGG RF in the future is evident
even in the B1 scenario with a smallest CO 2increase.
Total RF is expected to increase strongly during the 21st century.
CO2is expected to be the dominating contributor to the total
WMGG RF also in the future. The average global CO 2concentration
has increased to 384 ppm in 2007 and the RF is increasing at a rate
higher than 0.03 W m/C02yr/C01. It is worth to note that the RF due to
CO2accounts for 63% of the total RF from WMGG over the industrial
period. However, over the 1998 to 2005 time period, the increase of
0.2 W m/C02in the RF of CO 2is the same as the increase in the total
WMGG RF ( Forster et al., 2007 ).
The increased methane burden has contributed to about 20% of
the anthropogenic climate forcing by greenhouse gases since the
pre-industrial era (0.48 /C60.05 W m/C02;IPCC, 2007 ). An emission-
based assessment of the climate forcing of methane ( Shindell et al.,
2005 ) showed that methane emissions are responsible for most of
the increase in global tropospheric ozone, with minor contributions
attributed to the increase of CO, VOC and NO xemissions. From this
estimate the combined methane and tropospheric ozone forcing is
about 0.8 W m/C02, almost half of the present-day CO 2forcing of
1.66 W m/C02. Although the methane concentration increased
between 2006 and 2007 by 0.63%, this had a small impact on the RF.
Currently CFC-12 has the highest RF among the CFCs and has the
third highest RF of the WMGG (after CO 2and CH 4). The RF due to
N2O has been steadily increasing ( Forster et al., 2007 ) and, as
a result of more intensive agricultural practice, may enhance its
growth. Since the CFC-12 concentration has leveled out the last
years and is expected to decrease in the future the RF due N 2Oi s
expected to soon be the third largest among the WMGG.
The future IPCC scenarios show a spread of more than a factor of
ﬁve for anthropogenic CO 2emissions; in addition the impact of
future warming on the carbon cycle is uncertain. This indicates
large uncertainties in concentration changes ( Friedlingstein et al.,
2006; IPCC, 2007 ). A further uncertainty is caused by a recent
suggestion that increased ozone may reduce the vegetation uptake
of CO 2(Sitch et al., 2007 ). Additionally, global dimming and
changes in the direct and diffuse solar radiation at the surface may
impact the vegetation and thus the CO 2uptake ( Mercado et al.,
2009 ). Human activity has strongly altered the direct and diffuse
solar radiation at the surface ( Kvalevåg and Myhre, 2007; Mercado
et al., 2009 , see also Section 4.4).
5.1.2. Water vapor
Water vapor trends are signiﬁcant in the troposphere ( IPCC,
2007 ); they represent a feedback to the climate system). IPCC(2007) suggests an increase of 1.2%/decade for the 1988–2004
period, and an increase of the of the order of 5% over the 20th
century. As an illustration, Boucher et al. (2004) estimate a forcing
of 1.5 W m/C02per 1% increase in the current water vapor content.
Direct human inﬂuence on water vapor is linked also to human
practices such as through irrigation ( Boucher et al., 2004 )a sw e l la s
to change in vegetation ( Forster et al., 2007 ). However, these water
vapor changes are small and difﬁcult to quantify since they involve
feedback mechanisms through perturbations of the hydrological
cycle ( Forster et al., 2007 ).
The trend in the stratospheric water vapor content is highly
uncertain ( Randel et al., 2006; Scherer et al., 2008 )a n di t so r i g i ni sn o t
well established. A direct human inﬂuence on stratospheric water
vapor originates from the water vapor emitted by aircraft and by the
oxidation of increasing CH 4in the stratosphere. The radiative forcing
due to stratospheric water vapor increase from CH 4oxidation has
been estimated using two independent approaches by Hansen et al.
(2005) and Myhre et al. (2007a) . Calculated values of 0.07 and
0.08 W m/C02, are obtained respectively. The contribution of the
stratospheric water from aircraft exhaust is very small ( Sausen et al.,
2005 ), but may be non-negligible in the future ( Søvde et al., 2007 ).
5.1.3. Ozone
Within an ACCENT network study Gauss et al. (2006) applied
ten global chemistry models to evaluate RF from ozone changes
since pre-industrial time. The range of RF due to tropospheric
ozone changes obtained by the different models is almost a factor of
two. For stratospheric ozone changes, the sign of the RF varied
among the models. The differences in RF due to tropospheric ozone
changes were explained by signiﬁcant differences in the calculated
column tropospheric ozone changes ( Gauss et al., 2006 ). Differ-
ences in the RF from stratospheric ozone change result mainly from
differences in the vertical proﬁle of ozone in the tropics ( Forster and
Shine, 1997; Hansen et al., 1997 ). The crossover altitude from an
increase of ozone in the troposphere to a reduction in the strato-
sphere varies among the different models, from a level close to
the tropical tropopause to about 25 km ( Gauss et al., 2006 ).
This crossover altitude depends on the increase in the ozone
amount in the upper troposphere and the transport to the strato-
sphere. The causes to the differences in the ozone change between
the models in the upper troposphere are mainly a result of applying
different chemical schemes and parameterizations of boundary
layer processes and convection ( Gauss et al., 2006 ).
An indirect RF from ozone precursors emission, previously not
accounted for, is the impact on vegetation from ozone enhance-
ment, which has the potential to affect the carbon cycle. This
indirect effect is linked to ozone damage on plants and crops
resulting in smaller CO 2uptake and higher atmospheric CO 2
abundance ( Sitch et al., 2007 ). The indirect effect on RF from ozone
through this process could be of similar magnitude as the direct RF
from ozone changes (see Fig. 27 taken from Sitch et al., 2007 ).
5.1.4. NO 2
NO2strongly absorbs solar radiation, thereby contributing to RF.
Due to its short life-time, the distribution of NO 2is strongly
heterogeneous with highest abundances in industrialized regions.Substantial changes in its concentrations have occurred over the
past decade ( Richter et al., 2005 ). A ﬁrst estimate of RF due to NO
2
changes gives a value of 0.04 W m/C02(Kvalevåg and Myhre, 2007 )
and is less than 2% of the total RF of the WMGG.
5.2. Direct aerosol effect
In the AR4 IPCC report ( Forster et al., 2007 ) the total direct
aerosol effect was quantiﬁed with a best estimate of /C00.5 W m/C02,
Fig. 26. Percentage contribution of the RF from CO 2,C H 4, N2O, and halocarbons to the
total RF for 2 past time periods and 4 future SRES scenarios. The future scenarios arecalculated for the time period 2000 to 2100. All values are taken from Forster et al.
2007 with regard to past changes and IPCC (2001) for the future.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5163together with a rather large uncertainty range from /C00.9 to
/C00.1 W m/C02. The large uncertainty range results from signiﬁcant
differences between estimates from global aerosol models (see also
discussion in Section 4.3). Using a combination of models and
satellite observations Myhre (2009) show that the RF due to the
direct effect of aerosols is around /C00.3 W m/C02, and that the
uncertainty range can be halved compared to the estimate by IPCC
(Forster et al., 2007 ). In the global aerosol inter-comparison study,
AeroCom, nine models used identical emissions for calculations of
RF (Schulz et al., 2006 ); they obtained a mean of /C00.2 W m/C02and
an uncertainty range of 0.2 W m/C02.Schulz et al. (2006) summarized
also some earlier model studies, which gave similar results. Studies
based on observations estimate a much stronger RF for the total
direct aerosol effect, with values between /C00.8 and /C00.5 W m/C02
(Bellouin et al., 2005; Chung et al., 2005 ). This section presents
advances since the AR4 report in global aerosol models develop-
ment, and in our understanding of the differences between model
estimates and observational based studies.
5.2.1. Recent progress in estimates of the RF
Bellouin et al. (2008) have updated the simulation from Bellouin
et al. (2005) using new satellite data and performed additional
sensitivity simulations to investigate the difference between model
calculations and methods based on observations. The latest version
of the MODIS satellite retrieval, named Collection 5, is imple-
mented instead of the MODIS Collection 4 used in Bellouin et al.
(2005) . This decreased the RF from /C00.8 to /C00.65 W m/C02.I tw a s
further shown that the treatment of clouds was a key cause to the
difference between models ( Bellouin et al., 2008 ). It was also shown
that assumption of zero RF in cloudy region used in Bellouin et al.
(2005) is questionable. In Schulz et al. (2006) the RF in cloudy
region varied substantially among the global aerosol models.
Schulz et al. (2006) considered only sulfate, primary BC and OC
from fossil and biomass burning as anthropogenic aerosols.
Anthropogenic nitrate, secondary organic carbon (SOA), and dustwere not included and these three aerosol components are all
estimated to have a negative RF ( Forster et al., 2007 ). The diversity
of the RF estimates due to nitrate is large, from around /C00.2 to
/C00.02 W m
/C02(Adams et al., 2001; Bauer et al., 2007; Jacobson,
2001; Liao and Seinfeld, 2005; Myhre et al., 2009; Myhre et al.,
2006 ). The formation of nitrate particles is dependent on other
aerosol components and precursors in a complex way and is likely
the main reason for the large range in the RF due to nitrate. The
formation of nitrate in the ﬁne mode depends on the excess ofammonia and it is thus important to obtain a sufﬁciently low amount
of sulfate to allow for the formation of ammonium nitrate. Obser-
vations show an important land – sea contrast, where ﬁne mode
nitrate dominates over land and coarse mode nitrate dominates over
ocean ( Putaud et al., 2004; Quinn and Bates, 2005 ). The size of the
nitrate particles is important since coarse mode nitrate particles give
a weak RF while ﬁne mode nitrate generate a strong RF.
SOA particles were included in the Schulz et al. (2006) study, but
only a natural component was considered, while the anthropogenic
was not taken into contribution. Several global aerosol modeling
studies of SOA have been performed ( Chung and Seinfeld, 2002;
Henze and Seinfeld, 2006; Hoyle et al., 2007; Tsigaridis and Kana-
kidou, 2003 ). The results show that SOA constitute a signiﬁcant
fraction of the total organic matter and even dominate in certain
regions. Observations also show a dominance of SOA, when
compared to primary organic matter in industrialized regions
(Crosier et al., 2007; Gelencser et al., 2007 ).
As shown in Schulz et al. (2006) the spread in RF due to the
direct aerosol effect among the models is substantial even though
the emissions are similar. The diversity among the global aerosol
models is found to be more related to the parameterizations oftransport, removal chemistry, and aerosol microphysics than to the
aerosol emissions used in the models ( Textor et al., 2007 ).
Substantial differences in RF were also found using a single model,
with various meteorological input data ( Liu et al., 2007 ).
5.2.2. Atmospheric absorption by carbonaceous aerosols
Ramanathan and Carmichael (2008) estimate that the direct
aerosol effect of BC leads to a RF at the top of the atmosphere of
0.9 W m
/C02and a reduced radiation reaching the surface of
1.7 W m/C02. The estimate by Ramanathan and Carmichael (2008) is
based on a method using a combination of observations, satellite
retrievals, and models. It is important to note that the RF due to BC
is a result of fossil fuel as well as biomass burning changes. The
emission of BC from biomass burning is also associated with
emissions of organic matter and the net effect of these emissions is
a RF close to zero ( Forster et al., 2007; Schulz et al., 2006 ). The RF
due to BC is particularly strong in Asia ( Ramanathan and Carmi-
chael, 2008 ) and contributes to an enhanced solar heating rate in
the atmosphere ( Ramanathan et al., 2007 ).
The state of mixing of BC particles is important ( Fuller et al.,
1999; Haywood and Shine, 1995 ). The aerosol optical properties of
BC have been quantiﬁed and better constrained by observations
showing that aged BC is often coated with other aerosol compo-
nents; while more fresh BC particles often are not mixed with other
aerosol components (externally mixed) ( Bond and Bergstrom,
2006; Bond et al., 2006 ). Suggestions that OC can absorb at short
wavelengths in the solar spectrum ( Jacobson, 1999; Dinar et al.,
2008; Barnard et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2007 ), has not been quantiﬁed
in terms of solar absorption or RF.
5.3. Semi-direct effects of aerosols
The degree of absorption versus scattering by aerosols depends
on type and mixing state. Aerosol species that are efﬁcient
absorbers of solar radiation in the atmosphere are mainly BC, but
also, to some extent, mineral dust and some organic compounds.
An absorbing aerosol (e.g., soot) layer, as typically encountered in
the boundary layer, may therefore lead to a substantial radiative
heating in this layer and a corresponding reduction in the solar
radiation reaching the surface ( Kaufman et al., 2002; Ramanathan
et al., 2001 ). The term semi-direct aerosol effect was ﬁrst introduced
byHansen et al. (1997) . They investigated the effects of radiative
forcing in a global climate model (GCM) and found that the large-
scale cloud cover was sensitive to the amount of absorbing aerosols
Fig. 27. Indirect radiative forcing due to ozone on plants affecting the CO 2uptake for
‘high’ (red) and ‘low’ (blue) plant sensitivity to ozone (from Sitch et al. (2007) ). Direct
radiative forcing due to ozone is included as bars.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5164in the lowest model layers. A reduction in the low-level cloud cover
corresponds to a positive radiative forcing at the top of the atmo-
sphere (TOA), and thereby a warming of the Earth-atmosphere
system.
However, the concept of absorbing aerosols inﬂuencing clouds
had already been introduced by Grassl (1975) . In this study,
absorbing aerosols within cloud droplets and in cloudy air were
found to reduce cloud albedo and heat the cloud layer. Observa-
tional support for absorbing aerosols inﬂuencing cloud cover in the
Tropics was presented by Ackerman et al. (2000) , as a minimum in
trade cumulus cloud coverage was found in regions and seasons
where clouds were typically embedded in dark haze. Ackerman
et al. (2000) also presented large eddy-model (LES) simulations
showing that absorbing aerosols may reduce trade cumulus cloud
coverage by decreasing the boundary layer convection that drives
stratocumulus formation.
This triggered a number of model studies investigating the
semi-direct aerosol effect on a global scale. Some studies ( Lohmann
and Feichter, 2001; Jacobson, 2002; Cook and Highwood, 2004 )
found that absorbing aerosols decreased low-level cloud cover, in
agreement with Hansen et al. (1997) and Ackerman et al. (2000) ,
thereby reducing reﬂection of solar radiation and having a warming
effect on the climate. Others, e.g., Menon et al. (2002) and Penner
et al. (2003) , found the opposite. In Menon et al. (2002) absorbing
aerosols increased large-scale cloud cover. Penner et al. (2003)
pointed out that the injection height of the absorbing aerosols is
crucial for their effects on clouds, possibly explaining the appar-
ently contradicting results arising from different GCM studies. The
importance of the vertical structure of the absorbing aerosols for
the semi-direct aerosol effect was also pointed out by Johnson et al.
(2004) . In LES model simulations of marine stratocumulus, they
found absorbing aerosols located in the boundary layer to increase
cloudiness, while the opposite was true for aerosol absorption
above the clouds.
Stuber et al. (submitted for publication) performed idealized
simulations with absorbing aerosols at different levels in the
troposphere using two GCMs to investigate the robustness of the
responses. Inclusion of absorbing aerosols in the lower part of the
troposphere led to a surface warming, whereas absorbing aerosols
in the middle and higher troposphere caused a surface cooling in
both models. The GCM responses of absorbing aerosols clearly
show changes in the local cloud distribution and water content
(liquid and frozen) but also change in the instability of the tropo-
sphere. The climate sensitivity of absorbing aerosols was mostly
higher than for a doubling of CO 2. These idealized experiments
show that a realistic absorbing aerosol distribution may impact the
clouds and tropospheric and surface temperature in a complex way.
Further observational support for the semi-direct aerosol effect
was given by Koren et al. (2004) , based on satellite observations
from the MODIS instrument. Focusing on the Amazon basin they
found cloud cover to be anti-correlated with smoke optical depth,
and attributed this to absorption within the smoke layer, which
stabilized the boundary layer and reduced the moisture ﬂuxes from
the surface. In Denman et al. (2007) , the semi-direct aerosol effect
was summarized to correspond to a negligible or slightly positive
radiative forcing at the TOA.
In terms of radiative ﬂuxes at the TOA, the semi-direct aerosol
effect has been reported to be dominated by a more conventional
aerosol effect on clouds, where aerosols acting as cloud conden-
sation nuclei (CCN) increase cloud lifetime and coverage by
delaying precipitation release (i.e. the cloud lifetime effect, see
Section 6.4). However, a recent study by Koren et al. (2008) shed
new light on the roles of these competing effects. Based on
a theoretical framework and satellite observations from the MODIS
instrument, they reported that, while the cloud lifetime effectdominates the semi-direct aerosol effect in regimes with relatively
low aerosol optical depths (AODs), the opposite is true for larger
AODs. AOD was in this study taken as a proxy for both CCN and the
aerosol potential to absorb solar energy. The physical reason for this
transition was that, while polluted clouds are relatively insensitive
to further increases in CCN, there is no corresponding saturation
effect for aerosol absorption, which increases steadily with aerosol
loading. The study of Koren et al. (2008) uses satellite data over
Amazon, but a similar pattern for the relationship between AOD
and cloud cover is found in many regions in a global study using
MODIS data ( Myhre et al., 2007b ).Koren et al. (2008) challenged
the modeling community to test or incorporate this new concept in
cloud-resolving or global models.
5.4. Aerosol indirect effects
More than three decades ago, Twomey (1974) stated the ﬁrst
theory on how anthropogenic aerosols may inﬂuence climate
through their impact on clouds. According to this hypothesis, often
called the ﬁrst aerosol indirect effect, an increase in atmospheric
pollution will lead to an increase in cloud albedo, everything elsebeing equal. Since then, a number of hypotheses on how anthro-
pogenic aerosols may inﬂuence climate through clouds were pub-
lished. While some of the hypotheses have been studied
extensively using models, satellite data or laboratory experiments,
other hypotheses are new and controversial and have not yet been
sufﬁciently tested.
Current suggestions for possible aerosol indirect effects are:
1) The ﬁrst indirect effect or cloud albedo effect: in warm clouds,
anthropogenic aerosols increase the cloud albedo by acting as
cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), thereby increasing cloud
droplet number concentrations and decreasing cloud droplet
sizes in the case of constant liquid water content ( Twomey,
1977 and Section 2.1.2).
2) The second indirect effect or cloud lifetime effect: The
anthropogenic decrease in cloud droplet sizes causes a less
efﬁcient precipitation production, which could lead to
increased cloud lifetimes or increased cloud horizontal and
vertical extension ( Albrecht, 1989 ).
3) The cloud glaciation effect: Ice formation in clouds at temper-
atures above approximately /C035
/C14C occurs by the aid of so-
called ice nuclei (IN) (i.e. heterogeneous freezing). Such IN are
typically insoluble particles with crystalline structure. Candi-
dates are mineral dust, biological particles and soot ( Prup-
pacher and Klett, 1997 ). Soot particles are largely of
anthropogenic origin, so anthropogenic activity may have
introduced additional IN into the atmosphere. Such an increase
in IN would lead to an anthropogenic increase in freezing and
cloud glaciation (e.g., Lohmann, 2002 ).
4) The de-activation effect: A relatively new idea is that anthro-
pogenic sulfur coatings can potentially de-activate IN ( Girard
et al., 2004 ), or alternatively make them less efﬁcient in mixed-
phase clouds ( Storelvmo et al., 2008b; Hoose et al., 2008 ).
5) The thermodynamic effect: As large droplets freeze more
readily than small droplets ( Pruppacher and Klett, 1997 ), the
anthropogenic decrease in cloud droplet radius is expected to
counteract freezing (e.g., Rosenfeld and Woodley, 2000 ).
6) Aerosol indirect effects on cirrus: The formation of pure ice
clouds (i.e. cirrus) by homogeneous freezing of super cooled
aerosols may occur at temperatures below approximately
/C035/C14C. Although this freezing process can take place without
the aid of IN, the presence of IN may delay or entirely prevent
homogenous freezing, as heterogeneous freezing processes
may deplete water vapor to the extent that the high superI.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5165saturation required for the onset of homogeneous freezing are
not reached (e.g., DeMott et al., 1997 ).
Fig. 28 shows a schematic overview of how the above effects
inﬂuence precipitation, cloud microphysical properties and radi-
ation. Except from the deactivation effect, all of the above effects
were discussed in IPCC AR4, ( Denman et al., 2007 ) in light of
recent publications. Rather than repeating what was already
thoroughly discussed in IPCC AR4, we will here focus on aerosol
indirect effects, which have recently received particular attention
from the scientiﬁc community. The following sections review
recent publications on aerosol indirect effects, and are further
divided into sub-sections on warm and cold clouds, respectively.
In Section 5.4.2 , a discussion of the recent results and suggestions
of future studies required for increased understanding of aerosol
indirect effects, and ultimately the climate system, is given.
5.4.1. Aerosol indirect effects associated with warm clouds
As mentioned above, the aerosol indirect effect on warm clouds
is typically divided further into the cloud albedo effect and the
cloud lifetime effect. Both effects act to increase cloud albedo and
cool the Earth-atmosphere system by increasing the amount of
solar radiation reﬂected back to space. In IPCC AR4, the model
estimates of radiative forcing (i.e. the perturbation to the global
energy balance of the Earth/atmosphere system) associated with
the cloud albedo effect range from /C00.22 W m/C02to/C01.85 W m/C02,
with a best estimate of /C00.7 W m/C02(Forster et al., 2007 ). Low
estimates are associated with model simulations using empirical
relationships between aerosol mass and CDNC ﬁtted to satellite
data to estimate the cloud albedo effect (Ranging from
/C00.22 W m/C02to/C00.5 W m/C02). A recent study estimating the cloud
albedo effect from satellite data alone ( Quaas et al., 2008 ) gives an
even lower estimate of /C00.2/C60.1 W m/C02, suggesting that global
models are exaggerating the effect compared to satellite
measurements. Furthermore, based on ground-based remote
sensing at the Southern Great Planes, Kim et al. (2008) reported
that while the ﬁrst aerosol indirect effect could be observed in
adiabatic clouds, it was not readily observed in sub-adiabatic cases.
A possible explanation is that entrainment and mixing-processes
attenuate the effect. However, high uncertainties are associated not
only with model estimates, but also with satellite retrievals and
in-situ measurements.McComiskey and Feingold (2008) recently demonstrated how
measurements of aerosol-cloud interactions (termed ACI) differ
substantially among various observational platforms, leading to
radiative forcing that differ by several W m/C02for the same
anthropogenic aerosol perturbation in an idealized cloud case.
Storelvmo et al. (2009) analyzed the cloud albedo effect in the IPCC
AR4 models used for transient simulations of future climate. They
found that about 1.3 W m/C02of the 2 W m/C02spread in estimated SW
forcing for the year 2000 can be explained by the different empir-
ical relationships between aerosol mass and CDNC used to calculate
the aerosol indirect effect in the models.
The range of model estimates of the total anthropogenic aerosol
effect on warm clouds (i.e. both the direct and indirect aerosol
effects) range from /C00.2 W m/C02to/C02.3 W m/C02in IPCC AR4 (note
that this range is based on a slightly different set of model studies
than that of the cloud albedo effect) ( Denman et al., 2007 ). The
parameterization of auto conversion (i.e. warm-phase precipitation
formation) is crucial when calculating the aerosol lifetime effect in
the models. Many different parameterizations of auto conversion
are available in the literature, yielding precipitation rates that differ
by orders of magnitude for the same cloud liquid water content
(LWC) and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) (e.g.,
Sotiropoulou et al., 2007 ). Consequently, an increase in CDNC
caused by an anthropogenic aerosol perturbation can lead to
substantially different precipitation responses, depending on the
auto conversion scheme. Most, if not all, global climate model
(GCM) estimates of the cloud lifetime effect predict increased cloud
thicknesses and/or lifetimes as precipitation release is reduced in
response to anthropogenic aerosol perturbations.
Furthermore, it has been suggested that in the presence of giant
CCN (GCCN; typically large natural particles like sea salt and dust),
the effect of increased CCN concentrations on precipitation release
is signiﬁcantly reduced ( Feingold et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2006;
Cheng et al., 2007; Posselt and Lohmann, 2008 ). The GCCN initiate
coalescence and precipitation, and thereby have the ability to
trigger precipitation in otherwise non-precipitating clouds. To date,
most GCM estimates of the aerosol lifetime effect have restricted
themselves to warm stratiform clouds, despite several publications
(e.g., Rosenfeld (1999) based on satellite data and Wang (2005)
based on cloud-resolving modeling) suggesting a pronounced
aerosol effect on convective clouds. Menon and Rotstayn (2006)
provided the ﬁrst global radiative forcing estimate of aerosol effects
Fig. 28. Schematic of aerosol indirect effects on warm and mixed-phase clouds, originally published in Hoose et al. (2008) .I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5166on (warm) convective clouds, based on two GCMs (CSIRO and GISS).
Whereas the CSIRO simulations suggested an enhanced total
aerosol indirect effect when aerosol inﬂuences on convective
clouds were included, the opposite was true for GISS simulations.
Lohmann (2008) included aerosol effects on both warm and cold
stratiform and convective clouds, and found a slight reduction in
the total aerosol indirect effect due to aerosol inﬂuence on
convective clouds.
5.4.2. Aerosol indirect effects associated with cold clouds
Similar to aerosol effects on convective clouds, aerosol effects on
cold clouds have only very recently been included in global climate
models. The ﬁrst global estimate of the cloud glaciation effect was
provided by Lohmann (2002) , suggesting a reduced aerosol indirect
effect under the extreme assumptions that IN are present in
unlimited amounts compared to an atmosphere containing no IN at
all. A more elaborate study of the cloud glaciation effect was pre-
sented by Lohmann and Diehl (2006) , concluding that anthropo-
genic activity may lead to increased heterogeneous freezing and
thereby inﬂuence cloud lifetime and precipitation processes,
depending on the concentration and nature of the natural IN
present. Mineral dust and certain primary biogenic aerosol particles
(PBAPs) constitute natural IN in the atmosphere. While the impact of
including realistic dust mineralogy was tested in a GCM by Hoose
et al. (2008) , no GCM has so far included PBAPs. Although realistic
natural and anthropogenic IN concentrations are required for
simulations of aerosol effects on mixed-phase clouds, the interac-
tion of such particles with mixed-phase cloud microphysical
processes like the Bergeron-Findeisen (BF) process is as important in
this context. Such processes have typically been treated in a very
simplistic manner in GCMs. Recent in-cloud observations from the
high alpine research station Jungfraujoch ( Verheggen et al. 2007 )
shed new light on the BF process and its interaction with aerosols.
Further guidance on the BF process was given in terms of a theo-
retical framework presented in Korolev (2007) ; the implementation
of this theoretical framework in a global model was found to have
a strong impact on the simulated aerosol indirect effect ( Storelvmo
et al., 2008a ).
Girard et al. (2004) were the ﬁrst to test the hypothesis of IN de-
activation by anthropogenic sulfate in a modeling framework, using
a single column model to study arctic haze events. Assuming that
sulfur coatings deactivated the IN entirely, they found pronounced
impacts on precipitation rates and cloud radiative properties.
A partial de-activation of IN as a result of sulfate coatings was also
found in to recent modeling studies (in the ECHAM5 GCM ( Hoose
et al., 2008 ) and in the CAM-Oslo GCM ( Storelvmo et al., 2008b ).
Rather than assuming that a sulfate coating deactivates the IN
completely, both studies showed a shift of the IN from contact
freezing nuclei to immersion freezing nuclei. In contact freezing
mode, IN initiate freezing when colliding with cloud droplets. This
freezing mechanism becomes efﬁcient at relatively warm sub-zero
temperatures, but requires insoluble IN particles. Coatings typically
render IN slightly soluble, allowing them activate to form cloud
droplets. Thereafter they may initiate freezing of the droplet from
within (i.e. immersion freezing), but this freezing mechanism
becomes efﬁcient at lower temperatures. Although model studieshave so far focused on de-activation due to sulfate coatings, other
species may have the same coating effect. The fact that the efﬁ-
ciency of IN, such as mineral dust, may be reduced by physi-
ochemical transformation of other aerosol species has recently
been discussed in Baker and Peter (2008) . In summary, the
de-activation effect counteracts the cloud glaciation effect, and
which effect dominates in any given case depends on the concen-
tration of natural and anthropogenic IN, and the amount of
anthropogenic material available for IN coating.In a recent study, Penner et al. (2009) have shown that the effect
on cirrus clouds of emission of anthropogenic aerosols, for instance
from aircraft could have signiﬁcant impact and reversing the sign of
radiative forcing. Note that the results are preliminary, and further
studies need to be done before conclusion can be made.
5.4.3. Aerosol indirect effects associated with various cloud types
A recent and comprehensive report on aerosol pollution impact
on precipitation, produced by the International aerosol precipita-
tion science assessment group (IAPSAG) ( Levin and Cotton, 2007 ),
concluded that despite the progress made in recent years, pollution
effects on precipitation are not understood, neither on the scale of
a local storm nor on the global scale. Obtaining observational
evidence for pollution affecting precipitation release and cloud
lifetimes is challenging, and recent modeling results render not only
the magnitude but also the sign of this effect as highly uncertain.
However, ﬁndings in recent publications suggest that the effect of
incre ased aerosol concentrations on convective precipitation is to
a large extent determined by environmental parameters like the
unperturbed aerosol concentration or the relative humidity.
Fig. 29 gives an overview of the majority of global estimates of
the aerosol indirect effect. Evidently, the spread in estimates has
not decreased with time. On the contrary, estimates span a larger
range than ever, much due to the new aerosol indirect effects
recently taken into account.
5.5. Radiative forcing summary
In Chapter 5, new radiative forcing mechanisms are discussed
and quantiﬁed, as well as the increases in WMGG concentrations
affecting the RF estimates. Fig. 30 andTable 1 show estimates of the
RF for seven different types of climate forcing mechanisms over the
industrial era up to 2007. Only anthropogenic atmospheric
compounds are included. For anthropogenic climate forcing on
surface and natural climate forcing we refer to Forster et al. (2007) .
The WMGG dominates in terms of RF and consist of CO 2,C H 4,N2O,
and halocarbons. We group ozone, NO 2, and stratospheric water
vapor into a common class of short-lived gases (SL-G). These gaseshave quite variable lifetimes that are too short for them to be well
mixed in the atmosphere. Estimates for ﬁve groups of aerosol
effects are included in Fig. 30 . RF due to the direct aerosol effect and
the cloud albedo effect have been estimated earlier, but separate
estimates of the semi-direct aerosol effect and the cloud lifetime
effect have not been provided earlier ( Forster et al., 2007; Hansen
et al., 2005 ). We also discuss here an estimate for indirect aerosol
effects of mixed phase clouds.
6. Contributions to tropospheric changes from the transport
sector and for different regions
Several recent studies on the impact of emissions from the
transport sectors, in particular ship and aircraft have been per-
formed (Eyring et al., 2009; Hoor et al., 2009 ;Collins et al., 2009;
Dalsøren et al., 2009a ). Both sectors differ from land-based sectors.
A typical example of the differences is illustrated by emission from
ship trafﬁc. Ocean going ship types (e.g., bulk, oil transport,
container ship) have highly different ship tracks, with different
environmental impact, and highly different growth rates ( Dalsøren
et al., 2009a ). Furthermore, the climate impact from the different
transport sectors is different, which makes it necessary to treat
sectors individually.
Ships and aircraft have so far not been affected by international
policy measures to reduce emissions. Understanding and quanti-
fying the impact of ship emissions is particularly challenging sinceI.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5167the associated composition changes lead to large positive and
negative global climate forcings.
Recent regional differences in NO xemissions play a signiﬁcant
role in the atmospheric oxidation process and on the impact on
climate compounds like O 3and CH 4and oxidants like OH. For the
period 1996–2004 substantial reductions of NO 2were found over
Europe and the United States, corresponding to regional emission
decreases during this period, while emissions continued to increase
in developing countries and accelerated in some transition
economy regions, as demonstrated in Fig. 31 (Akimoto, 2003 ).
There has been a large increase in NO xemissions since pre-
industrial time, which have led to signiﬁcant increase in the
atmospheric nitrogen burden. Tsigaridis et al. (2006) estimate
a factor of global increase by a factor of 4. Galloway et al. (2004)
calculated an increase in the nitrogen oxide deposition from 12.8
Tg(N)year/C01in 1860 to 45.8 Tg(N)year/C01in the early 1990s. Using
emissions valid for 1992 and a critical load varying between
different natural ecosystems, Bouwman et al. (2002) estimated that
sulfur and nitrogen deposition exceeded critical loads over 7% of
the region covered by natural vegetation (See also Fowler et al.,
2009 ). Changes in modeled NO 2concentrations during the 1990s
qualitatively reproduce the different changes in regional emissions
(Granier et al., 2003 ). Large decreases are found over Europe and
Russia, smaller decreases are identiﬁed over western North Amer-
ica, and large increases in populated or industrialized areas in Asia
and parts of Latin America, which is in line with reported
emission trends in Fig. 31 . For further discussions on chemical
interactions of pollution emissions, in particular the regional
impact of compounds like NO x, CO, NMVOC and SO 2we refer to theaccompanying papers by Monks et al. (2009) and Fowler et al.
(2009) .
6.1. Composition change due to emission from the transport sectors
During recent years a strong focus has been on the atmospheric
impact from the transport sectors. Several ongoing EU projects
(ACCENT, QUANTIFY, ATTICA, ECATS) investigate the effects of aviation,
shipping, road trafﬁc and other land-based transport on the atmo-
sphere ( Eyring et al., 2007a ;Hoor et al., 2009 ;Eyring et al., in prepa-
ration, Dalsøren et al., 2007; Dalsøren et al., 2009a; Lee et al., 2009 ). The
focus in these projects is primarily on regional to global scales.
6.1.1. Studies of current impact
The European Integrated Project QUANTIFY has investigated the
impact of the various transport sectors on atmospheric composi-
tion and climate. A comprehensive model activity has evaluated the
impact of transport emissions on ozone, methane and the resulting
radiative forcing. Fig. 32 shows the combined effect of shipping,
aviation and road trafﬁc on column ozone. Perturbations are most
pronounced during the summer months in the Northern Hemi-
sphere, with local perturbations of 4% above the background levels,
although individual model increases can be larger.
Gas and particle emissions from ocean going ships are a signif-
icant and growing contribution to the total emissions from the
transportation sector. The EU ﬁnanced ATTICA project has pub-
lished a detailed review on the current state of research concerning
the effects of shipping emissions on atmospheric chemistry and
climate ( Eyring et al., in preparation ). Nearly 70% of ship emissions

through the formation of ground-level ozone, sulfur compounds
and particulate matter in coastal areas. Ozone and aerosol precur-
sors emitted to the atmospheres from ships are transported over
several hundreds of kilometers, contributing to air qualityproblems further inland. Fig. 33 shows satellite measurements of
NO2columns retrieved by the SCIAMACHY instrument over marine
areas ( Richter et al., 2004 ), revealing large impact of shipping in the
Indian Ocean, Eastern Mediterranean and coastlines in general, as
well as further inland.
Fig. 34 shows global ozone enhancements from the OsloCTM2
model for year 2000 due to ship emissions ( Dalsøren et al., 2007 ).
The signal clearly follows the conventional ship tracks, but also
affects continental areas. Calculations of ozone enhancements from
ship emissions by Endresen et al. (2003) give maximum ozone
perturbations of 12 ppb in the marine boundary layer during
summer over the northern Atlantic and Paciﬁc regions, while the
multi-model study described in Eyring et al. (2007a) using EDGAR
emissions obtained somewhat lower values, about 5–6 ppb, for the
North Atlantic. In an update on ship emissions and their environ-
mental impact, Dalsøren et al. (2009b) isolated the impacts of major
ship types and ports. The large and increasing contribution from
container ships was highlighted. In agreement with earlier studies, it
was found that ship emissions contribute signiﬁcantly to pollutants
like ozone, sulfate, nitrate, BC and OC aerosols. In another study,0,51,01,52,02,53,0

Fig. 30. Radiative forcing estimates of atmospheric compounds from the pre-industrial

et al. (2007) except that it has been taken into account that growth in RF due to CO 2is
0.03 W m/C02yr/C01between 2005 and 2007. Estimates for ozone and stratospheric water
vapor are similar to the value given in Forster et al. (2007) , whereas the estimate of
NO2of 0.04 W m/C02is from Kvalevåg and Myhre (2007) . The estimate of the direct
aerosol effect is from Myhre (2009) . The RF for the cloud albedo effect is calculated
based on Forster et al. (2007) , with the modiﬁcation that no model estimates have
been excluded based on the number of aerosol species treated in the various models.Additionally, estimates published after Forster et al. (2007) have also been taken into
account. While Forster et al. (2007) reported the median value of the estimates
considered, we here report the mean. However, the mean and median values differ byonly 2%. As few model studies report estimates of the cloud lifetime effect only, theestimate for cloud lifetime effect is calculated by subtracting the mean RF for the cloudalbedo effect from the mean RF for both the albedo and lifetime effect. The latter is
calculated based on studies reported in Denman et al. (2007) , in addition to recently
published estimates. This way of calculating the RF for the cloud lifetime effect relieson the assumption that the total (albedo and lifetime) effect equals the linear sum ofthe two separate effects to a good approximation (e.g., Kristja ´nsson, 2002 ). The few RF
estimates for aerosol effects on mixed phase clouds available in the literature suggesta potentially large effect, but so far model studies are inconclusive in terms of the sign
of this RF. Hence, we refrain from giving a RF estimate here, but rather give an
uncertainty range from /C00.5 W m
/C02to 0.5 W m/C02. The semi-direct effect is estimated
based on a combination of published results of realistic BC atmospheric distributions
and idealized experiments in Stuber et al. (submitted for publication) . The absorption
aerosol optical depth included in the idealized experiments in Stuber et al. (submittedfor publication) is 0.05, which is an order of magnitude larger than the total(anthropogenic and natural) absorption aerosol optical depth from global aerosolmodels ( Kinne et al., 2006 ). All the RF from the idealized semi-direct aerosol effect
experiments are within the range /C00.25 to þ0.5 W m
/C02if the values are divided by 10
(Stuber et al., submitted for publication ). The factor of 10 is adopted since the idealized
experiments are performed with an absorption aerosol optical depth this magnitude
larger than global aerosol models predicts for current condition.Table 1Summary of radiative forcing (RF) for well-mixed and short-lived greenhouse gases,and the contribution from different aerosol effects. The uncertainty range isincluded.

Canada), Europe (including Russia and the middle East), and Asia (East, Southeast, andSouth Asia), Akimoto, 2003 .I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5169Dalsøren et al. (2009a) show that in regions where acidiﬁcation still
is of some concern (e.g., Northwest America and Scandinavia) ship
emissions contribute heavily to wet deposition of nitrate.
For road emissions Matthes et al. (2007) found maximum
surface ozone increases of 12% in northern mid-latitudes during
July. New estimates of the impact of road trafﬁc emissions on ozone,
has been calculated by Hoor et al. (2009) using an ensemble of six
global models. The result is shown in Fig. 35 along with impacts
from the other sectors. Not surprisingly, signiﬁcant enhancements
due to shipping and road trafﬁc are largely conﬁned to marine and
continental areas, respectively. However, the ship signals affect also
coastal areas, and the impact of road trafﬁc is not conﬁned to the
maximum emissions source regions in Europe and North America.
Signiﬁcant increases in ozone due to the aviation sector areconﬁned to the Northern Hemisphere, where they are zonally
mixed and, during summer, reach a maximum at high latitudes.
Scientiﬁc advances since the 1999 IPCC Special Report on Avia-
tion and the Global Atmosphere ( IPCC, 1999 ) have reduced key
uncertainties, yet the basic conclusions remain the same. The
ATTICA project has recently delivered a review of the current
impact of aviation ( Lee et al., 2009 ). Much progress has been made
in the past ten years on characterizing aviation emissions, although
major uncertainties remain, especially for particle emissions, and
the combined effect on ozone and methane through NO xemissions.
The spatial variability in the effects of the transport sectors is large,
not only because of the uneven distribution of emissions, but also
because of differences in ambient chemical and radiative regimes,
meteorological conditions, insolation, and surface properties.

The model groups involved in the QUANTIFY project have per-
formed detailed calculations of future impact from the transport
sectors. The studies focus on the time evolution between 2000 and
2050, based on the different SRES scenarios. QUANTIFY project
emission scenarios where provided for different transport sectors
(road trafﬁc, shipping and aviation) based on the IPCC SRES
scenarios A1, A2, B1, and B2 ( Nakicenovic et al., 2000 ). In addition,
a low emission scenario was provided for aviation assuming the
implementation of all available technology. The assumption is that
emissions of ozone precursors from road trafﬁc will drop to negli-
gible amounts during this century, due to emission reduction
technology. At the same time emissions from shipping and aviation
are expected to increase during coming decades, since improving
technology will not be able to compensate for the increased trafﬁc.
The climate impact from shipping is complex, since current emis-
sion trends lead to a global average negative radiative forcing
(see Section 6.2.1 ). Future climate impact will, to a large extent, be
determined by trend in emissions and on implementation of
emission regulations. It should be recognized that environmental
impact (on climate and air quality) from ships is local and regional
in nature due to contributions from short-lived compounds such as
sulfate aerosols. Dalsøren et al. (2007) have studied local effects of
ship emissions in coastal regions and in the Arctic from future
seaborne trafﬁc.
Collins et al. (2009) have calculated the impact from ship
emissions on atmospheric chemistry for the different land-based
emissions in 2000 and 2030, ACCENT PhotoComp, presented inSection 4.2.1 (Fig. 36 ). The three plots show the change in the
tropospheric ozone burden, production and methane lifetime due
to ship emission. Shipping has the largest effect when using
the 2030 MFR land-based scenario, a smaller impact when using
the 2000 or 2030 CLE and an even smaller effect when using the
high NO xSRES A2 scenario for the land-based emissions, illus-
trating the non-linearity of ozone chemistry with lower effects of
emissions when added to a higher background. The non-linearity is
stronger when looking at the change in the methane lifetime.
Collins et al. (2009) have also performed calculations showing the
effect of sulfur emissions, according to which the increase in sulfate
aerosols and sulfur deposition due to the SO 2from shipping will
offset 75% of the beneﬁts in air quality that would be expect from
land-based emission controls under the SRES A2 scenario.
6.2. Climate impact from the transport sectors
6.2.1. Impact from the different sectors
In general, emissions from the transport sectors increase ozone
and reduce methane. Ozone changes from the road sector result in
stronger forcing because of the more effective vertical mixing over
land that enhances the ozone change at higher altitudes where the
forcing efﬁciency is higher.
In a recent study Fuglestvedt et al. (2008) show, that the net RF due
to shiptrafﬁc from pre-industrialtimes to present is negative, opposite
to what is found for other sectors. Aerosols are the main reason for the
negative RF from shipping, but atmospheric reactive gases (e.g.,
methane) contribute to the negative RF. Fig. 37 depicts the combined
Fig. 34. Ozone change at the surface due to year 2000 ship emissions for January (top left), April (top right), July (bottom left), and October (bottom right) (f rom Dalsøren et al., 2007 ).I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5171RF from ozone changes and changes in methane. Ship emissions stand
out with a combined negative effect. The reason for this is that NO x
emissions from ship trafﬁc occur over pristine areas where OHenhances efﬁciently, causing a strong reduction in the CH
4lifetime and
concentration ( Dalsøren et al., 2009a; Fuglestvedt et al., 2008 ).
To investigate future impact, Fuglestvedt et al. (2008) have
integrated radiative forcing for a current emission over different
time horizons in order to compare the effect of different transport
sectors and chemical components.
Fig. 38 shows the integrated radiative forcing due to the various
components and sectors with a time horizon of 100 years, as used
in the Kyoto Protocol. According to Fuglestvedt et al. (2008) CO2is
by far the most important substance on this time scale, with the
largest contribution coming from road transport. The second
largest positive forcing comes from tropospheric ozone, again with
a dominating contribution from road transport. Changes in
methane and sulfate lead to a negative radiative forcing, with the
larges contributions coming from the shipping sector. On thechosen time scale of 100 years the contributions from the short-
lived and intermediate perturbations (ozone, aerosols, and
methane) become signiﬁcantly smaller compared with CO 2. Of the
100-year integrated net radiative forcing from total man made
emissions the net radiative forcing from transport amounts to 16%.
6.2.2. Comparison with other sectors
Recent studies have improved our understanding of the
contribution from various emission sectors and regions to RF fromozone and aerosol changes. Berntsen et al.(2006), Fuglestvedt et al.
(2008), Unger et al. (2008) estimated the contribution to ozone
radiative forcing. Unger et al. (2008) evaluated the RF due to ozone
for the year 2030 from 6 emission sectors, as indicated in Fig. 39
with the largest contribution from the transportation and biomass
burning sectors.
Koch et al. (2007) calculate the radiative forcing for the direct
aerosol from six different sectors. The impacts of present-day
aerosols emitted from particular regions and from particular

were studied. The conclusion from the work was that South-East
Asia exports over 2/3 of its emitted black carbon and sulphate
burden over the Northern Hemisphere. While Africa has the largest
biomass burning emissions, South America generates a larger
(about 20% of the global carbonaceous) aerosol burden; about 1/2
of this burden is exported and dominates the carbonaceous aerosolload in the Southern Hemisphere. The resulting calculated direct
anthropogenic radiative forcings are /C00.29, /C00.06, and 0.24 W m /C02
calculated for sulfate, organic, and black carbon, respectively. Fig. 40
shows the percentage radiative forcing from various sectors for BC,
OC, and sulfate. Two of the largest BC radiative forcings are from
residential (0.09 W m/C02) and transport (0.06 W m/C02) sectors,
making these potential targets to counter global warming suggested

power and industry sectors, and these sectors are responsible for the
large negative aerosol forcings over the central Northern Hemi-
sphere. Further studies have been performed by Shindell et al.
(2008a,b) , examining air quality (AQ) and radiative forcing due to
emissions reductions by economic sector for different regions.
6.3. The impact of large emission increases in South-East Asia
South-East Asia where emission of pollutants have increased
signiﬁcantly, particularly during the last decade, and where it is
likely that future emissions will continue to grow fast ( Isaksen
et al., 2009 ). These emissions are at such a high level that they have
the potential to markedly increase transport of ozone to the US
west coast ( Zhang et al., 2009 ), and reduce global methane levels
through enhanced OH levels ( Dalsøren et al., 2009b ). In the global
model study by Dalsøren et al. (2009b) perturbations in 2000 and
2006, and future (2020) perturbations of OH and methane lifetimesare calculated. The adopted NO
xemissions and results for the global
average changes in OH and methane lifetime are given. For details
of the adopted emissions in the model studies, see Dalsøren et al.
(2009a) . The high emission cases are based on the rapid growth in
energy use after 2000, and assumption of future signiﬁcant growth
(see also Isaksen et al., 2009 ). Note that due to the methane
response time of approximately 10 to 12 years to perturbation
changes, there will be a lag in the methane response to lifetime
changes.
In agreement with former studies it is found that global
anthropogenic emission changes have resulted in small changes in
OH and in methane lifetime from 1980 to 2000 ( Table 2 ). Asshown in Fig. 31 emission of NO x, a main OH precursor, has
decreased signiﬁcantly during this time period in Europe. The
model studies therefore indicate a signiﬁcant cancellation of the
increase in Southeast Asia from the overall global emission.
Comparison for 2000 with satellite measurements show that the
model is able to reproduce retrieved tropospheric NO 2columns
over Southeast Asia. In the high emission case the 2006 NO x
emissions were ﬁtted to the 2000–2006 increase in energyconsumption in China. This case shows better agreement with the
satellite retrieved 2000–2006 tropospheric NO
2column trend over
central and eastern China than the reference case. The satellite
comparison thereby highlights an issue noted in other studies: The
question addressed whether current emission inventories under-
estimate the recent increase in NO xemissions in Southeast Asia.
The development of global OH and methane due to emissionchanges in Southeast Asia after 2000 is also dependent on the
balance between changes in NO
xand CO emissions. From 2000 to
2006 the sign of OH and methane lifetime changes are different in
the reference case and the high NO xemission case. Though the
high NO xemission case is an upper estimate of OH changes it is
better than the reference scenario in reproducing measured NO 2
trends. From 2000 to 2020 the contributions from Southeast Asiaare moderate in the base scenario but much larger than the small
overall global emission impact from 1980 to 2000. In the 2020
high Southeast Asian NO
xemission case the impact on global OH
and methane is large. It is of comparable absolute magnitude to
the international ship trafﬁc ( Endresen et al., 2003; Dalsøren et al.,
2007; Dalsøren et al., 2009a ). The OH increase in Southeast Asia is
4.7% in the 2020 high NO xcase. Such a large change would have
a signiﬁcant effect on the oxidation of regional pollutants with
short and intermediate lifetimes.
Zhang et al. (2009) compiled a detailed anthropogenic emission
inventory for Asia for the spring 2006 period of INTEX-B but similar
toDalsøren et al. (2009b) used a higher estimate for Asian NO x
emissions by constraining them to satellite observations. Zhang
et al. (2009) found that Asian pollution enhanced surface ozone
concentrations by 5–7 ppbv over western North America in spring
2006. The 2000–2006 rise in Asian anthropogenic emissions
increased this inﬂuence by 1–2 ppbv.
6.4. Impact on the Arctic (Arctic Haze)
Human-induced climate–chemistry interactions could be of
particular importance in the Arctic. The Arctic has warmed more
rapidly during recent decades than most parts of the globe, and it is
projected to warm even more during the 21st century. During the
past 30 years, the extent of Arctic sea ice during the summer has
decreased by about 25% ( Stroeve et al., 2007 ), and the seasonal melt
area of the Greenland Ice Sheet has increased rapidly, by w7% per
decade since 1979. While much of the Arctic warming originates
from the same factors underlying global warming, studies suggest
that both tropospheric aerosols and ozone play an important role in
the Arctic.

Measurements of pollutants in the Arctic are relatively limited
compared to more populated mid-latitude regions. Long-term
(20–30 years) surface observations are available for ozone, sulfate,
BC and dust, though onlyfroma fewstations. Data fromAlert, Canada
show no appreciable trends during the 1980s, followed by decreases
in manyaerosols concentrations (sulfate, nitrate, sea-salt) during the
1990s ( Sirois and Barrie, 1999 ). Data from both Alert and Barrow,
Alaska show likewise decreasing BC during the 1990s, but suggest
that concentrations began to increase again around 2000 ( Sharma
et al., 2006 ). The trends in individual aerosol species are consistent
with observations of the overall light scattering by aerosols, which
peaks in spring as inﬂow of pollutants is large and near-surface
temperature inversions inhibit deposition, leading to the seasonal
aerosol build up known as Arctic Haze ( Iversen and Joranger, 1995 ).
Measurements of the Arctic Haze began in the late 1970s: they show
a maximum scattering during the 1980s and 1990s, followed by
decreases through around 2000 ( Quinn et al., 2007 ).
Ozone data from Barrow show a slightly increasing trend from
1975–1995, but they are not statistically signiﬁcant ( Oltmans et al.,
1998 ). In contrast, measurements of CO, the only ozone precursor
(other than methane) with long-term Arctic records, show
decreases at Northern high latitudes during the 1990s ( Novelli
et al., 1998 ). Only few long-term data on pollutants are available for
the Eastern Hemisphere side of the Arctic.
On much longer timescales, the recent analysis of black
carbon concentrations from a Greenland ice core has allowed
reconstruction of BC deposition since the late 18th century
(McConnell et al., 2007 ). These suggest that emissions in the main
source regions, North America, Europe and more recently (and to
a lesser extent) Asia, were extremely large in the early 1900s,
declined thereafter through the middle of the century, and
increased again during recent decades.
6.4.2. Climate impact of chemically and radiatively active
short-lived species in Arctic
As emissions within the Arctic are relatively small, most Arctic
pollution comes from distant sources. The relative importance of
pollutants located within the Arctic as compared with those at lower
latitudes is not clear, but remote radiative forcing appears to play
a large role ( Shindell et al., 2007 ). Direct radiative forcing due to
changes in pollutants located within the Arctic can also be
substantial, however, with seasonal values as large as 1 W m/C02
(Quinn et al., 2008 ). The contribution of various species to the total
preindustrial to present-day Arctic surface temperature trends
shows that BC, ozone and methane have together caused roughly as
much warming as CO 2, while reﬂective aerosols have caused
a cooling of comparable magnitude as seen in Fig. 41 . Shortwave
radiation is primarily perturbed via absorption by ozone and BC and
reﬂection by sulfate, OC and nitrate. Long wave ﬂuxes are affected by
ozone (and other greenhouse gases) and by aerosols. While aerosol
forcing is usually dominated by shortwave impacts, the long-wave
effects play a larger role at high latitudes during polar darkness
when observations show a distinct effect of Arctic Haze on thermal
radiation ( Ritter et al., 2005 ). Hence under Arctic conditions, aerosols
can sometimes have similar impacts as those to greenhouse gases.
Indirect effects of aerosols can also be large in the Arctic. One
prominent indirect effect is that of black carbon deposited onto
snow or ice surfaces, darkening them and reducing their albedo
(Warren and Wiscombe, 1980; Clarke and Noone, 1985; Jacobson,
2004 ). Another is the aerosol indirect effect on clouds, which can
lead to very large radiative forcings ( >3Wm/C02) by increasing cloud
cover under conditions of low insolation, which leads to a net
warming effect due to absorption of outgoing long-wave radiation
(Garrett and Zhao, 2006; Lubin and Vogelmann, 2006 ). There arelimited understanding of any of these indirect processes. For
example, aerosol indirect effects on clouds are not well character-
ized for ice phase clouds ( Quinn et al., 2008 ).
Forcing by Arctic aerosols has a strong seasonal variation for
both shortwave and long-wave components, while forcing by
ozone appears to maximize during boreal spring when Arctic ozone
abundances are comparatively large and sunlight is relatively
abundant ( Quinn et al., 2008 ).
7. Impact on tropospheric composition from climate change
and changes in stratospheric composition
Changes in climate have the potential to affect tropospheric
composition and the distribution in several ways. Changes in
circulation will alter the transport of pollutants, and in particular if
stagnant conditions during high pressure situations become more/
less frequent, conditions will be more/less favorable for the build
up of high pollutions levels (e.g., Royal Society, 2008; Matsueda
et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, higher temperatures will increase water
vapor with enhanced OH production, and lightning activities could
be enhanced in a warmer climate leading to enhanced NO x
production. Changes in surface characteristics (dryness, windspeed) will affect the exchange of components between the
biosphere and the atmosphere (see Fowler et al., 2009 ). Strato-
spheric/tropospheric exchange of, in particular, ozone is affected by
climate change, and also by changes in ozone depletion in the
stratosphere. For instance, the large stratospheric ozone depletion
in the 1980s and 1990s had an impact on stratosphere–troposphere
exchange and on ozone transport to the troposphere (e.g., van Noije
et al., 2004 ).
7.1. Impact of climate change on future tropospheric composition
7.1.1. Ozone and its precursors
Several modeling studies have investigated how future climate
change may impact tropospheric composition, ozone in particular.
An early study ( Thompson et al., 1989 ) suggested that increases in
water vapor, associated with warmer temperatures, would increase
the ﬂux through the reaction (R2: O (
1D)þH2O/2OH), enhancing
the loss of ozone and production of the hydroxyl radical. Subse-
quent work (e.g., Zeng and Pyle, 2003; Collins et al., 2003; Sudo
et al., 2003 ) additionally found that climate change led to an
increased ﬂux of ozone from the stratosphere to the troposphere.

day Arctic (60/C14to 90/C14N) surface temperature trends. Values are based on the assess-
ment of modeling and observations of Quinn et al. (2008) , and do not include aerosol
indirect effects. Reﬂective aerosols include sulfate and organic carbon.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5175More recent results from climate models, with detailed strato-
spheric dynamics have conﬁrmed that a more vigorous Brewer–
Dobson circulation (the large-scale circulation that exerts a major
control on stratosphere–troposphere exchange (STE)) is a robust
feature of models ( Butchart et al., 2006 ).Stevenson et al. (2006)
presented results from ten models that simulated the impact of
climate change between 2000 and 2030 on ozone. The main
climate feedback processes affecting ozone in these models
appeared to be the two discussed above. Some of the models were
dominated by the negative water vapor feedback, whilst the posi-
tive STE feedback was more prominent in others.
Changes in lightning (and associated NO xproduction) in
connection with climate change have been studied. Most model
studies show an increase in lightning as climate warms ( Schumann
and Huntrieser, 2007 ), with increases of up to 60% per degree K of
global mean surface warming ( Lamarque et al., 2005 ), although
other studies have shown no global trend, just a geographical shift
from tropics to mid-latitudes ( Stevenson et al., 2005 ), or decreases
(Jacobson and Streets, 2009 ). Other studies show similar discrep-
ancies, with no clear conclusions on climate change and lightning
activity. Observations show no relationship between surface
temperature and lightning in the tropics, but a strong positive
correlation over Northern Hemisphere land areas ( Reeve and
Toumi, 1999 ). Some studies suggest that increases in lightning may
be the dominant climate-related driver of future upper tropo-
spheric O 3increases ( Wu et al., 2008a ).Wild (2007) demonstrated
that changes in lightning NO xemissions had a large inﬂuence over
the tropospheric ozone burden.
Biogenic VOC emissions are a function of temperature, photo-
synthetically available radiation (PAR), leaf area index (LAI) and
plant species ( Guenther et al., 1995, 2006 ). Several global chemistry
models account for some or all of these dependencies (e.g. Hau-
glustaine et al., 2005; Stevenson et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2008a ). Most
models show an increase in tropospheric O 3as VOC emissions rise,
particularly in regions with relatively high NO xlevels; however, in
low NO xregions, O 3often decreases. VOC degradation chemistry
inﬂuences ozone’s sensitivity to VOC emissions, in particular
whether isoprene nitrate formation represents a temporary or
terminal sink for NO x(Giacopelli et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2008b ).
Horowitz et al. (2007) present observational evidence that isoprene
nitrates do permanently remove NO x, and in models that reﬂect
this ﬁnding, the surface O 3response to rising biogenic VOC emis-
sions quite rapidly saturates ( Wu et al., 2008b ), and can even result
in O 3reductions. For example, Wu et al. (2008b) ﬁnd that future
surface O 3levels in the SE US are reduced as isoprene emissions
rise. One study by Arneth et al. (2007) links biogenic VOC emissions
also to CO 2levels ( Arneth et al., 2007 ) and land-use change. The
process is not well known, and has generally not yet been consid-
ered in global models.
Changes in the biosphere associated with climate change may
have other important effects. Soil NO xemissions, produced from
bacterial activity, are likely to increase as the land warms ( Granier
et al., 2003; Hauglustaine et al., 2005; Liao et al., 2006; Wu et al.,
2008a ). Changes in the hydrological cycle, and in particular soil
moisture, may signiﬁcantly affect stomatal opening and hence dry
deposition ﬂuxes of ozone and other gases (e.g., Solberg et al.,
2008 ). Enhanced deposition will occur under wetter conditions and
visa versa. Increases in CO 2levels may reduce stomatal opening and
hence ozone deposition ( Sanderson et al., 2007 ). Furthermore,
higher temperatures will increase evaporative anthropogenic VOC
emissions (e.g., Rubin et al., 2006 ).
Trendsin cloud optical depth, aerosol loading and the solar cycle in
the tropics ( Chandra et al., 1999; Fusco and Logan, 2003 ) might
modulate troposphericozone to someextent. Climate relatedchanges
in temperature, humidity, meteorology, and land use/vegetation canalso affect ozone. Fusco and Logan (2003) estimate a 3% ozone
increase over Western Europe and 1% decline over much of North
America due to 1970–1995 temperature increase and decrease
respectively. The overall change in tropospheric ozone due to climate
change since the pre-industrial period was positive in 5 of 6 studies in
a model assessment ( Gauss et al., 2006 ). However, model studies
based on future scenarios taking into account climate changes
(Hauglustaine et al., 2005; Stevenson et al., 2006; Dentener et al.,
2005; Dentener et al., 2006c ) report a signiﬁcantly reduced global
tropospheric burden due to the effects of climate change, partly as
a result of enhanced OH formation. It should however be noted that
the signs of the changes vary in different regions of the troposphere
both for past and future changes.
More prolonged and frequent occurrence of heat waves of the
type experienced over Western Europe in August 2003 is expected
to occur in a future warmer climate. Solberg et al. (2008) applied
meteorological data in a global scale Chemical Transport Model
(the Oslo CTM2), covering the heat wave period, and showed that
under such extreme weather situations large ozone levels build up
in the planetary boundary layer with current emissions for
extended time periods (in excess of 100 ppb for several days). If the2003 heat wave is taken as a proxy for more frequent severe
weather situations during future warmer climates, the effect of
measures to control regional pollution could be strongly reduced.
7.1.2. Methane
The natural source of methane from wetlands is climate-sensi-
tive ( Gedney et al., 2004; Shindell et al., 2004 ). Changes in hydroxyl
radical (OH) concentrations directly affect the rate of methane
oxidation. Higher levels of water vapor lead to higher levels of OH
(reaction (R2)). The reaction of methane with OH is strongly
temperature dependent, and proceeds faster at higher tempera-
tures. Several model studies have noted the negative feedback of
climate on methane through these mechanisms (e.g., Johnson et al.,
2001; Stevenson et al., 2005 ). All ten of the models in Stevenson
et al. (2006) showed a reduction in the methane lifetime in
a warmer climate, with an average reduction of 4% for a global
mean surface warming of around 0.7 K.
Thawing of permafrost represents a potential signiﬁcant source
of methane to the atmosphere, and may constitute a positive
feedback mechanism in the climate–chemistry system ( Osterkamp,
2005; Lawrence and Slater, 2005; Walter et al., 2006a,b ). With
strongly enhancing temperatures in the Arctic, permafrost degra-
dation has been observed to occur rapidly ( Jorgensen et al., 2006 ),
and methane has been observed to be bubbling from melting lakes
at an increasing rate ( Walter et al., 2006a,b ). Large amounts of
organic carbon are stored in the permafrost, which partly is con-
verted to methane and emitted to the atmosphere, following the
thawing of the permafrost ( Walter et al., 2006a,b; Zimov et al.,
2006 ). There is a non-linear response in atmospheric methane
concentrations to enhanced emissions, currently giving an addi-
tional 40% increase in atmospheric concentrations (positive feed-
back) ( Prather and Ehhalt, 2001 ). The non-linear feedback is likely
to be much larger with strong enhancements in methane concen-
trations, since a larger fraction of the OH loss is through the
methane reaction. Methane emissions over periods of decades toseveral centuries in connection with permafrost thawing ( Walter
et al., 2006a,b ), combined with a methane lifetime of the order of 10
years, makes the impact of methane permafrost emissions depends
critically on the time horizon of permafrost thawing. Similar and
rapid impact on methane can occur if large amounts of methane
trapped as methane hydrates under Arctic sea ice (
Buffett and
Archer,2 0 0 4 ) are released following ocean temperature increases
and extensive sea ice melting. Although the contributions from the
described processes are uncertain, observations of emission fromI.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5176melting permafrost lakes, nevertheless show increase, although at
a small rate compared with other methane sources ( Walter et al.,
2006a,b ). Sea ice melting in the Arctic is recently found to be faster
than predicted ( Stroeve et al., 2007 ).
7.1.3. Aerosol
A few studies have considered the effects of climate change on
aerosol concentrations. Higher levels of oxidants tend to increase
secondary aerosol formation rates ( Stevenson et al., 2005; Unger
et al., 2006; Tsigaridis and Kanakidou, 2007 ). Changes in the
hydrological cycle have strong regional inﬂuences on wet removal
processes, generally increasing wet deposition ( Liao et al., 2006;
Racherla and Adams, 2006 ). The thermodynamic equilibrium of
some aerosol species may be shifted by changes in climate ( Liao
et al., 2006 ). Some sources of aerosols, such as biomass burning,
may increase as climate warms ( Jacob and Winner, 2009 ).
Following the A2 scenario, global aerosol burdens are reduced by
20% (2100–2000) in the study of Liao et al. (2006) , and by 2–18%
(2050–1990) in that of Racherla and Adams (2006) , mainly due to
enhanced deposition.
Feedback mechanisms between the physical climate state
(wind, land cover, ice cover, vegetation distribution and tempera-
ture), and natural emissions lead to changes in aerosol abundances
(dust loads, sea salt and biogenic organic aerosols) ( Mahowald and
Luo, 2003; Jones et al., 2007; Tsigaridis and Kanakidou, 2007 ). The
quantiﬁcation of such changes will require considerable research
efforts on relevant parameterizations in global models, in order to
deﬁne credible scenarios including such feedbacks.
Large uncertainties still exist in terms of natural emissions, e.g.,
DMS from the oceans and hydrocarbons from land vegetation, and
their response to climate change. There are also large uncertainties
in the contribution of biomass burning, which occurs both naturally
and due to human activity and is characterized by large inter-
annual variations, thus complicating trend analyses.
7.1.4. Effects of climate change on Arctic composition
Climate change can inﬂuence Arctic pollutants in many ways.
Changes in the transport of pollutants to the Arctic region could
occur because enhanced polar warming would reduce the gradient
between the Arctic and lower latitude pollutant source regions,
facilitating transport which is currently limited by the polar front
(constant potential temperature surfaces which intersect the
Earth’s surface and form a dome over the polar region) ( Stohl,
2006 ). Additionally, climate models generally project an enhance-
ment of the strength of Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude west-
erly winds associated with the large climate variability patterns of
the North Atlantic Oscillation and Northern Annular Mode ( Miller
et al., 2006 ), which would lead to enhanced transport of pollutants
to the Arctic ( Eckhardt et al., 2003; Duncan and Bey, 2004; Sharma
et al., 2006 ).
Emissions of ozone precursors in and near the Arctic may also
increase as boreal regions warm and forest ﬁre frequency increases.
Release of methane from enhanced boreal wetland productivity is
an additional possible consequences of Arctic warming, whose
effects would however be global given methane’s long lifetime. The
retreat of Arctic sea ice cover during springtime is also likely to alterthe ozone-depleting halogen chemistry that takes place in the
marine boundary layer ( Simpson et al., 2007 ).
The relative importance of climate-induced changes on Arctic
pollutants versus anthropogenic emission changes will clearly
depend upon future emissions. A shift of pollutant emissions from
industrialized nations to developing nations at lower latitudes is
already taking place. This may have a greater impact on pollutant
transport to the Arctic than the climate-induced changes discussed
above as pollution transport from lower latitude Asian sources issubstantially less efﬁcient per unit emission than transport from
Europe ( Stohl, 2006; Shindell et al., 2008a,b ). Furthermore,
substantial increases in local emissions are possible under
a scenario where shipping in the Arctic ocean increases substan-
tially as sea ice cover retreats ( Granier et al., 2006; Dalsøren et al.,
2007 ). Hence much work remains to better understand climate–
chemistry interactions in the Arctic and to project their role in
future Arctic climate change.
7.2. Impact of stratospheric changes on tropospheric composition
The stratosphere can affect tropospheric ozone by direct
downward transport of stratospheric high-ozone air, and by
changes in the stratospheric ozone column affecting the penetra-
tion of UV radiation, and hence tropospheric photolysis rates.
Changes in the stratosphere can also affect tropospheric circulation
patterns particularly in the polar regions such as Antarctic
circumpolar westerly winds (e.g., Perlwitz et al., 2008 ), and the
Arctic oscillation ( Hess and Lamarque, 2007 ), and hence indirectly
affect tropospheric ozone distributions.
7.2.1. Contributions of stratosphere–troposphere exchange
to the tropospheric ozone budget
Irreversible exchange of air between the stratosphere and
troposphere occurs largely in synoptic scale events. Global esti-
mates have been made using correlations between N 2O and O 3(e.g.,
Murphy and Fahey,1994 ), by 3D chemistry models (e.g., Roelofs and
Lelieveld, 1995; Jo ¨ckel et al., 2006 ), and by combining satellite
ozone observations with meteorological analyses (e.g., Olsen et al.,
2003 ). These typically give ﬂuxes in the range 450–600 Tg(O 3)y r/C01.
However there are some discrepancies in the deﬁnition of the ﬂux.
Some studies quote a ﬂux through a ﬁxed pressure level, others
through a PV surface. Many tropospheric chemistry models use the
150 ppbv ozone surface as a deﬁnition of the tropopause.
Stevenson et al. (2006) assessed the ozone budgets of 26
tropospheric chemistry models. They inferred the STE ﬂux in the
models across the 150 ppbv ozone surface by assuming a balance
between the stratospheric input, net chemical production and dry
deposition of ozone. The results gave a mean STE ozone ﬂux of
552 Tg yr/C01with a range of 151–930 Tg yr/C01. This compares to
a mean tropospheric chemical production of 5110 Tg yr/C01. Hence
STE contributes about 10% to the total tropospheric ozone budget.
This does not necessarily mean that STE contributes 10% to the
tropospheric burden since the ozone is injected into the upper
troposphere where the ozone lifetime is longer. By tagging strato-
spheric ozone in their model simulation, Sudo and Akimoto (2007)
calculated that STE contributed 23% to the tropospheric ozone
burden. Variations in STE account for 25% of the variance in the
tropospheric ozone burden between models ( Wild, 2007 ).
7.2.2. Trends in STE
The exchange of mass between the stratosphere and tropo-
sphere depends on the Brewer–Dobson circulation in the strato-
sphere (upwelling in the tropics, downwelling in the extra-tropics),which is driven by extra-tropical wave forcing. A study by Butchart
and Scaife (2001) found that the rate of global mass exchange
between the stratosphere and troposphere will increase by 3% per
decade in future. They put this down to an increased wave forcing
from more vigorous extra-tropical planetary waves in the warmer
climate. The overall trend of the Brewer–Dobson circulation is
a consistent feature of coupled chemistry climate models. Butchart
et al. (2006) estimated an average 2% per decade increase in the
tropical upwelling in 11 models over the 21st century.
The ozone concentrations in the lower stratosphere depend on
chemistry and transport, and could be strongly inﬂuenced byI.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5177climate change. Zeng and Pyle (2003) found a substantial increase
in lower stratospheric ozone, with a future climate in their model
with a top at 36 km. Another study, using a model with an 85 km
top, found that while lower temperatures increased ozone in the
upper stratosphere, this reduced the lower stratospheric ozone as
less UV could penetrate to the lower levels.
7.2.3. Trends in tropospheric ozone
Collins et al. (2003), Sudo et al. (2003) andZeng and Pyle (2003)
found that STE of ozone by 2100 would increase by 40%, 130% and
80% respectively. These models were tropospheric chemistry
models with tops between 36 and 40 km. The three studies
investigated changes in both circulation and lower stratospheric
ozone. In all these cases the change in lower stratospheric ozone
had a large effect on STE. Increased water vapor in a warmer climate
is expected to increase destruction of tropospheric ozone, but in the
above three studies increased STE partially or completely offset the
increased destruction. In the Stevenson et al. (2006) model inter-
comparison, models had varying methods of accounting for STE of
ozone. These gave STE increases with 2030s climate of 0–19%.
Recent trends in tropospheric ozone may be at least partly due
to changes in the lower stratosphere. Ordo´n˜ez et al. (2007) have
shown that a 16%/decade trend in lowermost stratospheric ozone
over Europe (1992–2004) correlates well with a 5–10%/decade
trend in lower tropospheric background ozone ( Fig. 42 ).
Stratospheric ozone depletion and its subsequent recovery will
affect lower stratospheric concentrations and hence inﬂux of ozone
into the troposphere. Ozone depletion may have offset two thirds of
the tropospheric ozone burden increase from pre-industrial times
to the present day, according to Shindell et al. (2006) . They also
suggest that of their expected 124% increase in STE in future, only
33% is due to climate change, the rest is due to ozone recovery.
7.2.4. Impact of UV changes
Since chemical processes in the troposphere are initiated by
solar UV-B penetration into the troposphere, changes in strato-
spheric ozone could affect the impact on the tropospheric oxida-
tion. Available measurements show that surface UV radiation levels
have generally increased with a geographic pattern similar to the
observed reductions in stratospheric ozone. In addition surface UV
levels will be strongly inﬂuenced by cloud cover, local ground
albedo and the atmospheric aerosol content. UV increases lead toan enhanced OH production, which reduces the lifetime of
methane and inﬂuences ozone production and loss rates. The
impact on ozone is more complex ( Isaksen et al., 2005 ). While
decreased ozone columns, enhanced surface ozone in polluted
regions, surface ozone decreased in pristine background regions
with low NO x.Collins et al. (2009) showed that during summer
with very high NO xlevels titration lowered ozone production.
Shindell et al. (2006) calculated that ozone depletion since 1979
had increased OH levels by 3.5%. This would correspond to a 5%
decrease in methane concentrations (using the factor 1.4 feedback
adjustment, from Prather and Ehhalt (2001), and assuming initial
reduction in methane lifetime is the same as the global OH
increase). Conversely ozone recovery would be expected to
increase methane and hence tropospheric ozone.
8. Cross cutting issues (policy relations, integration)
The 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) states that policies and measures to address a human-
induced climate change shall stabilize atmospheric concentrations
of greenhouse gases (GHGs) ‘‘at a level that would preventdangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system’’
(Art. 2), and that the measures should be ‘‘comprehensive’’ and
‘‘cost-effective’’ (Art. 3.3). Article 2 forms the basis for determining
the total reductions in emissions. However, due to incomplete
understanding of the climate system it is difﬁcult to determine the
appropriate level of mitigation. One major issue is the possibility
that natural ﬂuctuations such as the solar forcing have contributed
signiﬁcantly to the observed global temperature increase. One way
to assure Comprehensiveness and Cost-effectiveness as stated in
Article 3.3 is to allow ﬂexibility with respect to which species
should be mitigated. This requires an emission metric whereby the
global impact of emissions of different gases or aerosols with
different atmospheric lifetimes and different radiative properties
can be compared and weighted.
In the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the target is formulated in terms of
‘‘CO
2equivalents’’ using the Global Warming Potential (GWP)
metric concept. The principle of comprehensiveness and cost
effectiveness are made operative as the aggregate anthropogenic
carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of six speciﬁed GHGs or
groups of GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous
oxide (N 2O), hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFCs), perﬂuorocarbons (PFCs)
and sulfur hexaﬂuoride (SF 6) (Art. 3.1, Annex A). Note that apart
from being used in binding agreements emission metrics can also
be used to form a basis for common understanding of the climate
impact that can be used for example when new technology stan-
dards are developed.
While a number of interactions between atmospheric chemistry
and climate are now recognized, quantifying these interactions and
their relative importance is more difﬁcult and many uncertainties
remain. Part of the difﬁculty in fully quantifying the relative
importance of different climate–chemistry interactions is that the
composition of the atmosphere and the climate processes are
strongly coupled, thus a change in the emissions or concentration
of one gas or particle can feedback on the atmospheric composition
and climate in multiple ways. Furthermore, the large variability
both in time and space in the secondary compounds like ozone and
sulfate and organic particles make the quantiﬁcation of the
climate–chemistry interactions and adopting suitable metric for
policy measures highly complex.
8.1. Climatic response to solar forcing: overview of theories
Variations in solar activity may give rise to changes in Earth’s
atmosphere both in terms of energy as well as its composition.
Fig. 42. 12-month running means of the normalized monthly anomalies with respect
to the 1992–2004 mean annual cycle of lower free tropospheric ozone (blue) at (top)Jungfraujoch and (bottom) Zugspitze, and 150 hPa ( w13.6 km altitude) ozone averaged
for Payerne and Hohenpeissenberg (red). From Ordo´n˜ez et al., 2007 .I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5178Furthermore, some hypotheses suggest that cloud formation and
the creation of cloud condensation nuclei may be linked indirectly to
the level of solar activity through the action of galactic cosmic rays.
The notion that changes in the sun may affect weather on Earth
is old and can be traced back to early discussions in the late 17th
century ( Benestad, 2002 ). It was established in 1896 (Kristian Bir-
keland) that Aurora was connected to the solar activity, and in more
modern times an unequivocal response has been found in the
upper atmosphere ( Labitzke, 1987; Labitzke and van Loon, 1988;
Haigh, 1994, 2003; Salby and Callagan, 2000, 2004; Shindell et al.,
1999, 2001 ). But no deﬁnite and convincing evidence has yet been
found suggesting a strong link for the troposphere and Earth’s
surface climate, although changes in the temperature structure in
the stratosphere may affect the planetary wave dynamics and
hence the advection of heat.
There have been many speculations over the past centuries
about a solar connection to variations in quantities such as
temperature, precipitation, and sea level pressure, and attempts to
ﬁnd a solar link. Friis-Christensen & Lassen (1991) presented an
analysis suggesting a strong association between the warming over
the 20th century in the northern hemisphere and the solar cycle
length, but Laut (2003) andDamon & Laut (2004) reported errors in
their analysis and argued that their conclusions were invalid.
Subsequent analysis by Benestad (2005) also failed to reproduce
their results. Furthermore, it is not clear how the temperature on
Earth would be sensitive to the solar cycle length and exact which
physical processes that would be involved.
Analysis by Crook and Gray (2005a,b) andLean and Rind (2008)
found a solar cycle signature in climatic variables, although these
were weak compared to the internal variability. Furthermore,
simulations with general circulation models (GCMs) also suggest
a solar response, albeit modest ( Cubash et al., 1997; Meehl et al.,
2003 ). The level of solar activity is estimated to be high for this
millennium ( Solanki et al., 2004 ), however, direct modern instru-
ment measurements indicate that the level of solar activity has not
increased signiﬁcantly over the last 30–50 years ( Richardson et al.,
2002; Lockwood and Fro ¨lich, 2007; Benestad, 2005 ).
Traditional studies have relied on empirical evidence and
sunspot observations. More recently, additional indices as well as
more physical variables, such as the total solar irradiance (TSI) and
magnetic indices ( Lockwoo, 2002 ) have been included in similar
analyses. The level of solar output is however, still uncertain ( Lean,
2006 ), and although several reconstructions of past variations have
been published ( Lean et al., 1995; Lean, 2004; Wang et al., 2005 ),
there are still holes in our knowledge of past variations in solar
forcings. Forster et al. (2007) estimated a radiative forcing due to an
increase in TSI (1750–2005) of þ0.12 (0.06–0.18) W m/C02(90%
conﬁdence interval).
There are three main explanations for how changes in the sun
may affect Earth’s climate: (a) direct effect from TSI, (b) strato-
spheric response ( Haigh,1994, 2003 ), and (c) modiﬁcation of clouds
through shielding of galactic cosmic rays (GCR; Dickinson, 1975;
Carslaw et al., 2002; Marsh and Svensmark, 2000 ).
Climatic response involving the stratosphere is believed to
involve chemical reactions in the stratosphere (e.g. ozone), and the
fact that solar UV varies strongly over a solar cycle compared to the
total solar irradiance strongly suggests a mechanisms involving
both atmospheric chemistry and a response in the atmospheric
dynamics (e.g. wave propagation). However, the importance of this
mechanism depends on whether the variations in the stratosphere
have an inﬂuence on the lower troposphere.
While the direct TSI effect and stratospheric mechanism have
been investigated in several modeling studies, the effect of GCR has
been difﬁcult to test in the GCMs. One problem with GCR and
clouds is that the physical mechanisms are poorly known, andneither is it ﬁrmly established whether the GCR mechanism takes
place in Earth’s atmosphere. There have been several studies
questioning the hypothesis due to a lack of empirical basis ( Krist-
ja´nsson et al., 2008; Sloan and Wolfendale, 2008; Erlykin et al.,
2009 ), but also some suggesting an effect of GCRs on clouds ( Har-
rison and Stephenson, 2006; Knudsen and Riisager, 2009 ).
However, the fact that clouds may be affected by either GCR or the
atmospheric electric ﬁeld does not necessarily imply the mecha-
nism proposed by Marsh and Svensmark (2000) , where GCR is
alleged to produce higher low-cloud coverage, higher planetary
albedo, and hence lower temperatures. Pierce and Adams (2009)
attempted to model the effect of GCR on the low clouds, but found
that the changes from the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) due to
changes in the GCR were two orders of magnitude too small to
account for the observed variations in the cloud properties. For
instance, while Knudsen and Riisager (2009) reported high corre-
lation between18O records and the Earth’s magnetic dipole
moment and concluded that the tropical precipitation has been
inﬂuenced by variations in the geomagnetic ﬁeld, they also argued
that their ﬁndings gives some support to the link between GCR
particles, cloud formation, and climate. However, if GCRs result inan increase in the planetary albedo and hence a cooler climate, it is
unclear how this could lead to higher rainfall in the tropics. On the
other hand, the rainfall in the region of their study is strongly linked
to the Monsoon system, and a latitudinal shift in the position of the
system can easily translate into large increases or decreases locally.
There have also been other claims of strong solar-terrestrial links
even over the most recent decades (e.g. Scafetta and West, 2005 ),
but these are controversial and have been disputed ( Lean, 2006;
Benestad and Schmidt, 2009 ). Furthermore, a lack of trend in the
GCR since 1952 suggests that GCR is not responsible for the most
recent global warming ( Benestad, 2005 ), and recent trends in the
stratosphere further disagree with the notion of recently enhanced
levels of solar activity ( IPCC, 2007 ).
8.2. Metrics
8.2.1. Deﬁnition of a metric
In general the ‘‘CO
2equivalents’’ emissions of any component is
not linked exclusively to the GWP metric, but can be derived for any
metric M by
EmðCO2/C0eqÞ¼ Emi$Mi (1)
Where Miis the metric value for component iand Emiis the emis-
sions of component i. The metric value ( Mi) will not ensure CO 2-
equivalence in all aspects of climate change, but only with respect to
the deﬁnition of the metric ( O’Neill, 2000 ). For example the climate
impact of emissions of 1 kg of methane (with GWP 100¼25) is only
equal to that of 25 kg emission of CO 2in that the integrated radiative
forcing over 100 years after the emissions are equal. The more the
physical properties (e.g., atmospheric lifetime) of component i
deviates from that of CO 2(e.g., as for NO xand aerosols) the larger
differences can be expected for other climate impacts (e.g., on other
timescales) than the impacts that deﬁnes the metric.
The Kyoto Protocol excludes emissions of short-lived species
including all types of aerosols, or their precursors, despite the fact
that they are believed to contribute signiﬁcantly to climate change.
This could weaken efforts to mitigate climate change by weakening
the comprehensive approach embodied in the UNFCCC; indeed, the
U.S. administration has cited the absence of black carbon and
tropospheric ozone from the Protocol as one reason why they have
not become signatories. The absence could also lead to a distortion
(for example, away from economically more efﬁcient measures) of
priorities in emission reductions.I.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5179It is important to stress that the choice of a given metric do not
deﬁne the policy – they are tools that enable implementation of the
policy. However, different policy frameworks require different
metric concepts (e.g., Manne and Richels, 2001; Fuglestvedt et al.,
2003; Shine et al., 2007; IPCC, 2009 ). For example the Global
Temperature Potential (GTP, Shine et al., 2005 ) is more consistent
with a climate policy with a long-term temperature target (e.g., EU
2/C14C target) than the GWP metric used in the Kyoto Protocol.
8.2.2. Special challenges for metrics of chemically active
short-lived species
Inclusion of chemically active short-lived components like
aerosols and ozone precursors together with long-lived greenhouse
gases in a climate policy using a common metric concept gives rise
to several challenges. There are signiﬁcant uncertainties in our
quantitative understanding of the climate impacts for these species.
This includes quantitative and even qualitative understanding of
the many chemical and physical indirect effects. As an example of
indirect effects, the current deﬁnition of GWP 100for methane that is
in operational use in the Kyoto Protocol, includes indirect effects on
ozone and stratospheric water vapor ( IPCC, 2001; Forster et al.,
2007 ), but there may be further indirect effects of ozone on the
carbon-cycle as discussed in Section 5.1.3 (Sitch et al., 2007 ). In
addition, and maybe more importantly, there are also more
fundamental methodological issues caused by the very wide
range of lifetimes for the chemically active species compared to the
long-lived greenhouse gases including CO 2. An emission pulse of
a short-lived component will naturally give a climate response on
a much shorter time scale. The climate response is dominated by
the response time of the mixed layer of the ocean, i.e. 5–10 years
(e.g., Hartmann, 1996 ).
Emissions of short-lived components will not lead to globally or
hemispheric scale well mixed increases. A global metric value for
each component as indicated in equation (1)(and applied in the
form of GWPs in the Kyoto Protocol) may not be applicable to short-
lived components, and metric values that are regionally dependent
and possibly also time (e.g., seasonally) dependent should be used.
However, policy makers may decide that metric values that depend
on region and time are too difﬁcult to handle in a negotiation
process and instead accept the inaccuracies that are embedded in
a global metric value if inclusion of short-lived species is deemed to
be important.
Radiative forcing is the basis for the GWP metric based on the
assumption that other climate impacts such as global mean
temperature increase is scaling linearly with radiative forcing, i.e.
that the efﬁcacy (cf. Section 5) is equal for all forcing mechanisms.
For most of the short-lived components there are indications that
the efﬁcacy is relatively close to 1.0 ( Hansen et al., 2005 ;Forster
et al., 2007 ), there are indications that the efﬁcacy can be signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced for forcing mechanisms that is spatially correlated
with regions of strong feedbacks or if species speciﬁc processes are
involved. In particular will black carbon aerosols that are deposited
on snow trigger a strong snow-albedo feedback with efﬁcacy esti-
mates in the range from 1.8 to 3.5 ( Hansen et al., 2004; Flanner
et al., 2007 ). If indirect cloud effects of aerosols, except the cloud–
albedo effect (e.g., the cloud lifetime and semi-direct effects) arenot considered as forcing mechanisms but rather as feedbacks (as
inForster et al., 2007 ) the net effect of these emissions may have
a quite different efﬁcacy than the LLGHGs.
Chemically active components and aerosols frequently cause
negative radiative forcing and thus a cooling. For some compo-
nents like SO
2and organic carbon aerosols there will be a net
cooling, while for other like NO xthe warming (ozone) and cooling
(decreased methane through increased OH and formation of
nitrate aerosols) effects can be of similar magnitude. In the case ofNOxthe warming and cooling may cancel on a global and time-
integrated level, but since the methane perturbation is much more
long-lived, the cooling will affect both hemispheres while the
warming will mainly be conﬁned to the hemisphere where NO xis
emitted. To what extent these cooling effects should be included
in the metric values and thus in a policy aimed at reducing global
warming is basically a political questions. For instance, whether or
not to include SO 2with a negative metric value is in many ways
similar to the discussion about the use of geo-engineering to
mitigate global warming ( Crutzen, 2006; Rasch et al., 2008;
Latham et al., 2008 ).
Emissions of chemically active short-lived species often lead to
other non-climate environmental effects such as degradation of air
quality, acid deposition and eutrophication. To the extent that these
effects do not inﬂuence the climate parameter used to calculate the
metric value, these effects should not be included in the metric
value, but will, of course, in the end affect the policy development.
As discussed above there are signiﬁcant uncertainties in our
quantitative understanding of the climate impact of the chemically
active short-lived species. A metric that is to be used in binding
agreements needs to be relatively transparent and robust, robustin the sense that the scientiﬁc understanding must be sufﬁciently
mature so that the metric value is not expected to change signif-
icantly with every new study. The many indirect effects are
probably the main source of uncertainty (e.g. indirect aerosol
effects, Section 5.4).
8.2.3. Examples of published metrics
Metrics have been developed by economists based on different
kinds of optimization frameworks such as cost-beneﬁt analysis
(e.g., Kandlikar, 1995 ) and cost-effectiveness (e.g., Manne and
Richels, 2001 ). Common for these metrics is that mitigation cost
estimates and discount rates are needed and in the case of cost-
beneﬁt analysis also damage costs (could be positive or negative) of
climate change are needed. These cost estimates are highly
uncertain, and the determination of an appropriate discount rate is
highly controversial.
Purely physical metrics have also been developed, the Global
Warming Potential (GWP) being the most widely known and used
through its inclusion in the Kyoto Protocol. The AGWP(H) (Absolute
GWP) of a component iis deﬁned as the integrated radiative forcing
over a given time horizon (H) following a pulse emission of 1 kg of i.
AGWP iðHÞ¼ZH
0RFiðtÞ$dt (2)
where RF iis the radiative forcing following a pulse emission of 1 kg
ofiatt¼0. The GWP iis deﬁned as the ratio of AGWP iand the AGWP
for CO 2which is used as a reference gas.
If component iis decaying with a constant lifetime then
AGWP iðHÞ¼ aiZH
0CiðtÞdt¼aiZH
0C0$e/C0t=s$dt (3)
where aiis the radiative efﬁciency (RF per unit concentration
change) and Ci(t) is the concentration perturbation following
a pulse emission of 1 kg of i,C0is the initial concentration pertur-
bation at t¼0 and sis the lifetime of component i.
A second purely physical metric, the Global Temperature
Potential (GTP) has more recently been proposed ( Shine et al.,
2005 ). The AGTP(H) (absolute GTP) is deﬁned as the temperature
perturbation (global annual mean) at time H following a pulse
emission at time t¼0 of 1 kg of component i. As for the GWP the
GTP is deﬁned as the ratio of AGTP iand the AGTP for CO 2. To deriveI.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5180values for the GTP metric knowledge of the temporal response of
the climate system to a perturbation is needed. Several methods
have been proposed and used ( Shine et al., 2005; Shine et al., 2007;
Boucher and Reddy, 2008; Berntsen and Fuglestvedt, 2008 ), using
both simple analytical climate models and impulse response
functions ﬁtted to AOGCMs. Consensus about what is the appro-
priate method has not yet been established.
Fig. 43 shows examples of published and derived metric values
for NO xand BC particles (see Fuglestvedt et al., in press ). For NO xit
is the indirect effects through ozone formation (positive RF), and
decrease in methane lifetime (negative RF) that is included. Due to
the integrating nature of the GWP concept the strong, but short-
term, positive RF caused by ozone production have a strong impact
on the GWP even with a 100 year time horizon. For the GTP metric
even after 20 years most of the warming of the ozone has dis-
appeared and the more long-term cooling of methane reductions
dominates giving negative GTP values.
Tol et al. (2008) show that the purely physical metrics GWP and
GTP are special cases that can be derived through a number of
simpliﬁcations from a cost-beneﬁt analysis (GWP) and a cost-
effective analysis (GTP).
Although there are signiﬁcant uncertainties and it can be dis-
cussed if the GWP and GTP concepts are appropriate measures of
the climate impacts due to emissions short-lived chemically active
components, the metric values can be readily calculated based on
results from chemistry-transport models (CTM) of GCMs with
chemistry. Fuglestvedt et al. ( in press) give an overview of metric
values for both the GWP and GTP for ozone precursors, SO 2, and
carbonaceous aerosols with some information about regional
differences.
8.3. Future directions for climate–chemistry research
8.3.1. The role of model-observation and model-model comparisons
Studies of future climate–chemistry interactions rely heavily on
how models can reproduce distribution and changes in the chem-
ical active greenhouse gases. It has been demonstrated that there
are signiﬁcant uncertainties with the models, which should be
demonstrated by a couple of examples: The global tropospheric
concentration of OH, which is a key component in tropospheric
oxidation, show large spread in the comparison given in Fig. 14
(Shindell et al., 2006 ). Likewise, aerosol burdens in state of the art
models, given in Fig. 23 (the AeroCom experiment), reveal large
uncertainties in model estimates.
One of the key ﬁrst steps in quantifying climate–chemistry
interactions and perform assessments of coupled climate–chemistrymodels is to improve the modeling tools through extensive
comparisons with observations. Some past efforts have already been
made towards assessing CCMs, including Austin et al. (2003), Eyring
et al. (2005a,b, 2006) .
There are a number of ongoing activities around the world to
study various aspects of climate–chemistry interactions, in the
troposphere and stratosphere. The international Aerosol model
inter-Comparison (AeroCom), the ACCENT model inter-comparison,
the assessment of the atmospheric impact of the transport sector in
the EU funded project ATTICA and the Task Force on Hemispheric
Transport of Atmospheric Pollutants (TF HTAP) focus on climate
relevant modeling studies. Under AeroCom, global tropospheric
aerosol models were compared and tested against satellite, lidar,
and sun photometer measurements. The ACCENT-MIP effort
previously focused on coordinating and comparing IPCC scenarios
(Nakicenovic et al., 2000 ), contrasting the climate in 2030 vs. 2000
across a suite of tropospheric chemistry–climate models, with
a goal towards capturing how climate change might affect air
quality (gas species only). This effort is extended to encompass the
activities of the TF HTAP. The activities focus on understanding and
quantifying northern hemispheric transport of gaseous and
particulate air pollutants and their precursors from source to
receptor regions.
A major new international effort towards analyzing climate–
chemistry models is being coordinated, called the Atmospheric
Chemistry and Climate (AC&C) Initiative. The focus of AC&C is on
identifying science issues, providing analysis tools, coordinating
and integrating activities, and furthermore to provide input on
climate–chemistry interactions to the IPCC process.
8.3.2. Other issues in improved modeling
of chemistry–climate interactions
As noted already, advancing the quantiﬁcation of climate–
chemistry interactions will also require improvement in the
fundamental building blocks of our understanding of tropospheric
and stratospheric chemical and physical processes. These include
improvements in characterizing the rates of gas phase, heteroge-
neous, and photolytic processes; process studies in the atmosphere
to test our understanding of the chemical processes; and incorpo-

studies have been made available during the last decade, in
particular satellite observations, the actual needs for observing
the Earth’s system are expanding and require more complex
experiments covering a wide range of instruments and observed
species on a global spatial and temporal scale. The value of an
integrated global observing system is worldwide recognized as
the only way to produce systematic, coherent data, capable of
addressing climate related issues on a global scale. The different
platforms used for data collection play complementary roles in the
establishment of long-term monitoring capability of global
coverage for process and global changes studies, and remain
essential to constrain models and predict the future of our planet

9. Summary and conclusions
Potentially signiﬁcant contributions to the climate impact are
provided by compounds like CO 2,C H 4,O3, particles and cirrus
clouds. For the chemically active gases processes in the atmosphere
are important, with large spatial and temporal variations. Theclimate–chemistry interactions are therefore characterized by
signiﬁcant regional differences with regions as Southeast Asia
being a future key region due to signiﬁcant increases in energy
use, and pollution emission ( Akimoto, 2003 ;Kupiainen and Kli-
mont, 2007; Amann et al., 2008; Klimont et al., 2009; Isaksen et al.,
2009 ). Likewise, ship and air trafﬁc represent important sectors
because of signiﬁcant increases in emissions in recent years ( Eyring
et al., 2005a,b, 2007a; Dalsøren et al., 2009a; Lee et al., 2009 ). The
relative contributions to the emissions from various sectors are
expected to change signiﬁcantly over the next few decades due to
differences in mitigation options and costs.
Our ability to predict the extensive interaction between climate
and chemistry has improved signiﬁcantly over the last decade due
to an extensive increase in observational data and computer
resources, which has led to improved large-scale modeling capa-
bility for tropospheric distribution and trends. Both CTMs and
CCMs are available ( Eyring et al., 2005a,b; Bousquet et al., 2006;
Gauss et al., 2006; Stevenson et al., 2006 ) with more extensive
chemical processes included and higher resolutions, and with
observations available for model evaluation and long-term model
analysis, in particular satellite observations ( Gerasopoulos et al.,
2005; Richter et al., 2005; Laj et al., 2009 ). Extensive multi-model
comparisons and studies of emission impact have been performed
in projects like ACCENT, AEROCOM, and QUANTIFY during the last
few years. This demonstrates our ability to model man made
impact on atmospheric composition of chemically active climate
compounds ( Shindell et al., 2006; Stevenson et al., 2006; Textor
et al., 2006, Textor et al., 2007; Hoor et al., 2009 ;Fiore et al., 2009 ).
These model comparisons show, however, that there are signiﬁcant
model to model differences.
New satellite observations have provided data on the global
distribution of tropospheric column burden of ozone and methane,
as well as a number of ozone precursors (NO
2, CO, and HCHO) ( Laj
et al., 2009 ). Over the last two decades tropospheric ozone trends
from surface observations give a mixed signal depending on
regional trends in emissions of ozone precursors and possibly an
inﬂuence of a reversed trend in the inﬂux of stratospheric ozone
(Ordo´n˜ez et al., 2007 ).Shindell et al. (2006) report that a signiﬁcant
fraction of the increase in tropospheric ozone since preindustrial
time may have been reduced due to stratospheric ozone depletion.
Referring to changes since the 1970s Ordo´n˜ez et al. (2007) came to
the same conclusion. Models driven by changes in emissions are
capable of capturing some but not all of the features of the observed
trends in tropospheric ozone. A key point here is the difference inemissions from different emission sectors, and a number of studies
have focused speciﬁcally on attributing changes in atmospheric
concentrations to speciﬁc emission sectors. For instance, it is
possible that the large increase in emissions during the last decade
(Eyring et al., in preparation; Dalsøren et al., 2009a ), from ocean
going ship, may have led to increases in observed ozone at costal
stations in Europe and the western US.
OH is the key compound in the tropospheric oxidation process
(Monks et al., 2009 ). Long-term trend in global OH is signiﬁcant for
methane trend. Observations show that methane concentrations
leveled off during the last decade, although there was a signiﬁcant
increase between 2007 and 2008. It is debated if the leveling off in
methane is primarily caused by a leveling off in the emissions or if
the primary cause is an increase in global OH levels, possibly caused
by an increase in the NO/CO ratio in global emissions ( Dalsøren and
Isaksen, 2006 ). Although there is a general understanding of the OH
distribution, there are signiﬁcant uncertainties connected to OH
trends and to processes affecting distribution and trends ( Cariolle
et al., 2008 ). NO xemissions from ship trafﬁc represent a particularly
important source for atmospheric OH ( Eyring et al., in preparation ;
Hoor et al., 2009 ;Dalsøren et al., 2009a ). Surface emissions of NO x
in pristine areas from ship efﬁciently increase OH, thereby reducing
methane lifetime and atmospheric methane. It has been shown
that the efﬁcient methane reduction together with aerosol emis-
sions give a negative radiative forcing for current ship trafﬁc. Future
long-term impact will depend on mitigation measures adopted to
reduce emissions (reduction of sulfur and NO xemissions).
For aerosols a number of satellite retrievals of bulk aerosol
properties backed up by surface measurements and in-situ
campaigns have improved the understanding of the global distri-
bution of aerosols signiﬁcantly. Extensive model validation and
inter-comparisons within the AEROCOM project have revealed
signiﬁcant inter-model differences and discrepancies compared to
observations. Differences are mainly originating from differences in
model constructions ( Textor et al., 2006; Schulz et al., 2006; Textor
et al., 2007 ). Anthropogenic aerosols’ ability to alter the radiative
budget has been singled out as the most uncertain contributor to
the total anthropogenic forcing of the Earth-atmosphere system
(Forster et al., 2007 ). Several recent studies improve our under-
standing of the RF from different climate compounds. In a new
study, combining models and satellite data, Myhre (2009) esti-
mates the RF due to the direct effect of aerosols to be around
/C00.3 W m/C02, with halved uncertainty range compared to the
estimates by IPCC ( Forster et al., 2007 ).
Although the cloud albedo effect has been studied extensively for
several decades, it is still characterized by a low level of under-
standing. A number of studies on aerosol indirect effects have been
published since IPCC AR4, showing that the scientiﬁc community is
currently making an effort to increase the knowledge and reduce
uncertainties associated with aerosol indirect effects. Continued use
of satellite data combined with models, and continuous improve-
ments of cloud parameterizations, may reduce the uncertainties in
model estimates ( Anderson et al., 2003 ) of the aerosol indirect effect.
The comparison of the spread in estimates of indirect aerosol effects
inFig. 29 shows that the uncertainties have not decreased with time.
In fact, estimates span a larger range than ever, much due to the new
aerosol indirect effects recently taken into account.
A number of climate processes that inﬂuence the levels of
methane, tropospheric ozone and the oxidation capacity have been
identiﬁed through recent studies and to some extent quantiﬁed
through sensitivity experiments in models. These processes include:
Change in OH from temperature and humidity perturbations,
change in tropospheric ozone through STE exchange and changes in
stratospheric ozone; enhancements in methane emissions from
melting permafrost, changes in NO xemissions from lightning, andI.S.A. Isaksen et al. / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 5138–5192 5182change in biogenic VOC and NO xemissions from changes in surface
characteristics (humidity, temperature) ( Zeng and Pyle, 2003;
Collins et al., 2003; Isaksen et al., 2005 ;Horowitz et al., 2007 ;Sitch
et al., 2007; Walter et al., 2006a,b; Wu et al., 2008b ).
Models have been used for sensitivity studies and for studies of
changes in tropospheric and surface ozone for 2030, 2050 and 2100
due to both emission changes and climate change ( Prather et al.,
2003; Stevenson et al., 2006; Royal Society, 2008 ). Differences in
assumptions about improvements in control of precursor emissions
have signiﬁcant impacts on future tropospheric ozone concentra-
tions over the 30-year period from 2000 to 2030. An increase
between 10 and 14 ppb in annual zonal-mean ozone at 30/C14Ni s
calculated for the unregulated SRES A2 case, and a decrease of up to
6 ppb for the B2 þMFR (Maximum feasible reduction) case.
Changes in climate are found to slightly reduce the amount of
tropospheric ozone, through enhanced OH formation. Model
studies of OH concentrations in 2030 and 2050 indicate that global
OH concentrations will increase slightly due to emission changes,
but that this increase will be more than compensated by effects of
climate change. Higher temperatures give more water vapor and
enhanced OH production.
Changes in chemically active greenhouse gases and aerosols
have contributed signiﬁcantly to the overall radiative forcing since
pre-industrial times. Two considerations are important in for
estimates of future climate impact from man-made emissions: The
short chemical lifetime of most of the important chemically active
climate compounds as compared to CO 2, and the possibility for
mitigation options to reduce emissions. It is likely that in the future
the relative contribution from the chemically active climate
compounds become smaller compared to the contribution from
CO2. A consequence of the large differences in the lifetimes of the
climate compounds is that future effects are strongly dependent on
the scenarios adopted for emissions, and it is not obvious what type
of metric should be adopted ( Shine et al., 2005; Shine et al., 2007;
Berntsen and Fuglestvedt, 2008; Boucher and Reddy, 2008;
Fuglestvedt et al., in press ). Continued growth in emissions, for
instance, favors impact from the short-lived compounds.
Long-term monitoring and observation is a prerequisite to
better understand and quantify the key atmospheric processes
affecting climate–chemistry interactions. These observations are
also a key to building the scientiﬁc basis for understanding how and
why changes are occurring. Although signiﬁcant amounts of data
for large-scale model validation and process studies have been
made available during the last decade, in particular satellite
observations (see Laj et al., 2009 ), the actual needs for observing the
Earth’s system are expanding and require more complex experi-
ments covering a wide range of instruments and observed species
on a global spatial and temporal scale. A key question is the issue of
the natural variability of composition on different scales associated
with the climate variability, which indicate that longer, and
possibly ensemble simulations, may be required to extract the
signal of anthropogenic climate change on composition from that
related to natural climate variability.

Introduction 
Many studies have been carried out during the last decade to study the effect of cli­
mate change on crop yields and other key crop characteristics. In these studies, one or 
several crop models were used to simulate crop growth and development for differ­
ent climate scenarios that correspond to different projections of atmospheric C02 
concentration, temperature, and rainfall changes (Semenov et al., 1996; Tubiello 
and Ewert, 2002; White et al .• 20 11). The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and 
Improvement Project (AgMIP; Rosenzweig et al., 20 13) builds on these studies with 
the goal of using an ensemble of multiple crop models in order to assess effects of 
climate change scenarios for several crops in contrasting environments. 
These studies generate large datasets, including thousands of simulated crop 
yield data. They include series of yield values obtained by combining several crop 
models with different climate scenarios that are defined by several climatic variables 
(temperature, C02, rainfall, etc.). Such datasets potentially provide useful informa­
tion on the possible effects of different climate change scenarios on crop yields. 
However, it is sometimes difficult to analyze these datasets and to summarize them 
in a useful way due to their structural complexity; simulated yield data can differ 
among contrasting climate scenarios, sites, and crop models. Another issue is that 
it is not straightforward to extrapolate the results obtained for the scenarios to alter­
native climate change scenarios not initially included in the simulation protocols. 
Additional dynamic crop model simulations for new climate change scenarios are 
an option but this approach is costly, especially when a large number of crop models 
are used to generate the simulated data, as in AgMIP. 
Statistical models have been used to analyze responses of measured yield data 
to climate variables in past studies (Lobell et al., 2011 ), but the use of a statistical 
model to analyze yields simulated by complex process-based crop models is a rather 
new idea. We demonstrate herewith that statistical methods can play an important 
role in analyzing simulated yield data sets obtained from the ensembles of process­
based crop models. Formal statistical analysis is helpful to estimate the effects of 
different climatic variables on yield, and to describe the between-model variability 
of these effects. 
These statistical methods can also be used to develop meta-models, i.e., statistical 
models that summarize process-based crop models, enabling scientists to explore 
the effects of new climate change scenarios. This approach is illustrated with two 
simulated yield datasets obtained by AgMIP for maize and wheat that were generated 
by using ensembles of process-based crop models. The yield datasets were used 
to develop a meta-model that provides a simplified representation of the original 
ensemble of crop models. The proposed meta-model is a statistical regression with 
random coefficients that describe the variability of the simulated yield data across the 284 D. Makowski et al. 
original crop models. Once the statistical regression has been fitted to the simulated 
yield datasets, the meta-model can predict the effects of climate changes among the 
crop models and can thus be used to study alternative climate change scenarios that 
were not initially simulated. Finally, the results obtained With the meta-model were 
used to assess the risk of yield loss for maize and wheat as functions of temperature 
and C02 concentration change. 
Materials and Methods 
Simulaled yield data 
Yield data were simulated with 19 maize crop models and 26 wheat crop models in 
four contrasting sites for each species located in France (Lusignan), USA (Ames), 
Brazil (Rio Verde), and Tanzania (Morogoro) for maize, and in the Netherlands 
(Wageningen), Argentina (Balcarce), India (New Delhi), and Australia (Wongan 
Hills) for wheat. 
Several climate scenarios were considered. For both species, four temperat.ure 
changes ( +0. +3, +6, +9°C) and five atmospheric C~ concentration changes ( +0. 
+90, + 180, + 270, + 360 ppm; where the baseline C(h concentration was set at 360 
ppm) were considered over the 1980-2010 time-period. In addition, two precipita­
tion changes (0% and -30%) were considered for maize and three rates of nitrogen 
fertilization (50%, 100%, and 150% of reference rates) were considered for wheat. 
The other scenarios were defined by combining temperature, C02 concentration. 
and precipitation changes. Thirty years of yield data were generated with each crop 
model for each of the climate scenarios (Figs. 1 and 2) and the simulated yield values 
were averaged over the years. Details of the maize and wheat protocols can be found 
in Bassu et al. (2014) and Asseng et al. (20 13), respectively. 
Statistical model 
Simulated maize and wheat yield data were analyzed using two-level statistical 
random-effect models (Pinheiro and Bates, 2000). The following statistical model 
was used to analyze the maize yield data for each site separately:

Fig. 2. Wheat yields simulated by the 26 crop models in Wageningen, the Netherlands, for different 
levels of temperature change (each letter corresponds to one crop model). The reported yield data were 
obtained for a change of COz concentration equal to +180 ppm and for the baseline (1981-2010) 
level of fertilization. 
This statistical model assumes that the ensemble of P crop models is a sample 
taken within a population that includes all possible crop models for a given crop while 
flexibly allowing for the incorporation of additional crop models in the future. The 
probability distributions defined by Equation (2) describe the between-crop-model 
variability of the yield response to climate change within the whole population of 
crop models. These probability distributions cover the ranges of climate effects 
.considered in different crop models. The relationship defined by Equation (1) i8 
assumed to be valid for all crop models, but its parameters, a.ki· are assumed to vary 
among crop models. However, this statistical model only. describes 30-year mean 
yield responses and is not intended to describe the year-to-year variability of crop 
yields. Creating a statistical model that captured year-to-year variability would have 
required extra random terms and additional parameters, which would have overly 
complicated the calculated model and thus was not considered here. 
The same form of model was used for wheat as was used for maize, but replaced 
the rainfall variable, f).Rii• with a variable that describes the level of N fertilization 6 0246

in Equation (1). For the wheat pilot studies, precipitation was held constant in the 
wheat simulation protocol. 
The population parameters of the statistical model ILk, a'f, and -r2 were estimated 
by restricted maximum likelihood. The model-specific regression coefficients, aki 
(where k = 0, ... , 6 and i = 1, ... , P), were estimated by using the best linear 
unbiased predictor using the R software package ""nlme"" (Pinheiro and Bates, 2000) 
and the estimated values will be henceforth referred to as aeki. The model was fitted 
for each crop and each site separately, but was calculated for all crop models together. 
Results were analyzed site by site. 
Assessment of the statistical model 
The statistical model was compared to other statistical models, including models 
with fewer explanatory variables, models with fewer random coefficients, and a 
model that includes no random coefficients (i.e., classical linear regression). All the 
models were compared by using the Akaike information criterion (AIC; Pinheiro 
and Bates, 2000), where a lower AIC value corresponds with the better model, and 
we found that the model defined by Equations (1) and (2) led to lower AICs than 
the simpler models. The assumption that the residual errors, Eii• were independen t 
was assessed by developing another statistical model that incorporated correlated 
residual errors. The AIC value of this model was higher and the estimated cor­
relation coefficients were very low (7.6 x w-4 and -4.7 x w-3 for maize and 
wheat, respectively). The statistical model's quality of fit was also assessed by using 
graphical analysis. Evaluating the residuals did not reveal any obvious biases due 
to the assumptions made on the relationships between yields and input factors. 
Estimation of the effect of climate ·change on yield 
The statistical model described above was used to compute three different types of 
outputs: 
• The average yield loss/gain due to climate change over the ensemble of crop 
models. 
• The yield gain/loss estimated for individual crop models due to changes in climate 
variables. 
• The probability that the yield loss/gain will exceed a given threshold. 
For maize, the average yield difference obtained between a given climate change 
scenario (characterized by !J..T, !J..C, and !J..R) and the baseline scenario was 
expressed as: 
!J..Y = /1-1/J..T + 11-2!1T2 + /1-3/J..C + /L4!J..C2 + 1-£5/J..C!J..T + I-£6!1R (3) 288 D. Makowski tt al. 
The yield difference described in Equation (3) is averaged over all crop model~· • 
this difference corresponds to an average yield gain or to an average yield loss over 
the 19 submitted crop models. Equation (3) defines a meta-model that simulates the 
average output of the original ensemble of crop models. This meta-model enables 
the computation of the yield differences for any changes in temperature, C(h, and 
precipitation, !l.T, ll.C, and ll.R, at each of the four considered sites. 
For a given crop model i, the yield difference was expressed as: 
AYi = aelill.T + ae2i!:l.T2 + ae3;!l.C + ae4ill.C2 + aesi!l.Cll.T + arot!:l.R (4) 
Equation (4) defines a meta-model simulating the output of the ith crop modeL 
The yield difference ( 4) is crop model-specific. It corresponds to the climate change 
effect on yield that would have been obtained with the ith crop model if this crop 
model were run for a climate change scenario that were characterized by !l.T, !l.C, 
and !l.R. The statistical model defined by Equations (1) and (2) was also used to com­
pute the probability that the yield difference will exceed a threshold and, more 
'· specifically, the probability of yield gain or of yield loss that results from a change 
in the temperature, C(h concentration, and/or precipitation. This probability was 
computed from the following Gaussian probability distribution N(JLar; criy) as: 
2 2 ° 
/LaY= JL1!l.T + JL2ll.T + /L3!l.C + JL4ll.C + JLs!l.C!l.T + /L6!:l.R (5)

Similar relationships were derived for wheat by replacing precipitation change 
with fertilization change in Equations (3) to (6). Note that the variance defined 
by Equation (6) is not constant but varies as a function of the climate scenruio 
characteristics. Results and Discussion 
Increases in temperature 
Figure 3 shows the statistical meta-models' quality of fit calculated for maize and 
wheat (one site per crop). The distributions of the residuals for both maize and 
wheat are symmetric and do not display trends. The fitted values obtained with 
the statistical meta-models are in most cases close to the yields simulated by the 
processed-based crop models. The residual standard error of the fitted statistical 
models is equal to 0.19 and 0.22 tlha for maize and wheat, respectively, in the two 
sites considered in Fig. 3. A similar quality of fit was obtained for the other sites.

indicate the first (probability= 0.25) and third (probability= 0.75) quartiles of the 
climate change effect. 
According to Fig. 4, most of the crop models estimate that a temperature increase 
negatively impacts yield projections of both maize and wheat in all locations. But 
this effect is highly variable among crop models, with some models predicting little 
response to temperature. For maize, Fig. 4a illustrates how, on average across the 
ensemble of crop models, the statistical meta~model emulates a yield loss when tern~ 
peratures exceed+ 1.5°C with a C02 concentration increase of+ 180 ppm in Lusig~ 
nan, France. Contrastingly, the models suggest that wheat is more resilient to heat 
stress and would require a temperature threshold equal to +3.6°C before experienc~ 
ing yield losses below the baseline in Wageningen, the Netherlands (Fig. 4b ). Based 
on the emulated projections seen in Fig. 4b, the models indicate that, should climate 
change be limited to a +3oC change and include a C02 concentration increase of 
+ 180 ppm, moderate temperature increases could, in fact, lead to gains in wheat 
production in this location. 
Figure 4 also demonstrates the large variability between crop models and dis~ 
plays how this variability increases as a function of temperature. The differences 
between the first and third quartiles are much larger for higher temperature changes, 
at the given C02 concentration. This result indicates that the differences between 
crop models are much larger for high~temperature changes than for low~temperature 
changes. The level of divergence between the predictions of the crop models thus 
tends to increase with the temperature value considered in the climate change 
scenarios. 
Increases in atmospheric C02 concentratWn 
Figure 5 shows the effect of climate change at one site for both maize and wheat 
yields under increasing levels of C02 concentration, ranging from 0 to +360 ppm 
from the simulated baseline concentration (i.e., 360 to 720 ppm) at a constant temper~ 
ature increase of +2°C. Figure Sa illustrates how all crop model simulations predict 
a positive effect on maize yields in Lusignan, France when exposed to increased 
C02 concentrations, but this effect is small and varies among crop models. The 
mean curve suggests that the effect of a temperature increase of +2°C is negative 
for the range of C02 concentration increases, thus the benefit of the increased C02 
concentration does not ou~eigh the negative effect of the temperature increase. On 
average, the crop models predict a yield loss for maize, even at high C02 concen~ 
trations, due to this +2°C temperature change. 292 D. Malcowski et al.

The fitted curves obtained for C(h response of wheat in Wageningen, tl:te 
Netherlands are displayed in Figure 5b. Compared to maize, the effect of a C(h 
concentration increase is stronger for wheat. This effect is highly variable among 
crop models; some models demonstrate positive slopes over the range of C02 con­
centrations. whereas others show slopes close to zero. When averaged across all of 
the crop models. the effect of the + 2oc temperature increase is positive (yield gain) 
as soon as the C02 concentration increase reaches 100 ppm. 
Probabilistic thresholds 
An important advantage of the meta-model is that it handles the interpolation 
between temperature levels and between C(h concentration levels. Our meta-model 
can thus be used to calculate temperature and [C02] thresholds that lead to yield loss 
or yield gain. Table 1 shows the thresholds of [C~] increase required to obtain a 
probability of maize and wheat yield gain higher than 0.5 (i.e .• 50% chance of yield 
gain). These thresholds were computed for two values of temperature increase (+2 
and +4°C) and four sites per crop. It would have been very difficult to compute them 
without a meta-model. Results show that. for wheat. climate change has 50% chance 
of resulting in a yield gain if [C02] increases by at least +117 ppm (depending on It in

AgMIP pilot model intercomparison studies for maize and wheat. The results 
showed that: 
• High C02 concentrations are likely to outweigh the negative effect of increasing 
temperature, leading to yield gains for wheat with climate change, but not for 
maize. 
• Thresholds of temperature increase and C~ concentrations that lead to a spe­
cific risk level of maize and wheat yield loss can be computed by using the 
meta-model. 
• The divergence between the maize and wheat crop models and therefore the 
uncertainty in the simulated results increases as a function of temperature (the 
higher the temperature change, the higher the between-crop model variability). 
In the future, the proposed meta-model could be extended in two different ways. 
First, it could be applied to a dataset that includes simulations obtained for a higher 
number of sites. It will then be possible to include co-variables that describe site 
characteristics (e.g., soil type, agricultural practices) in the meta-model in order to 
explain the origin of the between~site variability. Second, our meta-model could be 
extended in order to describe the between-year variability of yields and to analyze the 
risk of extreme yield values for different climate scenarios. This could be achif'ved 
by including one or several additional random effects in the meta-model and by 
fitting this model to yearly yield data.

Abstract 31
The methods to quantify equilibrium climate sensitivity are still debated. We collect 32
millennial-length simulations of coupled climate models and show that the global mean equi- 33
librium warming is higher than those obtained using extrapolation methods from shorter 34
simulations. Specically, 27 simulations with 15 climate models forced with a range of CO 2 35
concentrations show a median 17% larger equilibrium warming than estimated from the rst 36
150 years of the simulations. The spatial patterns of radiative feedbacks change continu- 37
ously, in most regions reducing their tendency to stabilizing the climate. In the equatorial 38
Pacic, however, feedbacks become more stabilizing with time. The global feedback evo- 39
lution is initially dominated by the tropics, with eventual substantial contributions from 40
the mid-latitudes. Time-dependent feedbacks underscore the need of a measure of climate 41
sensitivity that accounts for the degree of equilibration, so that models, observations, and 42
paleo proxies can be adequately compared and aggregated to estimate future warming. 43
1 Estimating equilibrium climate sensitivity 44
The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is dened as the global- and time-mean, 45
surface air warming once radiative equilibrium is reached in response to doubling the atmo- 46
spheric CO 2concentration above pre-industrial levels. It is by far the most commonly and 47
continuously applied concept to assess our understanding of the climate system as simulated 48
in climate models and it is used to compare models, observations, and paleo-proxies (Knutti 49
et al., 2017; Charney et al., 1979; Houghton et al., 1990; Stocker, 2013). Due to the large 50
heat capacity of the oceans, the climate system takes millennia to equilibrate to a forcing, 51
but performing such a long simulation with a climate model is often computationally not 52
feasible. As a result, many modeling studies use extrapolation methods on short, typically 53
150-year long, simulations to project equilibrium conditions (Taylor et al., 2011; Andrews 54
et al., 2012; Collins et al., 2013; Otto et al., 2013; Lewis & Curry, 2015; Andrews et al., 55
2015; Forster, 2016; Calel & Stainforth, 2017). These so-called eective climate sensitiv- 56
ities (Murphy, 1995; Gregory et al., 2004) are often reported as ECS values (Hargreaves 57
& Annan, 2016; Tian, 2015; Brient & Schneider, 2016; Forster, 2016). Research provides 58
evidence for decadal-to-centennial changes of feedbacks (e.g., Murphy (1995); Senior and 59
Mitchell (2000); Gregory et al. (2004); Winton et al. (2010); Armour et al. (2013); Prois- 60
tosescu and Huybers (2017); Paynter et al. (2018)) but the behavior on longer timescales has 61

not been compared among models. Here, we utilize LongRunMIP, a large set of millennia- 62
long coupled general circulations models (GCMs) to estimate the true equilibrium warming, 63
study the centennial-to-millennial behavior of the climate system under elevated radiative 64
forcing, and test extrapolation methods. LongRunMIP is a model intercomparison project 65
(MIP) of opportunity in that its initial contributions were preexisting simulations, without 66
a previously agreed upon protocol. The minimum contribution is a simulation of at least 67
1000 years with a constant CO 2forcing level. The collection consists mostly of doubling or 68
quadrupling step forcing simulations (\abrupt2x"", \abrupt4x"", ...) as well as annual incre- 69
ments of 1% CO 2increases reaching and sustaining doubled or quadrupled concentrations 70
(\1pct2x"", \1pct4x""). Table 1 lists the simulations and models used here, while M. Rugen- 71
stein et al. (2019) documents the entire modeling eort and each contribution in detail. 72
The equilibration of top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiative imbalance and surface 73
temperature anomaly of the simulations are depicted in Fig. 1. Throughout the manuscript, 74
we show anomalies as the dierence to the mean of the unforced control simulation with 75
pre-industrial CO 2concentrations. Light gray dots indicate annual means of the rst 150 76
years of a step forcing simulation, requested by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 77
Phase 5 and 6 protocols (CMIP5 and CMIP6; Taylor et al. (2011); Eyring et al. (2016)) 78
and widely used to infer ECS (Andrews et al., 2012; Georoy, Saint-Martin, Olivi e, et al., 79
2013). We refer to this timescale as \decadal to centennial"". Colors indicate the \centen- 80
nial to millennial"" timescale we explore here. The diminishing distances to the reference 81
line at TOA = 0 indicate that most simulations archive near-equilibrium by the end of the 82
simulations. However, even if a simulation has an equilibrated TOA imbalance of near zero, 83
the surface temperature, surface heat uxes, or ocean temperatures can still show a trend 84
(discussed in M. Rugenstein et al. (2019)). 85
Throughout the manuscript, we use \T[specication]"" for a true or estimated equilib- 86
rium warming, for a range of forcing levels not only CO 2doubling (Table 1). We dene the 87
best estimate of equilibrium warming, T best est , as the temperature-axis intersect of the 88
regression of annual means of TOA imbalance and surface temperature anomaly over the 89
simulations' nal 15% of global mean warming (black lines in Fig. 1). The lower right panel 90
in Fig. 1 illustrates that all simulations eventually warm signicantly more (measured by 91
Tbest est ) than predicted by the most commonly used method to estimate the equilibrium 92
temperature by extrapolating a least-square regression of the rst 150 years of the same step 93
forcing simulation (Gregory et al., 2004; Flato et al., 2013), denoted here as \T est 1 150 "". 94
{4{

For simulations that have gradual forcings (e.g., 1pct2x ), we use 150 year long step forcing 95
simulations of the same model to calculate T est 1 150 . The median increase of T best est 96
over T est 1 150 is 17% for all simulations and 16% for the subset of CO 2doubling and qua- 97
drupling simulations. While T est 1 150 implies a constant feedback parameter (the slope 98
of the regression line), other extrapolation methods allow for a time-dependent feedback pa- 99
rameter, but still typically underestimate T best est : Using years 20-150 in linear regression 100
(T est 20 150 ; e.g.,Andrews et al. (2015); Armour (2017)) results ina median equilibrium 101
warming estimate which is 7% lower than T best est , both for all simulations and the subset 102
of CO 2doubling and quadrupling. The two-layer model including ocean heat uptake ecacy 103
(T EBM  ; e.g., Winton et al. (2010); Georoy, Saint-Martin, Bellon, et al. (2013)) results 104
in a multi model median equilibrium warming estimate which is 9% lower then T best est , 105
again both for all simulations and the subset of CO 2doubling and quadrupling. Both meth- 106
ods are described and illustrated in the supplemental material. 107
Tbest est of any forcing level can be scaled down to doubling CO 2levels to estimate 108
equilibrium warming for CO 2doubling. We do so by assuming that the temperature scales 109
with the forcing level, which depends logarithmically on the CO 2concentration (Myhre et 110
al., 1998), and assuming no feedback temperature dependence (e.g. Mauritsen et al. (2018) 111
and Rohrschneider et al. (2019), see discussion below). The estimate of equilibrium warm- 112
ing for CO 2doubling range from 2.42 to 5.83 K (excluding FAMOUS abrupt4x at 8.55K; 113
see Table 1 and Fig. 1). Note that the simulation abrupt4x of the model FAMOUS warms 114
anomalously strongly. As this simulation represents a physically possible result, we do not 115
exclude it from the analysis (see more details in SM Section 4). The results are qualitatively 116
the same if T best est is dened by regressing over the last 20% instead of 15% of warming 117
or instead time averaging the surface warming toward the end of every simulation without 118
taking the information of the TOA imbalance into account. SM Section 1 discusses dierent 119
options and choices to determine T best est . 120
2 Global feedback evolution 121
Current extrapolation methods underestimate the equilibrium response because climate 122
feedbacks change with the degree of equilibration (Murphy, 1995; Senior & Mitchell, 2000; 123

puted by a least square regression of all global and annual means of netTOA imbalance and 127
surface temperature anomaly within a temperature bin, which is moved in steps of 0.1 K 128
throughout the temperature space to obtain the continuous local slope of the point cloud 129
(sketched out in SM Fig. 2a). We decompose the net TOA imbalance into its clear sky and 130
cloud radiative eects (CRE; e.g., Wetherald and Manabe (1988); Soden and Held (2006); 131
Ceppi and Gregory (2017)) in the shortwave and longwave (Fig. 2a). The feedbacks change 132
continuously { not on obviously separable timescales { in some models more at the begin- 133
ning of the simulations (e.g., CESM104), in some models after 150 years (e.g., GISSE2R) or, 134
in some models, intermittently throughout the simulation (e.g., MPIESM11 or HadGEM2). 135
The shortwave CRE dominates the magnitude and the timing of the net feedback change, 136
and can be counteracted by the longwave CRE. The reduction of the shortwave clear sky 137
feedback associated with ice albedo, lapse rate, and water vapor is a function of tempera- 138
ture and occurs on centennial to millennial timescales. Longwave clear sky changes, when 139
present, contribute to the increase of the sensitivity with equilibration time and temperature. 140
The net feedback parameter can be composed of a subtle balance of dierent components at 141
any time and the forced signal is not obviously linked to the feedback arising from internal 142
variability, dened by regressing all available annual and global means of TOA imbalance 143
and surface temperature anomalies (relative to the mean) of the control simulations (circles 144
in Fig. 2a; Roe (2009); Brown et al. (2014); Zhou et al. (2015); Colman and Hanson (2017)). 145
Models which are more sensitive than other models { have feedbacks which are more 146
positive { at the beginning of the simulation are generally also more sensitive towards the 147
end. The model spread in the magnitude of feedbacks does not substantially reduce in time, 148
while the feedback parameter change varies from negligible to an order of magnitude. We 149
quantify the continuous changes across models by considering dierent time periods, namely 150
years 1-20, 21-150, and 151-1000 (Fig. 2b), in each of which we regress all points. In addition 151
to the increase of the feedback parameter between years 1-20 and 21-150, which has been 152
documented for CMIP5 models (Georoy, Saint-Martin, Bellon, et al., 2013; Andrews et 153
al., 2015; Proistosescu & Huybers, 2017; Ceppi & Gregory, 2017), there is a further increase 154
from centennial to millennial timescales. 155
Previous research has shown that the change in feedbacks over time can come about 156
through a dependence of feedback processes on the increasing temperature (Hansen et al., 157
1984; Jonko et al., 2013; Caballero & Huber, 2013; Meraner et al., 2013; Bloch-Johnson et 158
al., 2015), due to evolving surface warming patterns and feedback processes (\pattern eect""; 159

which clearly dierentiates between time/pattern and temperature/state dependence and 163
simulations with several forcing levels are needed to disentangle them. The relationship 164
between forcing and CO 2concentrations is a matter of debate (Etminan et al., 2016) and 165
further complicates the analysis, as time, temperature, and forcing level dependence might 166
compensate to some degree (Gregory et al., 2015). As not all models contributed several 167
forcing levels, we focus in the following on robust pattern changes in surface temperatures 168
and feedbacks, which occur in most or all simulations irrespective of their overall tempera- 169
ture anomaly or forcing level. 170

The evolution of surface warming patterns during the decadal, centennial, and mil- 172
lennial periods displays a fast establishment of a land-sea warming contrast, Arctic am- 173
plication, and the delayed warming over the Southern Ocean that have been studied on 174
annual to centennial timescales (Fig. 3; Senior and Mitchell (2000); Li et al. (2013); Collins 175
et al. (2013); Armour et al. (2016)). Arctic amplication does not change substantially, 176

whereas Antarctic amplication strengthens by approximately 50% on centennial to millen- 177
nial timescales (Salzmann, 2017; M. Rugenstein et al., 2019). The warming in the northern 178
North Atlantic reects the strengthening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, 179
after the initial decline (Stouer & Manabe, 2003; Li et al., 2013; M. A. A. Rugenstein, 180
Sedl a cek, & Knutti, 2016; Rind et al., 2018; Jansen et al., 2018). 181
In the Pacic, at all times, the temperatures in absolute terms are higher in the West 182
compared to the East Pacic. The eastern equatorial Pacic warms more than the warm 183
pool in most simulations, a phenomenon reminiscent of the positive phase of the El-Ni~ no- 184
Southern-Oscillation (ENSO) (\ENSO-like warming"" (Song & Zhang, 2014; Andrews et al., 185
2015; Luo et al., 2017; Tierney et al., 2019)). This tendency can last several millennia, but 186
signicantly reduces or stops in most simulations after a few hundred years. Similar to the 187
Equatorial east Pacic, the south east Pacic warms more than the warm pool (Zhou et al., 188
2016; Andrews & Webb, 2018). However, models display a large variance in the timescales 189
of warming in these two regions, i.e. the warm pool can initially warm faster or slower than 190
the south east Pacic.s Across the Pacic, the change in surface warming pattern is reminis- 191
cent of the Interdecadal Pacic Oscillation (IPO; Fig. 3d). In many models, the reduction 192
{9{

of the Walker circulation coincides with the decadal to centennial ENSO/IPO-like warming 193
pattern, but it does not obviously coincide with surface warming pattern changes on the 194
millennial timescale, indicating that subtropical ocean gyre advection and upwelling play a 195
more prominent role on longer timescales (Knutson & Manabe, 1995; Song & Zhang, 2014; 196
Fedorov et al., 2015; Andrews & Webb, 2018; Luo et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017; Kohyama 197
et al., 2017). The mechanisms and spread of model responses in the Pacic are still under 198
investigation. 199
Feedbacks dened as the local tangent in temperature-TOA space as used in Fig. 2a 200
contain a signal from both the internal variability and the forced response. In order to 201
isolate the forced response, we take the dierence of the means at the beginning and end of 202
the time periods discussed above. We call this denition of feedbacks the nite dierence 203
approach, as it represents a change across a time period (SM Fig. 2b). Fig. 4 shows the local 204
contribution to the global net TOA changes (dened as the local change in TOA imbalance 205
divided by the global temperature change.) for the same time periods and models as used in 206
Fig. 3. In the initial years, the atmosphere restores radiative balance through increased ra- 207
diation to space almost everywhere, except in the western-central Pacic (Fig. 4a), whereas 208
on decadal to centennial timescales, the structure of the feedbacks mirrors the surface tem- 209
perature evolution and develops a pattern reminiscent of ENSO/IPO (Fig. 4b). The cloud 210
response dominates the pattern change, although for CMIP5 models, changes on decadal 211
and centennial timescales have been attributed to changing lapse rate feedbacks as well (SM 212
Fig. 6-8 and Andrews et al. (2015); Andrews and Webb (2018); Ceppi and Gregory (2017)). 213
For the millennial timescales, our models show that feedbacks become less negative almost 214
everywhere, switching from slightly negative to positive in parts of the Southern Ocean and 215
North Atlantic region, and become less destabilizing in the Tropical Pacic (Fig. 4c). The 216
feedback pattern change from decadal to centennial timescales (Fig. 4d) is reversed in many 217
regions on centennial to millennial timescales (Fig. 4e), particularly in the entire Pacic 218
basin, the Atlantic, and parts of Asia and North America. This \pattern ip"" is dominated 219
by longwave CRE (SM Fig. 8) and mirrors, in the Pacic, the reduction in ENSO/IPO-like 220
surface warming patterns discussed for the surface temperature evolution. 221
Note that the local temperature is not part of the calculation of the local contribution 222
in feedback changes. Due to the far-eld eects of local feedbacks (e.g., Rose et al. (2014); 223
Kang and Xie (2014); M. A. A. Rugenstein, Caldeira, and Knutti (2016); Zhou et al. (2016, 224
2017); Ceppi and Gregory (2017); Liu et al. (2018); Dong et al. (2019)), the relation between 225
{10{
©2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.manuscript submitted to Geophysical Research Letters
the local feedback contribution (Fig. 4) and the local temperatures (Fig. 3) is not straight- 226
forward. There is strong correspondence between changes of TOA uxes and temperature 227
patterns in the Pacic on decadal to millennial timescales: Stronger (weaker) local warming 228
coincides with a more positive (negative) local feedback contribution. However, there is 229
no clear correspondence directly after the application of the forcing, or over land and the 230
Southern Ocean through time. SM Fig. 13 and 14 show overlays of Fig. 3 and 4 for a better 231
comparison. A local correspondence does not necessarily indicate a strong local feedback 232
(i.e. local TOA divided by local surface temperature change), as both the local TOA and 233
the surface in one region could be forced by another region. A closer investigation of local 234
and far-eld inuence of feedbacks is under investigation (Bloch-Johnson et al., in revision). 235
Although the spatial patterns of changing temperature and radiative feedbacks vary 236
among models, the large scale features discussed here occur robustly across most models 237
and forcing levels, and also occur in the 1pct2x and 1pct4x simulations, which are not 238
included in the gures. 239
4 Regions accounting for changing global feedbacks 240
We quantify the contribution of the tropics, extra-tropics, and polar regions to the 241
global feedback change (Fig. 4d,e) by adding up all feedback contributions of the respective 242
areas indicated by the gray triangles and expressing them as percentages of the total. We 243
note that the total is the global feedback parameter, i.e., the slope of the point clouds in 244
Fig. 1 which is indicated on the top right of each panel. These percentages reect the role 245
played by TOA uxes in each region, which is not the same as the role played by surface 246
warming in each region, as noted above. Whereas the tropics account for the bulk of the 247
change (58% on decadal to centennial and 47% on centennial to millennial timescales), the 248
mid-latitudes become more important with time (Northern and Southern Hemisphere com- 249
bined for 41% on decadal to centennial and for 66% on centennial to millennial timescales). 250
The high latitudes, dominated by the shortwave clear sky feedback (SM Fig. 12), play only 251
a minor role in inuencing the global response at all timescales. The regional accounting 252
of global feedback changes permits us to test competing explanations regarding the spatial 253
feedback pattern by placing them in a common temporal framework. Primary regions con- 254
trolling the global feedback evolution have been suggested to be the Southern Hemisphere 255
mid to high latitudes (Senior & Mitchell, 2000), the Northern Hemisphere subpolar regions 256
(Rose & Rayborn, 2016; Trossman et al., 2016), and the Tropics (Jonko et al., 2013; Mer- 257
{11{

aner et al., 2013; Block & Mauritsen, 2013; Andrews et al., 2015; Ceppi & Gregory, 2019), 258
especially in the Pacic (Andrews & Webb, 2018; Ceppi & Gregory, 2017). 259
The simulations robustly shows a delayed warming in the Southern Hemisphere relative 260
to the Northern Hemisphere throughout the millennia-long integrations, which correlates 261
with the time evolution of net TOA and shortwave CRE (not shown). This behavior lends 262
support to the hypothesis of Senior and Mitchell (2000) who propose that feedbacks change 263
through time due to the slow warming rates of the Southern Ocean relative to the upper 264
atmospheric levels. This reduced lapse rate increases atmospheric static stability (and thus, 265
the shortwave cloud response) in the transient part of the simulation, but decreasingly less 266
so towards equilibrium. 267
The extra-tropical cloud response in the model-mean is non-negligible in the Southern 268
Ocean and North Atlantic on decadal to centennial timescales, as proposed by Rose and 269
Rencurrel (2016) and Trossman et al. (2016). However, it comes to dominate the global 270
response only on centennial to millennial timescales and when both hemispheres are consid- 271
ered. 272
We nd that the longwave clear sky feedback does moderately increase in many mod- 273
els as the temperature or the forcing level increases, mainly in the tropics and Northern 274
Hemisphere mid-latitudes (Fig. 2a, SM Fig. 4, SM Fig. 5). This is in accordance with the 275
proposed argument that the tropics govern the global feedback evolution because the water 276
vapor feedback increases with warming (Jonko et al., 2013; Meraner et al., 2013; Block & 277
Mauritsen, 2013; Andrews et al., 2015), possibly following the rising tropical tropopause 278
(Meraner et al., 2013; Mauritsen et al., 2018). 279
Recent work has focused on the relative inuence of the Pacic, specically the relative 280
inuence of temperatures of the warm pool versus compared to other regions. Feedbacks in 281
regions of atmospheric deep convections have a far-eld and global eect, while feedbacks 282
in regions of atmospheric subsidence have only a local or regional inuence (Barsugli & 283
Sardeshmukh, 2002; Zhou et al., 2017; Andrews & Webb, 2018; Ceppi & Gregory, 2019; 284
Dong et al., 2019). With the available elds in the LongRunMIP archive, we cannot quan- 285
tify the relative importance of water vapor and lapse rate feedbacks. However, the short and 286
longwave cloud response (SM Fig. 6{8) in the models qualitatively agree with the proposed 287
change of tropospheric stability patterns on decadal to centennial timescales (Andrews & 288
Webb, 2018; Ceppi & Gregory, 2017), especially in the Pacic region. In contrast, on centen- 289
{12{

nial to millennial timescales, the tropical Pacic response becomes less important compared 290
to the mid-latitudes and the net tropical CRE does not change anymore (SM Fig. 6). 291
5 Implications 292
We demonstrate that the evolution of the global feedback response is dominated by the 293
mid-latitudes on centennial to millennial and the tropics on decadal to centennial timescales. 294
The global net feedback change is a result of a subtle balance of dierent regions and dierent 295
TOA components at all times; even more so in single simulations than in the model mean 296
shown here. This motivates process-based feedback studies in individual models as well 297
as multi-model ensembles to draw robust conclusions and increase physical understanding 298
of processes. To relate the timescales and model behavior to the observational record and 299
paleo proxies a better understanding of a) the atmospheric versus oceanic drivers of surface 300
temperature patters in both, the coupled climate models and the real world and b) the local 301
and far eld interactions of tropospheric stability, clouds, and surface temperatures need 302
to be achieved. Note that climate models have typical and persistent biases in regions we 303
identify as important, mainly the Equatorial Pacic, Southern Ocean and ocean upwelling 304
regions. The pattern eect of the real world might act on timescales which are dierent 305
than the ones of the climate models. 306
Our results show that radiative feedbacks, usually called \fast"", act continuously less 307
stabilizing on the climate system as the models approach equilibrium. As a result, the 308
equilibrium warming is higher than estimated with common extrapolation methods from 309
short simulations for all models and simulations in the LongRunMIP archive. ECS has 310
been historically used as a model characterization (Charney et al., 1979), but some studies 311
propose that it is not the most adequate measure for estimating changes expected over the 312
next decades and until the end of the century (e.g., Otto et al. (2013); Shiogama et al. (2016); 313
Knutti et al. (2017)). Alternative climate sensitivity measures are the eective climate 314
sensitivity computed on dierent timescales, the transient climate response to gradually 315
increasing CO 2(TCR), or the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions 316
(e.g., Allen and Frame (2007); Millar et al. (2015); Gregory et al. (2015); Grose et al. (2018)). 317
Beyond not being an accurate indicator of the equilibrium response, these alternative climate 318
sensitivity measures capture the models in dierent degrees of equilibration. We show that 319
it is an open question how dierent measures of sensitivity relate to each other. A recent 320
study shows that T est 1 150 correlates better than TCR with end-of-21st-century warming 321
{13{

across model (Grose et al. (2018), see also Gregory et al. (2015)). Thus, we underscore 322
the need of comparing models, observations, and paleo proxies on well-dened measures of 323
climate sensitivity, which ensure they are in the same state of equilibration. 324

11 Climatesensitivitydeﬁnitions: ∆Tbest est,∆Test 1−150,ECS,andother
measures
The term Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) refers to the equilibrium global and annual mean surface
temperature response to a doubling of CO 2above preindustrial levels after a step forcing, incorporating only
the “fast”, “Charney feedbacks” (Planck, surface albedo, water vapor, lapse rate, and clouds feedbacks). This
deﬁnition excludes the use of extrapolations, energy balance models, statistical models, or scaling between forcing
levels. Under this notion, ECS can not be time dependent, while other methods that approximate ECS from
shorter time scales may be. Originally, ECS was deﬁned for experiments with “slab/mixed-layer” oceans, in
which equilibration takes only about 30 years (Charney et al., 1979). For clarity, the same deﬁnition should
apply to GCM experiments, although they have to be far longer.
We deﬁne ∆Tbest estas thebest estimate of the equilibrium warming . For the equilibrated abrupt2x
simulations ∆Tbest estis ECS. The minimum requirement to contribute a simulation to LongRunMIP is that the
simulations must have at least a thousand years with a constant forcing level and an unforced control simulation.
Depending on the forcing level and model physics, 1000 years are not enough to fully equilibrate the CO 2forcing
(main text Fig.1). ∆Tbest estis determined by regressing global annual means of TOA imbalance and surface
temperature anomaly over the ﬁnal 15% of warming. We average the ﬁnal 50 years of each model integration,
determine 85% of that value, and regress all year of the model integration which follow the ﬁrst occurrence
of that value. Alternatives would be to ﬁrst smooth or ﬁt the temperature curve until is it monotonic before
determining the number of years for the regression. The number of years/points in this warming range depends
on the internal variability, forcing level, and degree of equilibration of the simulations. For simulations with a
strong curvature towards the end of the integration time (FAMOUS abrupt4x, CESM104 abrupt8x, CNRMCM61
abrupt4x, and IPSL abrupt4x ), these choices make a diﬀerence in the estimates of equilibrium warming. Our
choices result in a low estimate of ∆Tbest est, e.g., taking fewer years into account would increase ∆Tbest est.
We chose this deﬁnition of ∆Tbest estto apply the same criterium for all simulations, independent how close to
equilibrium they are. One could determine ∆Tbest estalso from the model output temperature alone (without
the use of TOA or extrapolation methods). Whether or not a simulation is equilibrated in one ﬁeld could be
deﬁned with a threshold criteria, i.e. the temperature increase or the TOA imbalance over a certain period
should be (close to) zero. Non of our results here depends qualitatively on the exact deﬁnition of ∆Tbest est.
Most other choices would increase the diﬀerence between ∆Tbest estand measures of eﬀective climate sensitivity
determined from fewer years. Rugenstein et al. (2019) discusses model biases, energy leakages, and drifts in the
LongRunMIP simulations and how to contribute to the archive.
We denote other estimates of ECS with ∆T[speciﬁcation] , wherespeciﬁcation indicates the method of estimation.
•∆Test 1−150is an estimate of equilibrium warming based on the energy balance model N = F −λT,
where N is the TOA imbalance (in Wm−2), F is the forcing (in Wm−2, intersect of the regression line
with the vertical axis at T = 0), λthe feedback parameter (in Wm−2K−1, the slope of regression line)
and T the temperature anomaly (in K). This model assumes that the global net feedback parameter is
constant, which means that for any given change in surface temperature the restoration strength of the
TOA imbalance is the same (Gregory et al., 2004; Roe, 2009; Andrews et al., 2012; Knutti and Rugenstein,
2015). To estimate ∆Test 1−150, we extrapolate the least-square linear regression of annual means of N
and T for year 1-150 to N=0, i.e. we do not use information of the forcing. Note that for doubling CO 2
concentrations ∆Test 1−150is often referred to as “eﬀective climate sensitivity” (Gregory et al., 2004).
•∆TEBM−/epsilon1, another estimate of equilibrium warming, is calculated with an energy balance model in-
cluding ocean heat uptake eﬃcacy (Winton et al., 2010; Geoﬀroy et al., 2013; Armour, 2017). This
model takes into account the eﬀect of the ocean heat uptake on the strength of the radiative feedbacks.
2The model distinguishes between the constant feedback parameter valid for the equilibrium state and a
transient feedback parameter, depending on the ocean heat uptake. The eﬃcacy factor can also be in-
terpreted as the eﬀect of changing patterns of surface heat ﬂux or surface temperature (Winton et al.,
2010; Rugenstein et al., 2016a; Rose and Rencurrel, 2016; Haugstad et al., 2017). We follow the procedure
detailed out in Geoﬀroy et al. 2013 to obtain ∆TEBM−/epsilon1, using annual means of year 1-150 for each forcing
level separately.
•∆Test 20−150is again a least-square linear regression of annual means of TOA imbalance and surface
temperature anomaly, exactly like ∆Test 1−150, but only taking into account years 20-150 (Andrews et al.,
2015;Armour,2017). Theassumptionisthatatmosphericfeedbacksonlychangeaslongastheoceanmixed
layer is out of equilibrium (10-20 years) and are constant afterwards. ∆Teﬀ 20−150might be regarded as an
approximation to the more physically motivated ∆TEBM−/epsilon1, which does not prescribe the time scale of the
mixed layer but ﬁnds it through a ﬁtting method.
SM Fig.1 relates the diﬀerent measures of climate sensitivity to ∆Teﬀ 1−150.∆TEBM−/epsilon1and∆Teﬀ 20−150raise
the climate sensitivity estimate, but less than half of the true value. There is a tendency that for lower forcing
magnitudes, the estimates are closer to the true ∆Tbest estvalue than for higher forcing magnitudes, probably
because the simulations are already more equilibrated after 150 years.

42 Feedbacks
2.1 Deﬁnitions
Aside from the kernel (Shell et al., 2008; Soden et al., 2008) and partial radiative perturbation (Wetherald and
Manabe, 1988; Meraner et al., 2013) methods, the most common way to estimate feedbacks is to linearly regress
the TOA imbalance against the surface temperature anomaly (Gregory et al., 2004; Andrews et al., 2012). To
facilitate comparison to existing literature (Andrews et al., 2015), we adopt the time periods of years 1-20
and 21-150 following a step forcing, and add a third time period, years 150-1000 years, which is covered by all
simulations in the LongRunMIPensemble. Rugenstein et al. (2019) shows some quantities for the simulations
with integration time scales above 1000 years.
Fig.2b, 3, and 4 in the main text use these time periods for the step forcing simulations only. SM Fig.5
shows all simulations, including the ramp simulations. For the ramp simulations (ECEARTH, GFDLCM3,
GFDLESM2M, MIROC32) the ﬁrst two time periods are taken from the model’s 150 year long abrupt4x simu-
lation, while the third time period starts after the end of the ramp until year 1000 (see SM Table1).

Local tangent feedback
Main text Fig.1 indicates that the feedback parameter λdoes not change on clear time scales, meaning the time
periods chosen above are ad hoc rather than representing points of inﬂection. Thus, to estimate the degree of
continuous change of the curvature in the temperature-TOA space we linearly regress global and annual means
of the net TOA imbalance for a limited temperature anomaly window (blue shading in SM Fig.2a), which is
moved in steps of 0.1K throughout the temperature space to obtain the continuous local slope of the point cloud
(Gregory et al., 2004; Knutti and Rugenstein, 2015; Rugenstein et al., 2016b). The slope is then plotted as a
function of time based on the time at which that temperature anomaly window ﬁrst occurs (main text Fig.2a
and SM Fig.4).
We adjust the width of the temperature window over which the TOA imbalance is regressed based on
the simulation (e.g., abrupt2x have smaller windows than abrupt16x ) and temperature anomaly (early in the
equilibration there are fewer points to regress, thus, the temperature window has to be wider than towards the
end of the simulation, SM Fig.2). The last regression starts at least 1K before the equilibrium temperature
is reached so that the warming signal still dominates over the internal variability. Nevertheless, the closer to
equilibration the larger the amount of internal variability regressed. We choose a conservative temperature
window width; meaning, the variability in main text Fig.2a and SM Fig.4 does not capture a large amount
of internal variability. The 2.5-97.5% uncertainty (shading) reﬂects the uncertainty of the regression of each
bin in the temperature-TOA space. A reduced temperature window width would increase the overall change
of the estimated feedback through time, especially beginning with larger magnitudes. The models’ feedbacks
arising from internal variability – obtained by regressing the annual and global means of TOA onto temperature
5anomalies in the control simulation – are indicated with circles at the right side of each panel. In the global mean,
there is no obvious connection between the feedback arising from internal variability and the forced response ( ?).
Finite diﬀerence feedback and internal variability
We are using an additional feedback deﬁnition, which represents a change acrossa certain time period:
(TOA localp2−TOA localp1)/(Tglobalp2−Tglobalp1), (1)
wherep1andp2refer to a time average at the beginning and end of a period, and TOA and T to the top of
the atmosphere and surface temperature annual anomalies. This approach is similar to the local tangent used
in main text Fig.2b and SM Fig.5, but avoids taking into account a diﬀerent number of years for the three time
periods, which implies diﬀerent degrees of internal variability can realize.
Main text Fig.4 uses Eq.1: For the ﬁrst time period, p2is the average of years 10-30, while p1is the
forcing value, obtained by extrapolating the regression of the ﬁrst 6 years to the vertical axis (Hansen et al.,
2005). Deﬁning p1as the average of the ﬁrst three, ﬁve, or ten years results in a similar pattern. For the second
time period, p2is the average of years 140-160, while p1is the average of year 10-30. For the third time period,
p2is the average of years 800-1000 (to include models which only cover 1000 years), while p1is again the average
of years 130-160. The pattern looks similar for slight changes in the averaging periods. Global numbers in main
text Fig.2b and Fig.4 do not agree due the diﬀerences in the feedback deﬁnition, the exact number of years
taken into account, the use of mean versus median, and (most importantly) the weighting of the models.
Main text Fig.3 uses, for consistency, the same time periods, but the overall pattern evolution looks similar
for other periods. The patterns show the warming distribution (unit K/K) which occurred since the last time
period. Rugenstein et al. (2019) shows the absolute anomalies (unit K) of the surface temperature evolution
(unit K).
We use the ﬁnite diﬀerence approach to ﬁlter out feedbacks associated with internal variability. In the control
simulation, the restoring feedbacks are dominated by an ENSO/IPO dominated feedback pattern, with a small
contribution of the high latitudes and the North Atlantic region (SM Fig.3). Using the local tangent approach
over a number of years in diﬀerent stages of the simulation will capture diﬀerent relative amounts of forced
response and internal variability, but only the feedbacks associated with the forced response are relevant for
estimating the ECS. Intriguingly, the spatial contribution (but not the magnitude) of the centennial time scale
feedbacks (main text Fig.4b) resembles the feedback pattern in unperturbed simulations, across the Paciﬁc and
Indian ocean basins, but not in high latitudes (SM Fig.3; Brown et al. (2014); Zhou et al. (2015); Ceppi and
Gregory (2017)).
The characteristic feedback evolution in Fig.4a-c and the “pattern ﬂip” in Fig.4d,e occursalso if we (1)
regress over the same amount of temperature anomaly (i.e. the ﬁrst, second, and third 1/3 of warming achieved
in the ﬁrst 1000 years of each simulation) or (2) use the linear regression of allyears in each period (years 1-20,
21-150, 151-1000), i.e. using the same feedback deﬁnition as used in Fig.2b, as opposed to the ﬁnite diﬀerence
approach. The “pattern ﬂip” does notoccur, when (1) comparing regressions of the same number of years, e.g.,
subsequent 200 years, as a similar amount of internal variability is regressed and dominates the overall response
or (2) when an increasing number of years are regressed, e.g., years 1-20, 1-150, 1-500, 1-1000 (as this feedback
measure does not concern a change betweentwo time periods within the simulation, but always relative to the
same control state). Thus, a remaining open question is why the forced response in the Paciﬁc on century (as
opposed to millennial) time scales is so similar to the unforced feedback pattern.

Robust behavior across models
Although the spatial patterns of changing temperature and radiative feedbacks vary a lot among models, they
are qualitatively consistent:
•in simulations with diﬀerent forcing level for the same model, e.g., MPIESM12 abrupt2x,4x,8x, and16x;
•in a sub-sample of simulations across models, e.g., in only the abrupt2x or only the abrupt4x simulations;
•in a sub-sample of models, e.g. picking randomly ten diﬀerent simulations;
•when weighting or not weighting the models according to the number of simulations they contributed;
•for diﬀerent averaging periods or time periods, e.g., if for Fig.3b and 4b p1was the average of years 30-50
andp2was the average of years 160-180.
However, regionally – on an ocean basin or continental scale or below – all these methodological choices result
in diﬀerent local feedback strengths for each model and the model average. This emphasizes the necessity of a
suite of models and a careful use and comparison of feedback deﬁnitions.

123 Simulation of FAMOUS with quadrupled CO 2concentration
The simulation abrupt4x from the model FAMOUS warms extraordinarily (Fig.1 and Table1 in the main text).
After 3000 years of simulation it does not equilibrate. However, we have not found any error in the model
integration which could have caused its behavior. The warming response is mainly due to the short wave cloud
radiative eﬀect (SM Fig.4), which is positive throughout the simulation, and the short wave clear sky feedback,
which increases more strongly than in other models within the ﬁrst 200 years. The ocean stratiﬁes strongly and
takes up heat much slower than other simulations (not shown). The simulation shows a similar change in patterns
to the other models and to the abrupt2x simulation of FAMOUS. When the ﬁelds are normalized with the global
temperature, they are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to other models, see e.g. Fig.6 in Rugenstein et al.
(2019). Thus, we conclude that the results are physically possible, of course with the caveats that apply to any of
GCMs in the LongRunMIP or CMIP5/6 archives. Even if the evolution of the climate system looks unlikely and
out of the usual range, we hope the simulation will be useful to study state dependence (Meraner et al., 2013;
Jonko et al., 2012; Caballero and Huber, 2013; Bloch-Johnson et al., 2015; Gregory et al., 2015; Rohrschneider
et al., 2019)), as opposed to the time dependence (“pattern eﬀect”) we focus on in this manuscript.

Abstract  
 
TITLE: Building Climate Resilience at NASA Ames  
AUTHORS: Laura Iraci , Chase  Mueller, Jim Podolske  
 
NASA Ames Research Center, located at the southern end of the San Francisco Bay 
(SFB) estuary has identified three primary vulnerabilities to changes in climate. The 
Ames Climate Adaptation Science Investigator (CASI) workgroup has studied each of 
these  challenges to operations and the potential exposure of infrastructure and 
employees to an increased frequency of hazards.   
Sea level rise inundation scenarios for the SFB Area generally refer to projected 
scenarios in mean sea level rather than changes in e xtreme tides that could occur 
during future storm conditions. In the Summer of 2014, high resolution  3-D 
mapping of the low lying portion of Ames was performed. Those data are integrated 
with improved sea level inundation scenarios to identify the building s, basements 
and drainage systems potentially affected. We will also identify the impacts of sea 
level and storm surge effects on transportation to and from the Center. This 
information will help Center Management develop future Master Plans.  
Climate chan ge will also lead to changes in temperature, storm frequency and 
intensity. These changes have potential impacts on localized floods and ecosystems, 
as well as on electricity and water availability. Over the coming decades, these 
changes are going to be im posed on top of ongoing land use and land cover changes, 
especially those deriving from continued urbanization and increase in impervious 
surface areas. These coupled changes have the potential to create a series of 
cascading impacts on ecosystems, includi ng changes in primary productivity and 
disturbance of hydrological properties and increased flood risk.  
The majority of the electricity used at Ames is supplied by hydroelectric dams, 
which will be influenced by reductions in precipitation or changes in th e timing or 
phase of precipitation which reduces snow pack. Coupled with increased demand 
for summertime air conditioning and other cooling needs, NASA Ames is at risk for 
electricity shortfalls. To assess the anticipated energy usage as climate changes, t he 
Ames CASI team is collecting historical energy usage data from Ames facilities, 
historical weather data, and projected future weather parameters from the CASI 
Climate subgroup.  This data will be incorporated into the RETScreen model to 
predict how ener gy usage at Ames will change over the coming century.
