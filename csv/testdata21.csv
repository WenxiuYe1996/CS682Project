Introduction

Sri Lanka hosts a population of 21 million people in a relatively small area of
65,610 km? (Fig. 1). Relatively high rainfall (1830 mm annually) and an equable
temperature regime along with fertile soils have enabled the adequate provision of
food and water to its people. Although agricultural production has increased over
the last century, the population has been rising, reaching 21 million in 2011 from
14.7 million in 1980 (Department of Census and Statistics, 2012b). While advances

Sri Lanka has achieved tremendous progress since 1950 in crop production
and food availability (Department of Agriculture, 2010; Ministry of. Agriculture
and Agrarian Services, 2008). Yields grew at an impressive rate until leveling off
in the mid-eighties (Department of Agriculture, 2009). Sri Lanka’s population is
anticipated to continue’ to grow in the coming decades (Department of Census
and Statistics, 2012a), creating an ever-greater demand for food security on the
household, sub-district, regional, and national scales (Sangakkara and Nissanka,
2008).

The agricultural sector in Sri Lanka is vulnerable to climate shocks (Yahiya
et al., 2011; Zubair, 2002), An unusual succession of droughts and floods from
2008 to 2014 has led to both ‘booms and busts in agricultural production, which
were reflected in food prices (Gadgil et al., 2011; Zubait, 2005). In both instances,
the majority of farmers and consumers were adversely affected. The cultivation of
some of the other crops (such as onions, chilies, and vegetables) has become more
economically viable especially with the constraint of water. A typical small-scale
farming system is represented schematically in Fig. 2. The household unit includes

a home garden, other field crops, and livestock.

There is a millennium-long history of adaptation (spatially and seasonally) to
climate variability across the island through choice of climatically and environmen-
tally appropriate varieties, tailoring of planting season by region, development of
appropriate irrigation infrastructure, and social and trade arrangements to suit com-
munal agricultural practices (Zubair, 2005). These adaptation methods afford some

~ potential for coping with future climate change, but they may not be capable of
! dealing with unprecedented changes. There is an ongoing program of rice varietal
# improvement at the Department of Agriculture and universities which historically
> have an excellent track record.

The AgMIP (Rosenzweig et al., 2012) regional assessment in Sri Lanka addresses
these issues by generating future climate projections and using them to drive crop
snodels that feed into integrated climate-crop-economic models that in turn quantify
climate impacts on livelihoods and poverty. We also test adaptation strategies in this
modeling framework under future representative agricultural pathways (RAPs).

Interactions with Stakeholders, Adaptation Options, and Agricultural
Pathways

Government policymakers, water-resource managers, local government officials,
and farmers have highlighted the need for reliable climate change information, the
need to orient research to address the questions they face for allocating resources,
and the need for researchers to stay engaged and to disseminate learning.

Interactions with stakeholders

Personnel from the Department of Agriculture involved with the AgMIP regional
integrated assessment have solicited advice at departmental meetings and are in a
position to contribute to departmental policy.

We have reviewed climate risk information needs with personnel of the Mahaweli
Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL), which is a large river basin management agency
that provides services for the farmers in its domain (including water distribution,
seed distribution, agricultural extension, community development, and enterprise
development). The MASL coordinates national wafer management, to which effort
the project investigators have provided a weekly climate advisory.

The University of Ruhuna researchers are engaged in a project to undertake
multi-sectoral, multi-institutional, community-based climate risk management in
the Nilwala river basin in the south (Zubair et al., 2014). The perspectives of
farmers and officials in this region regarding climate change and adaptation were

solicited.

320 E, Zubair et al.

We also interacted with bulk purchasers of rice husks for energy conversion and
tice for export as regards their needs for climate based predictions and projections
of rice harvests (Zubair et al., 2014),

Key decisions for national policymaking

Among the key decisions for rice farming systems for the decades ahead are devel-
opment of national plans for agriculture, land and water resources, food security,
environment, poverty alleviation, and guidance for long-term infrastructural invest-
ments. -

Potential adaptation strategies

Based on a review of national policy documents related to agriculture and climate
change adaptation (e.g., Ministry of Agricultural Development and Agrarian Ser-
vices, 2007; Ministry of Environment, 2010), assessments of researchers, and inter-
actions with stakeholders including farmers, the following adaptation strategies have
been proposed: (1) investment in research, innovation, and technology diffusion; (2)
promotion of better-adapted cultivation practices and adaptive management of farm-
ing systems; (3) risk management of shocks to the farm economy due to climate,
pest, diseases, and market volatility; (4) decrease in food losses from farm gate to
consumption; and (5) restructuring of policies on farming subsidies, price supports,
crop insurance, and trading policies. These policy interventions can be sharpened
and prioritized with better information on climate change and its impacts.

Farmer perceptions of climate change and potential adaption

Researchers solicited farmer perspectives in the Kurunegala (Migalewa, Kadawara-
mulla), Ampara (Mahawanawella), and Matara districts (Nilwala Basin) (Fig. 1) —
details in Zubair et al. (2014), Farmers in Migalewa perceive the following as major
climate-related problems:

» Climate: (1) Changes in total seasonal rainfall; (2) changes in starting date and
duration (number of days) of growing season; (3) increase in occurrence of
drought; (4) more frequent drought following intense rainfall.

e Crops: Increase in occurrence of crop damages and reduction in harvest due to
drought.

« Water supply: (1) drop of groundwater level; (2) decrease of water supply for
cultivation; (3) reduction in the duration of water supply for cultivation.

e Pest and diseases: (1) appearance of new diseases and pest attacks,

Climate Change Impacts on Rice Farming Systems in Northwestern Sri Lanka 321

While issues related to flooding and deforestation were not discounted, these
were not a priority for the farmers. They identified the following as practical adap-
tation options: (1) application of organic fertilizers, insecticides, and herbicides; (2)
use of drought-tolerant varieties and shorter-duration crops; (3) change of seasons for
cultivation and of planting dates; (4) crop diversification and intercropping; (5) rain-
water harvesting; and (6) diversification of livelihoods and non-agricultural income
sources. Farmers did not think it was practical either to undertake drip irrigation or
energy-intensive cultivation.

Constructing Representative Agricultural Pathways

Representative agricultural pathways (RAPs) ensemble an overall narrative descrip-
tion of a plausible future development pathway and key variables with qualitative
storylines and quantitative trends — consistent with higher level pathways such
as SSPs and RAPs developed by the AgMIP global modeling group (Rosenzweig,
et al., 2013a ) described further in Part 1, Chapter 5 in this volume.

RAPs were constructed in consultation with researchers and officials, officers
of the Department of Agriculture, and the other departments based on literature
from several government agencies, consultation meetings, and iterative review. The
salient projected changes that are most likely in the coming decades are:

» The current trend of economic growth is projected to continue.

e Population growth rate remains low and urban population increases while rural
household size decreases, and farm size declines.

e Rice productivity shall be adversely affected due to deterioration of soil fertility,
extreme weather events, climate change, and phasing out of fertilizer subsidies
(without adaptation). ;

+ Transportation infrastructure improves and trade policy encourages exports an
imposes high taxes on imports of food that can be grown locally.

e Technology developments in the rice sector with high-yielding, drought--and
flood-tolerant cultivars, and improved crop management practices shall improve
rice productivity.

Summary Narrative of the Adopted RAP

Best practices are implemented in a context of economic growth, low population
growth, urbanization, and increasing productivity in the rice sector in a business-
as-usual scenario. The government invests more in agriculture to improve food
security through self-sufficiency in rice within a framework that promotes the ability
of the rice sector to cope with impacts of a variable climate. This is done in a

magnitude of change and the confidence of all the variables were assessed with the
involvement of experts.

Inrelation to the biophysical parameters, temperature changes and land degrada-
tion were identified as important, while there was low confidence on the precipitation
increases that have been projected in the past. Among the socio-economic parame-
ters, the current and likely future dearth of agricultural labor and outward migration
for employment were identified as important parameters. Among the institutional
and policy changes, a reduction in fertilizer subsidies is anticipated, even while
investment in the agriculture sector could increase and the coordination among dif-
ferent agencies dealing with agriculture could improve. In the technological realm, it
is anticipated with high confidence that farmers will have improved access to infor-
mation on markets, weather, and climate in the future and that improved varieties
of rice will become available.

Data

Sri Lanka has rich archives of agronomic data (Pain, 1986; Wickremasinghe, 2006),
which have led to (1) long-term studies on crops, including detailed field trials and
coordinated rice trials; (2) long-term climate data at fine resolution (e.g., Zubair,
2004); (3) household-level survey data and aggregated data for economic analysis
and (4) data from rice research stations and university research programs.

Climate data

Station data.

Meteorological data for Batalagoda (7.51° N, 80°43’ E), Maha Iluppallama (8°10
N, 80°45’ E), and Maho (7°82’ N, 80°27’ E) of precipitation, maximum temperature,
and minimum temperature were obtained for the period of 1 980-2012. Daily rainfail,
minimum and maximum temperature, atmospheric pressure, and sunshine hours are
recorded at these stations (Zubair et al., 2014).

Reanalyses data

The AgMERRA data produced by the AgMIP Climate Team (Ruane et al., 2014)
from the MERRA data (Rienecker et al., 2011) were used for gap-filling and for
variables that were not available, after applying necessary bias-corrections.

Climate change model simulations and scenarios

The data from the 20 GCMs in the CMIPS5 archive (Taylor et al., 2012) were
used for projecting future climate. Analysis was restricted to five GCMs (CCSM4,

324 L, Zubair et al.

GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, MIROCS, and MPI-ESM-MR) that were identi
fied by AgMIP as relatively skillful in reproducing the climate over South Asia by
AgMIP. oe

Crop Data

Aggregate historical data on area of cultivation, production, and yield are estimated -
collectively by several government agencies.

Rice experimental trials

Experimental data for rice trials are available from thte Department of Agriculture
(Batalagoda, Maha IIlupallama, and other field stations). Calibrations were carried
out on the following varieties of data in wide spread use in the region — Bg300
(three months duration), At308 (three months), Bg357 (three-and-a-half months),
Bg358 (three-and-a-half months), and Bg379-2 (four to four-and-a-half months). 2
Forther details are available in the chapters on calibration in Zubair er al. (2014)
including for other varieties (Bg250, Bg304, Bg307, Bg94-1).

Data from (1) detailed field trails and (2) Coordinated Rice Variety Trials
(CRVTs), were used for calibration and evaluation of models. These detailed exper-
iments, conducted at the Rice Research and Development Institute (RRDI) of Sri
Lanka at Bathalagoda, from 2001-2010 in the major (Maha) and minor (Yala)
growing seasons with two nitrogen fertilizer levels. CRVTs were conducted at two
different agroecological regions of RRDI and FCRDI (Field Crop Research and
Development Institute (FCRDI) at Maha Iluppallama), during the two growing
seasons from 2000 to 2008.

The size of the experimental plot was.18 m? (6m x 3 m). Recommended standard
procedures by the Department of Agriculture (DOA) were adapted for rice crop
management. Irrigation was provided, then the land was ploughed, crop residues of
the previous season were incorporated three weeks before planting, and the soil was
puddled continuously with subsequent ploughing/harrowing actions undertaken at
least twice to make the fields weed-free and level before planting.

The crop was established by broadcasting pre-germinated seeds (direct seeding
at a rate of around 350 plants/m?). Irrigation water was provided as required and
maintained at a standing water level of about 25 mm starting from one week after
emergence until grain-filling was completed.

Fertilizer application was carried out asrecommended by the DOA. Split applica-
tion was practiced as at planting, first top dressing (two weeks after planting), second
top dressing (five weeks after planting), third top dressing (seven weeks after plant-
ing) for three-month varieties, and additional application of N at booting stage for

the DOA recommended fertilizer levels. Continuous monitoring of pest and disease
outbreaks was undertaken and appropriate control measures were applied whenever
necessary.

For the detailed experiments, growth and development parameters (plant height,
leaf area, and tiller count) were recorded at regular intervals, along with time taken
to panicle initiation, anthesis and maturity stages. Yield and yield components were
measured at maturity. For CRVT experiments, time taken to heading and harvesting
stages; and yield measurements were recorded.

Data for Integrated Assessment

Researcher-conducted surveys of farming systems are available for a cross-section
of farmers in selected locales in the Kurunegala district (Fig. 1). These locales are
referred to as Set 1 (Nikaweratiya, Rajangane, and Batalagoda) and Set 2 (Kadawara-
mulla, Migalewa) and details are provided in Zubair et al, (2014). All of the locations
except Kadawaramulla practice cultivation in the minor Yala season, In Kadawara-
mulla there is a system of irrigation in alternate years for Yala for each bank of the
feeder irrigation canal. Including Kadawaramulla ensures that we capture practices
that are representative of the entire district. Although we have conducted surveys
for two successive Yala seasons for Kadawaramulla, the year it received irrigation
coincided with a drought that devastated the tice crop during the Yala season. So for
Set 2, to be able to represent both seasons, we report here on the results for Migalewa
while detailed results for Kadawaramulla are not shown here, but are included in
Zubair et al. (2014) and in Herath et al. (2013).

Soil and climate files were developed for the respective sites based on the
recorded information (Mapa et al., 2005). Additional soil testing was undertaken for
Kadawaramulla and Migalewa (Zubair et al.,2014). Crop management practices for
farmer fields were estimated based on the farmer-survey information and standard

practices.

Methods of Study

Climate

The work followed methods outlined in the AgMIP Handbook (Rosenzweig et al.,
2013a) and described further in Part 1, Chapter 3 in this volume.

Quality control

Inconsistent data entries were identified and removed. Neighboring station data were

compared in cases of unusual observations. The solar radiation data were taken from

326 L, Zubair et al.

stations for validation in the case of temperature. Other gaps of data (more than two .
days) were filled by using the AgMERRA dataset prepared by the AgMIP climate #~
team with bias-correction. cs
In instances where the farm locations were not close to the meteorological sta ""4 ,
tions, a method of extrapolation developed by the AgMIP Climate Team based on the =
high-resolution monthly Spatial climatologies developed by WorldClim was used,

Mid-20th century projections

The work reported here focused on GCM-based estimates for the mid-20th century
(2040-2070) under a high-emission-concentration pathway (RCP8.5) (Moss et a/ :
2010; Taylor et al., 2012). The results from the following five GCMs were used for
some of the more detailed analysis as they represent the South Asian region better:
CCSM4, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, MIROCS, and MPI-ESM-MR (labeled
as E, I, K, O, and R Tespectively). The methodology for downscaling the climate
projections to each station was based on the “delta method” (Wilby et al., 2004), The
implementation is described in detail in Part 1, Chapter 3 in this volume. Time series
at individual stations were created by modifying the meteorological station data with
mean monthly spatial differences provided by the WorldClim dataset (Hijmans etal.,
2005).

The significance of future change in this average temperature precipitation and
of all 20 GCMs were tested based on whether there was a change of two standard
deviations of yearly variation (see Part 1, Chapter 3 in this volume).

Crop Model Calibration and Simulations

Calibration

Calibration of DSSAT-CERES-Rice version 4.5 (Jones et al. 2003), and APSIM-
ORYZA version 7.5 (Keating et al., 2003) crop models was undertaken for the
commonly used varieties of rice in Sri Lanka for which experimental data were
available (Bg 250, Bg 300, Bg 357, Bg 358, Bg 379-2, At 307, and At 308). These
data are based at Batalagoda and Maha Tupallama, along with the data from the

DSSAT CERES-Rice calibration

Detailed experiments and CRVT from two experimental sites at Batalagoda and
Mahailluppallama were used. for gencralized likelihood uncertainty estimation
(GLUE) runs, initially only for phenology. Then GLUE-estimated phenology was
fixed for the estimation of growth parameters (G1, G2, G3, G4) by using measured
growth variables in detailed experiments. The grain size (G2) was calculated for
selected varieties based on historical data and fixed for the variety. Therefore, only
G1, G3, and G4 were estimated from GLUE runs of detailed experiments. The crop
model simulations were evaluated by using model efficiency criteria for leaf-area
index (LAD, tops weight, tiller number, and yield predictions for detailed experi-
ments, and yield only for CRVTs. The genetic coefficients obtained are provided in
Table 2.

APSIM calibration

The same dataset used for DSSAT calibration was used for APSIM calibration. The
APSIM-ORYZA model parameters of rice according to different growing stages
were considered for the calibration of the respective varieties; these include two
photoperiod-sensitive stages and two growth parameters. Developmental stages of
the crop model are: :

The fixed values of DVS at important growth stages in APSIM are 0 (at sowing),
0.65 (at panicle initiation), 1 (at flowering), and 2 (at maturity).

Developmental rate parameters (DVS) were calculated by using growing degree
days (GDD). GDD were calculated by using Tmax, Tmin, and base temperature (Tp).

DSSAT-CERES and APSIM-ORYZA crop model simulations

DSSAT-CERES and APSIM-ORYZA simulations were undertaken based on the
farmer surveys identified as Set 1 and Set 2. These simulations were undertaken with
Consistent genetic coefficients, consistent choices for management but differentiated ro
by the details of the farm surveys and the soil and weather for Set 1 and Set 2.

The “TT tools” developed by AgMIP were used to undertake the large number of
simulations required in a batch mode. The weather, soil, fertilizer, water, and crop
management data were incorporated into the input files (Le., field overlay file, survey
data file, and seasonal strategy file) that were prepared for the QUADUI AgMIPIT

tool (Rosenzweig et al., 2013a). This enabled the generation of DOME and ACMO Bes.
files for input into the crop simulations and integrated assessments. L:

Farm-survey data were used in order to match crop management (Hoogenboom —
etal., 2010), ic., planting, harvesting, application of inorganic fertilizer, irrigation, |
and applications of crop residues and organic manure. oi

Yields for the “current year” (2012/2013 for Set 1), were simulated for individual a
farm fields. For Set 2, the current year was September 2011 to August 2012 for
Kadawaramulla and September 2012 to August 2013 for Migalewa. “

Using these simulated results for the “matched data case” (Rosenzweig et al.. F
2013a) were obtained where the models use weather, soil, and management foreach
field to simulate production matched with observed yields for each field. Yields for
the future periods (2040-2069) were obtained by using the corresponding climate
change scenarios derived from global climate models and observed weather data
(Rosenzweig et al., 2013a, 2013b). a.

In simulating the future period, automatic planting was set within an interval
of time with conditions for soil water content (i.e., target rainfall accumulation)
specified at 20 mm. The harvesting option was set as “when the crop is mature”.

Integrated Assessment

We used the Tradeoff Analysis Model for Multi-dimensional Impact Assessment
(TOA-MD) economic model, which is a multi-dimensional impact assessment pro-
gram that utilizes statistics of farm characteristics (means, standard deviations, coef-
ficients of variation) to simulate the impacts of environmental changes on economic
conditions (Antle, 2011; Antle and Valdivia, 2006). In this study we use it to assess
climate change impacts on socio-economic aspects of farming systems with the
intent of providing support for informed policymaking. The model could be used in
the future for prospective evaluation of technology adoption and technology impact
assessment, payments for ecosystem services and environmental change impact and
adaptation.

The TOA-MD analysis was undertaken for a population of heterogenous farms
under one stratum with one production activity of growing rice. These methods were
followed to answer the following three “core climate impact questions” as posed by
AgMIP (Rosenzweig et al., 2013a).

1. What is the sensitivity of current agricultural production systems to climate
change?
This seeks to address the impact of climate change on the current production.

2. What is the impact of climate change on future agricultural production systems?
This seeks to address the impact of climate change on the future production
system. Technological and other developments in the agricultural sector may
alter the current production system in the future. Hence vulnerability to climate
change may be dissimilar to the case of the current production system, which is
described in the Question 1 simulations.

. What are the benefits of climate change adaptations?

This line of inquiry seeks to assess the advantages of adaptation strategies in
abating deleterious climate change impacts on the future rice-production system.
While we have undertaken work on adaptation, it shall be reported in the future.

w

While TOA-MD analysis was initiated for all of the farming systems, in this
chapter results are presented only for Migalewa.

In setting up the TOA-MD model there was one key assumption. The farmer
surveys in Migalewa were undertaken separately for each of the two seasons in
the same small region. The populations of farmers for each season have similar
household economics and use similar crop management practices. In fact, nine

Maha season, there is an increase in temperature ranging from 1.1 to 2.4°C. The
monthly climatology of rainfall in the future period shows a significant increase
from September to November for all GCM scenarios and less change in other

months.

A significance test was undertaken with a
yearly variation for either parameter taken as significant for the mean alone, and
both mean- and variability-based scenarios (see Part 1, Chapter 3 in this volume).
The results show that the temperature rise is significant in both scenarios for all
GCM outputs for both Yala and Maha.

For Maha, there is an increase in average rainfall of up to 9.5 mm/day in the future
period (with one GCM showing a drop of 0.1 mm/day) from a current average of 6

For the Yala season, there is an increase in rainfall of up to 2 mm/day for 10 of
the GCMs and a decrease in rainfall for the rest of up to 1 mm/day from an average
of 3.5 mm/day. However, only 10% of the GCMs showed a significant anomaly (a
rise in this instance), and none of the five selected GCMs had a significant change
in rainfall.

Crop modeling results
DSSAT-CERES calibration results

Simulated results with DSSAT-CERES for time taken to‘panicle initiation, anthesis,
and maturity from emergence compared well with observed values for detailed and
CRVTs experiments. RMSE (root mean square error) was around four to five days
for all varieties (see Fig. 4 for calibration results of anthesis and yield for the Bg 300
cultivar). RMSE for yield was lower for the Bg 357 cultivar (425 kg/ha), compared
to the other two varieties Bg 300 and Bg 358, which ranged from 1800 to 2000
kg/ha. All varieties had a similar RMSE of ~1400 for grain yield. Deviations for
top weights and grain yields for these varieties compared to those observed were
mainly due to biotic stress. For example, CRVTs of Bg 358 recorded lower observed
yields due to a pest attack at grain-filling, which could not be controlled in time.

APSIM-ORYZA calibration results

The APSIM-ORYZA model calibration results (Fig. 4) showed a good fit, indicating
RMSE for time taken to panicle initiation, anthesis, and maturity, were in the range
of three to six days. RMSE for grain yield was around 1000 kg for Bg 300 and Bg
357, while it was higher (1200 kg) for Bg 358. Deviation of simulation for grain
yields for these varieties compared to the observed was mainly associated with the
biotic stress. For example, CRVTs of Bg 358 recorded lower observed yields due to
a pest attack at grain-filling, which could not be controlled in time.

Crop simulation results for farm survey yields and climate scenario effects

Parallel studies were undertaken for two sets of locales chosen from the Kurunegala
district as described in the methodology. Set 1 included farm survey data from Bata-
lagoda, Nikaweratiya, and Rajanganaya and Set 2 included Migalewa and Kadawara-
roulla.

Crop simulations were generated using DSSAT and APSIM crop models. The
same genetic coefficients as described above were used. Simulations for the base

from DSSAT in the top panel for the major (AJ) and minor (B1) seasons. The results from APSIM-
ORYZA simulations are shown in the bottom panel for the major (A2) and minor (B2) seasons.

However, APSIM simulated higher yields during the major season (RMSE of
1700 kg/ha) compared to the minor season (Fig. 5). Multi-model comparison of the
probability of exceedance of simulated vs. observed yield revealed a more-or-less
similar relationship between the two crop models for the minor season compared to
the major season (Fig. 5).

Our simulations are undertaken with the assumption that the crop is not water-
stressed. Water limitation for the rice crop is relatively lower in the major season
than in the minor season. Sensitivity of these crop models to water status may have
contributed to these differences. Farmer survey revealed that some farmers were

unable to get the required fertilizer at the correct time, and the application was Zi
delayed particularly in the minor season. Few farmers, especially in the Batalagoda
region, also reported that their fields were infested with weeds that they were unable
to control. These reasons may have also contributed to lower observed yield for
some farmers, though the amount of fertilizer applied remained the same, resulting ~
in higher simulated yields, RMSE, and poorer yield distribution fit for probability
of exceedance in both crop models (Fig. 6).

Yield prediction with DSSAT with GCM scenarios

reductions for the five GCMs CCSM4, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, MIROCS,
and MPI-ESM-MR (labelled E, I, K, O, and R) were 13, 12, 19, 15, and 16%, while
percent reduction for the minor season was 27, 28, 41, 33, and 36%. The highest
reduction was observed for the HadGEM2-ES (K) GCM for the minor season being
the warmest of selected five GCMs. Since the Yala is the warmer season, it is likely
that if temperature rises excessively, then the rice crop which is usually at its higher
range of temperature tolerance (Weerakoon ef al., 2005) shall be adversely affected.

Yield prediction with APSIM with GCM scenarios

Different responses were observed for the climate change yield simulations with
APSIM. Though a slight yield reduction was observed for all five GCMs in the
major season, higher yields were simulated for four GCMs (except for the Had-
GEM GCM) in the minor season. Percentage yield reductions observed for the
Maha season compared to the base period for the five GCMs (CCSM4, GFDL-
ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, MIROCS, and MPI-ESM-MR) were 5, 5, 8, 5, and 6%
respectively while only 2% reduction was observed for the HadGEM2-ES GCM for

the Yala season, The other GCMs €, I, O, and R) simulated 8%, 9%, 9%, and 3% *
greater yields respectively for the minor season, compared to the baseline period, '
In both seasons the highest yield reduction was observed for the HadGEM GCM.

SET 2: Kadawaramulla and Migalewa

Farmer-specific rice yields were simulated for Set 2 for the historical period and E
the projections of the five GCMs of mid-century (2050s) for the major and minor
seasons using DSSAT and APSIM.

Results of the DSSAT simulations for the historical period of the major and
minor seasons for the Migalewa location of Set 2 (Figs. 8 and 9) are qualitatively
similar to that presented for Set 1. The RMSE of simulated yields is mostly the
same (Fig. 8). The yield distribution as probability of exceedance matches well to
the observed farm yield distribution (Fig. 9).

The yields simulated with DSSAT are reduced for all five GCMs for both major
and minor seasons (Fig. 10). For Migalewa, the percentage yield losses in the
major season compared to baseline for the five GCMs (CCSM4, GFDL-ESM2M,
HadGEM2-ES, MIROCS, and MPI-ESM-MR) were 6.8, 6.1, 14.5, 7.5, and 7.9%
respectively. Similarly for the minor season, the yield reduction was 24.8, 26.7, 36.8,
24.6, and 30.6% respectively. For Kadawaramulla yield reductions in the major

Climate Change Impacts on Rice Farming Systems in Northwestern Sri Lanka 343

Climate change has a net negative economic impact on 76-88% of farmers with

a a
the future agricultural production system. The gains in the future under different
GCMs range between 9.5 and 10% of mean farm returns (bottom left Fig. 11);
aay losses range from 19 to 29% of mean farm returns). The losses under HADGCM-
ES2 (GCM: K) are the highest. Net impact due to climate change would be negative
for all GCM and losses shall range from $-19% of net farm returns).
a ogoe Poverty rate in the future production system without climate change is 27.8%.
“ However poverty rates would increase with climate change by 12-26%. Poverty
rates and per capita incomes under Question 2 have decreased in comparison to
maw Question 1 (without climate change). The increase in off-farm income by 30% as
x oN anticipated under the RAPs has caused this decrease. The decrease in household
sizes (by 16%) has also contributed to bringing down poverty rates.
& 8 4 Sensitivity analysis
To address the sensitivity of the TOA-MD results to the choice of future trends
em @ in the RAPs, we have redone the analysis with a different set of growth factors
obtained mostly from the global IMPACT economic model (Group 2 in Table 5).
Between Group 1 and 2, the trends for global prices, household size, farm area,
co om om and non-agricultural income were identical. There were significant differences in
ee the trends for yield, local prices, and cost of production with the values in Group 2
being approximately about 15-20% greater. The results are shown in Table 7 and

Conclusions and Discussion

A sustained program of research under AgMIP has led to the implementation of
climate, crop, and economic models of rice agricultural systems in Sri Lanka. ‘

Conclusions

Climate

The climate projections show a clear increase in temperature in the mid-20th century
for a high greenhouse gas concentration pathway (RCP8.5); these models show a
tendency towards a wetter future but there is scatter in these results, The results wete
largely consistent across five locations in Sri Lanka and the details are provided for
data from the northwestern Province. The changes in the model output are described
in terms of the Maha and Yala seasons next, The increase in average temperature for
2040-2070 from that of 1980-2010 ranged from 1.1-2.4°C for Maha and 1.5-2.8°C ;
for Yala seasons. The rainfall shows a Slight increase for a preponderance of the 20 '
GCMs in the CMIPS archive, with the highest increase for October-November. :
During Maha, the average rainfall rises from a present average of 6 mm/day up toa
future 9.5 mm/day for 19 of the models while it drops by 0.1 mm/day for one model
The magnitude of the rise was statistically significant for 16 of these models. During :
the Yala season, half of the models showed a decline in average rainfall of up to 1
mm/day from the normal of 2 mumn/day, including four of five selected GCM outputs *
} and 10 of the other models showed an increase — this increase was statistically |
Hil significant for these ten models,

Climate Change Impacts on Rice Farming Systems in Northwestern Sri Lanka 345

Simulations were undertaken for farmer fields with Set 1 and Set 2 of data with
DSSAT and APSIM rice models and the DSSAT results are presented for both sets.
These simulations showed an adequate match of the probability of exceedance in the
case of DSSAT for both sets while the estimates from the APSIM models were lower.

Under the projected climate change, the simulations using DSSAT with climate
change scenarios projected relative yields that were lower for the Maha season (by
6-19% for Set 1 and 6-15% for Set 2) and for the Yala season (24—41% for Set 1
and 25-37% for Set 2).

Crop simulations from DSSAT and APSIM with Set 1 showed contrasting results.
The comparison of simulated and observed yields for the farmer fields in Set.1
showed a lower RMSE with DSSAT than APSIM for Maha but not for Yala. Simu-
lated yields showed yield drops for the future- 12-19% for Maha and 27-41% for
Yala.

The adverse effects were more pronounced for the Yala season. The GCM with
the highest temperature increase — HadGEM2-ES — showed the highest yield
drop — 41% for Yala.

Integrated assessment

The TOA-MD economic model was used to assess the socio-economic impacts on
paddy farmers due to climate change. The projected climate change brings losses for
most farmers (ranging from 75-85% losers depending on the GCMs) for Migalewa.
TOA-MD results for the GCM with the highest temperature increase (HadGEM2-
ES) showed the lowest yields and highest economic impacts with 85% losers.

The impact of climate change on the future production system was assessed
(Question 2) assuming that future production system will differ from current
production system due to continuation of current development trends in the agricul-
ture sector, Considering such trends along with climate change leads to a simulated
77-88% losers in Migalewa.

The results were sensitive to the choices in parameter trends obtained from the
RAPs and the ones obtained from IMPACT. This has important implications for
the design and implementation of policies and, adaptation strategies based on the
analysis of possible future impacts of climate change. More work is needed to
understand better the effects of technology and price trends as a result of global
economic models or other projections.

Discussion

Climate

The future projections for temperature reported here are consistent with past IPCC
projections for South Asia (IPCC, 2007). The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)

""We have assessed the sensitivity of rice yield with temperature; CO», and rainfall by

346 L, Zubair et al.

anticipates an increase in temperature of 2.4 to 2.6°C in the global average for“. -
RCP2.6 for 2046-2065 and an increase in annual rainfall of up to 10% for 208]
2100 (IPCC, 2013).

There has been a multiplicity of downscaled climate projections for Sri Lanka “
based on assessments prior to ARS which was reviewed by Eriyagama and Smakthin,
(2010). These projections agree reasonably among themselves on projections for
temperature and disagree widely among themselves for projections of precipitation, !
The contribution of this work is to undertake assessments with the entire ensemble of iS °
CMIPS models and present the ensemble of results, which also includes uncertainty
among model implementations.

While this work provides for uncertainty among the climate models, we doneed *"" :
to address the larger issue of how well the models perform in this tegion, the smal] “::
spatial scales that we consider, and the robustness of the models as they take on |
different regimes in the climate system. The climate models as implemented also do 7
not provide a basis for future changes in extreme events. These are issues that could
be better answered in the future and should be considered in the interpretation of
implications for policymaking.

In the recent decades, there has been a tendency towards drying conditions in
the study region and in Sri Lanka generally. Such a trend has not been captured
by models in the past. This phenomenon of near-term climate change needs to
be addressed in the future. Thus the paradox of the recent drying trend alongside

projections of wettening needs to be addressed.

Crop

varying each of these parameters individually in the anticipated range of changes
with a DSSAT crop model implementation with Set 1 (Zubair et al., 2014), The
model shows very little sensitivity to changes in rainfall by, and modest sensitivity
to CO:, but high sensitivity to changes in temperature. These results are consistent 7
with past work that shows that rice yields are expected to increase with elevated CO-

levels and decline with increases in temperature (Wassmann and Dobermann, 2007)

but provide specific quantitative details for our model implementation in Zubair :
et al. (2014),

The effects of pests and diseases on paddy production can override some of the
Projections and thus need to be taken account of in the future. The role of rising
salinity will have to be considered in the coastal areas that are vulnerable to salt
water intrusion into groundwater associated with sea level rise.

There is a need to implement modules and test their implementation to take better
account of water stress in the rice crop models as we use these models for relatively :

Climate Change Impacts on Rice Farming Systems in Northwestern Sri Lanka 347

There is a range of climates even within the rice-growing areas of Sri Lanka,
which includes warmer, colder, drier, and wetter climates, and other soil types and
associated agricultural practices for which the crop models should be further tested.
One could also take advantage of practices in locations that may have a present
climate similar to a projected future climate elsewhere.

Integrated assessment

In the RAPs that we used, the future agricultural practices help improve rice produc-
tivity trends and help mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on agricultural
systems, Any RAP is only representative and other choices should be considered.
The results from the TOA-MD model are highly dependent on the crop model sim-
ulations and on model implementation.

Any biases in the crop simulations would affect the TOA-MD results signif-
icantly. The samples used to parameterize the model are fairly small under this
study. In the future, the crop and economic models shall be implemented for other
sites where we already have survey results.

Our analysis points to the likelihood of inadequate income stability of farming
and this can cause farmers to look for other employment options. Increase in off-
farm employment under the RAP could have been one of the factors leading to this
outcome. However this could pose a serious threat to rice production and will need
to be addressed.

An aggregate study (Seo et al., 2005) to assess climate change impacts on agri-
culture in Sri Lanka show that impacts due to climate change could vary from —11
billion rupees to +39 billion rupees nationally depending on the climate scenario
(Seo et al., 2005). This work has provided for economic impacts on a much finer
scale, taking better account of local conditions. Although one may say that there is
general agreement with our work, the state of such studies are preliminary and highly
dependent on future projections, methodology, and future agricultural pathways.

Adaptation measures

The adaptation strategies that were described in the first section of this chapter are
aimed to deal with three important issues. Coping with extreme risks for farmers,
varietal improvement, and coping with water scarcity. An extension to the current
analysis will be to assess the impacts of those adaptation strategies on the agricultural
production system of Migalawa.

Farmer risk reduction and risk transfer

Both our surveys of farmers and work with the economic analysis highlighted
the need for better management of risks that farmers face. Better weather- and

be prioritized if there is a policy priority for sustaining the number of rice farmers -
in Sri Lanka. F

Changes in varietal use and varietal improvement

There is significant variation of climate in Sri Lanka and agricultural practices. Thus.

as climate changes it may still be possible that varieties adapted to other regions
become better suited for a given region. Such an analysis of climate shall pomt

to some options for varietal adoption. Further analysis of data from varietal trials a
may help. In addition, there is an ongoing program of varietal improvement in Sri“:.
Lanka which may be critical as climate changes. The adoption of varieties that Sd
have enhanced flood, drought, salinity, and disease tolerance as the climate and soil ?”
conditions change may be critical to tolerant rice varieties,

Water management

Our work here has been with assumptions of perfect irrigation, However as seen
in Kadawaramulla, drought and irrigation failures are critical. Moreover, there is -
increasing likelihood of diversion of water for urban use and other purposes (Zubair 2.

etal., 2014). Thus greater attention shall have to be paid to assessing the risk of wate:
scarcity in the future in agricultural areas, the risks in ensuring adequate irrigation
and the use of water conservation techniques.
