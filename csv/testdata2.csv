average climate conditions really produce the highest 
yields with reductions in the most extreme years (as 
determined by ranking the 1980 -2009 seasons 
according to rainfall and temperature ).
Rainfed Maize Response to Extremes (Fig. 6a)
•Maize models simulate lower yields for hotter and 
wetter conditions, but cool and wet extremes are the 
best years.  This may come from maize generally being 
grown in areas where frost during the growing season 
does not occur, or from shortcomings in model 
simulation of frost and water logging damages.
Rainfed Rice Response to Extremes (Fig. 6c)
•Most C3MP rice results use paddy management, so 
higher rainfall can be problematic due to leaching of 
nitrogen.  Dry extremes do not seem damaging.  Cool 
conditions are not much different than average, but 
warm extremes can have a large impact.
Rainfed Peanut Response to Extremes 
(Fig. 6d)
•Peanut models show a strong response to 
precipitation, with dry and warm conditions leading to 
the lowest yields.  Extremely wet seasons are 
favorable despite known problems from pod rot when 
soil is saturated.
•Emulators derived from C3MP sensitivity tests offer a mechanism to quickly 
assess any new climate scenario, providing a number of climate impact 
metrics.  Figure 3 presents projected changes in growing season temperature 
and precipitation in Ames, Iowa, USA, from the corresponding grid -box in 29 
CMIP5 GCMs.  CO2 concentrations for future periods are determined by the 
time period and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP; Moss et al., 2010) 
as listed in Table 1.  These CTW changes provide the inputs for emulators such 
as Eqn. 1.
•While the sign of precipitation change is unclear in Ames, the overall warming 
trend is clear.  Projections show a general pattern where warmer models tend 
to also be drier, while relatively cooler models are wetter.  
•As some AgMIP activities are limited by computational power and resources 
to analyze the huge number of possible models and scenarios that are possible 
(across climate/crop/economic/emissions/adaptation options), the cool/wet, 
cool/dry, hot/wet, hot/dry, and middle regions of projected change provide a 
strong basis for sub -setting the larger CMIP5 GCM ensemble.  The number of 
GCMs in each region also can serve as a relative weight in understanding the 
probability of each GCM in the subset.
•Similar projections can also be made from regional climate models, statistical 
projections, and future iterations of CMIP.C3MP sensitivity tests are used to fit emulators capturing the core crop model 
response to a range of temperature changes (T= -1 to +8˚C), precipitation 
changes (P = -50 to +50%), and CO2concentrations ([CO2] = 330 to 900 ppm).  
•These emulators take the form:
Q(T,P,[CO2])= a + bT + cT2+ dP + eP2+ f [CO2] + g [CO2]2 
+ h [T*P] + i [T*CO2] + j [P*CO2] + k [T*P*CO2] (Eqn. 1 ),
and are similar to those used by Crimp et al. (2008), for example, but add cross 
terms that allow for climate factor interactions (Ruane et al., 2014) .  These 
emulators have demonstrated strong fidelity to the raw crop model sensitivity 
test simulations, as evidenced by correlations and RMSE ( McDermid et al., 2015).
•Crop model emulators may be visualized through impact response surfaces 
showing mean yield response as well as uncertainty across analyzed simulation 
sets (Figure 2).  Across 126 rainfed maize sites there is a clear detrimental 
response to warmer and drier conditions, with a minor benefit from elevated 
[CO2] (maize=C4).  This quantifies the straight -forward mean yield response to 
mean climate change that has been the focus of most impacts assessments.
•Uncertainties remain large, particularly in response to temperature increases 
(right side of Figure 2).  Uncertainty across sites can come from many sources, 
including: soils, cultivars, management, crop models, baseline climate 
conditions, and fertilizer.  These results underscore that crop response to 
climate is not universal (Bishop et al., 2015).The Coordinated Climate -Crop Modeling Project (C3MP; Ruane et al., 
2014) was developed as an initiative of the Agricultural Model 
Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP; Rosenzweig et al., 
2013) to mobilize the worldwide network of crop modeling experts for 
a distributed climate impact study.  Participants document their crop 
modeling sites and then run a set of 99 sensitivity tests using climate 
data from the 1980 -2010 period provided either by the AgMERRA 
climate product (Ruane et al., 2015) or local observations.  Tools and 
protocols on www.agmip.org/c3mp facilitate the simulations and 
submission of results .  To date 1138 simulation sets have been 
submitted, representing more than 50 countries, 20 crop models, and 
nearly 20 crop and pasture specie ( McDermid et al., 2015).  Additional 
results are still coming in, and the C3MP network has connected 
researchers around the world.  The C3MP protocols have also been 
adapted by AgMIP’s regional integrated assessments ( Antle et al., 
2015), Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (Elliott et al., 
2015), and AgMIP’s Livestock Modeling Team.

mean yields requires non -linearity in these responses, particularly if extremes have lower yields (on average).Figure 2 : Impacts response surfaces describing key cross -sections of emulated

AgMIP activities.Recognizing that climate change will affect agricultural systems both
through mean changes and through shifts inclimate variability and associated extreme events, wepresent preliminary
analyses ofclimate impacts from anetwork of1137 crop modeling sites contributed totheAgMIP Coordinated Climate -
Crop Modeling Project (C3MP).Ateach sitesensitivity tests were runaccording toacommon protocol, which enables the
fitting ofcrop model emulators across arange ofcarbon dioxide, temperature, and water (CTW) changes .C3MPcan
elucidate several aspects ofthese changes andquantify crop responses across awide diversity offarming systems .
Here wetest thehypothesis that climate change and variability interact inthree main ways .First ,mean climate
changes can affect yields across anentire time period .Second ,extreme events (when they dooccur) may bemore
sensitive toclimate changes than ayear with normal climate .Third ,mean climate changes can alter thelikelihood of
climate extremes, leading tomore frequent seasons with anomalies outside ofthe expected conditions forwhich
management was designed .Inthis way, shifts inclimate variability canresult inanincrease orreduction ofmean yield, as
extreme climate events tend tohave lower yield than years with normal climate .
C3MPmaize simulations across 126 farms reveal aclear indication and quantification (asresponse functions) of
mean climate impacts onmean yield andclearly show that mean climate changes willdirectly affect thevariability ofyield .
Yield reductions from increased climate variability arenotasclear ascrop models tend tobeless sensitive todangers on
thecool andwetextremes ofclimate variability, likely underestimating losses from water -logging, floods, andfrosts .
C3MP is strengthened by each additional participating scientist and contributed 
simulation set. We encourage crop modelers to test new sites with the C3MP sensitivity 
tests in order to gauge core model responses and contribute to the common archive of 
C3MP sites. 
•It is not too late to participate! We continue to accept results, although each published 
paper freezes its archive and therefore earlier submissions are likely to appear in more 
publications.
•Growth in the C3MP archive and network will increase the robustness of analyses and 
increase the potential for collaborations in the AgMIP community and beyond .
•There is currently a great amount of data in the C3MP archive and we are eager for 
more researchers to evaluate it.  We have developed several strong paper ideas, and are 
willing to share the analyses and initial outlines with interested researchers and 
students who may have more time to pursue these ideas all the way to publication.Results presented here are in preparation for submission to a journal later this year.  This 
study also suggests additional work to further understand the questions raised here:
•Historical analysis of interannual yield distributions, with particular emphasis on non -
linearities in temperature and precipitation response that may suggest anomalous years 
tend to have lower yields than the average year.  
•This research will also have implications for indicator insurance programs, which often 
target a better balance through management of this interannual yield distribution.
C3MP analyses are designed to enable rapid assessment of new climate scenarios in order 
to identify key sites that merit further study.  
We are therefore planning intercomparisons and/or assessments with the following:
•AgMIP’s Regional Integrated Assessment sites in Africa and South Asia
•Results from the AgMIP Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (which also plans to 
run C3MP -based tests on a global grid)
•C3MP response functions for integrated assessment models (IAMs) and economic models.
•Links to AgMIP’s Coordinated Global and Regional Assessment
•Results from the Coordinated Regional climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), which 
provides downscaled scenarios
•AgMIP crop model intercomparison team outputs and field trialsThe Coordinated Climate -Crop Modeling Project (C3MP) has produced a very interesting archive of 
1137 simulation sets from modeled farm systems around the world.  This provides an 
unprecedented look at climate sensitivity and uncertainties that stand in the way of a universal 
response function.  C3MP results can be used to investigate the various ways in which mean 
climate change interacts with climate variability and results in impacts on agriculture.  
Mean climate changes are the most studied factor in assessing impacts on agriculture, 
and C3MP results indicate a substantial sensitivity to changes in mean temperature, rainfall, and 
[CO2]. The 126 -member ensemble of maize simulation sets show a strong negative response to 
warming temperatures and drier conditions, with a benefit from elevated [CO2] that is fitting for a 
C4 crop.  Responses are non -linear and suggest that biophysical thresholds may increasingly 
come into play as the climate warms.  Similar findings for other crops are also being evaluated by 
Mavromatis et al. (in prep.).  
Warm and dry years are most sensitive to both the beneficial and detrimental impacts of 
climate change, as these are more readily pushed near the heat and water stress thresholds that 
reduce yields in the future.  In this sense climate change will be felt in the agricultural sector most 
acutely when heat waves and droughts occur on top of a changing baseline of warmer and drier 
conditions.  Preliminary evaluations also indicate that growing seasons with extreme climates 
have lower average yields than those that experience a typical growing season’s climate, 
suggesting that an increase in climate variability alone would be enough to reduce mean yields 
over an extended period of time.  Simulations likely underestimate this effect as damages from wet 
and cool conditions appear to be lower than expected.•Methodology : The C3MP emulator approach may also be applied to sensitivity test metrics beyond the 30 -year mean yield.  In the above plots we have first examined the 1980 -2009 climate data for 
each simulation set to identify the 3 years that are warmest, coolest, driest, and wettest.  These represent extreme years fr om the historical record.  As sensitivity tests were created by imposing mean 
changes on historical data, these same extremes exist in each sensitivity test, allowing us to track these extreme years’ yie ldsacross the entire CTW sensitivity space.  By fitting an emulator to each set 
of extreme years we are therefore able to create impacts response surfaces for different types of years, as shown in Figures 4 and 5.•Recent observations and modeling studies have suggested a link between climate 
change and an increase in variability in major agricultural regions (e.g., Francis and 
Vavrus , 2012).  Even beyond the effects of mean climate change and interactions between 
climate change and extreme event impacts on crop yields, the potential of climate change 
to affect mean yields simply by increasing climate variability is a different dimension of 
impact that we explore here.  As farmers weigh mean climate heavily in their selection of 
cultivars and management practices, anomalous years are hypothesized to produce 
lower yields and therefore more variable climate would reduce yields over a long period.

•Although somewhat subtle, results indicate that dry years tend to benefit more from increased CO2
concentrations than do the average year.  This is consistent with the experimentally -observed 
increase in water -use efficiency from improved stomatal gas exchanges in elevated [CO2] 
environments.  A similar benefit is seen in the warmest years’ response to increased CO2, as there is 
likely a strong correlation between hot and dry years and both heat waves and droughts increase 
evapotranspiration demand and resulting water stress.

•Results indicate that mean climate change will not affect all years equally, with years that 
tend to be warm and dry more dramatically affected by climate than the average year.  Cool 
and wet years tend to have a muted response to mean climate change.  Together, these 
responses indicate that climate changes toward warmer and drier conditions will reduce mean 
yield but also increase yield variability, with the most detrimental impacts occurring when 
future hot or dry extremes occur on top of a climate that is already trending in that direction.a)
