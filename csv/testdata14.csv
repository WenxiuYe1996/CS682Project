high-quality fresh water. These characteristics promote its 
widespread development, which can be scaled and local -
ized to demand, obviating the need for substantial infrastructure1. 
Globally, ground water is the source of one third of all fresh -
water withdrawals, supplying an estimated 36%, 42% and 27% 
of the water used for domestic, agricultural and industrial pur -
poses, respectively2. In many environments, natural groundwater 
discharges sustain baseflow to rivers, lakes and wetlands during 
periods of low or no rainfall. Despite these vital contributions to 
human welfare and aquatic ecosystems, a paucity of studies on the 
relationship between climate and ground water severely restricted 
the ability of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) to assess interactions between ground water and climate 
change in both its third3 and fourth4 assessment reports. There has 
since been a marked rise in published research5–8 applying local- 
to global-scale modelling, as well as ground-based and satellite 
monitoring, which has considerably enhanced our understanding 
of interactions between ground water and climate. Here we build 
on  an earlier broad-based overview8 of the topic, and examine 
substantial recent advances. These include emerging knowledge 
of the direct and indirect (through groundwater use) effects of 
climate forcing — including climate extremes — on groundwater 
resources, as well as feedbacks between ground water and climate, 
such as the contribution of groundwater depletion to global sea-
level rise. Furthermore, we identify critical gaps in our under -
standing of the interactions between ground water and climate.
Influence of climate on groundwater systems
Climate variability and change influences groundwater systems 
both directly through replenishment by recharge and indirectly 
through changes in groundwater use. These impacts can be modi -
fied by human activity such as land-use change (LUC).
Palaeohydrological evidence.  The long-term responses of ground 
water to climate forcing, largely independent of human activity, 
can be detected from palaeohydrological evidence from regional 
aquifer systems in semi-arid and arid parts of the world (Fig. 1). 
Much of the ground water flowing in large sedimentary aquifers 
of the central United States (High Plains aquifer), Australia (Great 
Artesian basin), southern Africa (Kalahari sands) and North Africa 
(Nubian sandstone aquifer system) was recharged by precipitation 
thousands of years ago10–13. As evaporation and plant transpira -
tion consume soil moisture but leave chloride behind, substantial Ground water and climate change
Richard G. T aylor  et al. *
As the world’s largest distributed store of fresh water, ground water plays a central part in sustaining ecosystems and enabling 
human adaptation to climate variability and change. The strategic importance of ground water for global water and food secu -
rity will probably intensify under climate change as more frequent and intense climate extremes (droughts and floods) increase 
variability in precipitation, soil moisture and surface water. Here we critically review recent research assessing the impacts of 
climate on ground water through natural and human-induced processes as well as through groundwater-driven feedbacks on 
the climate system. Furthermore, we examine the possible opportunities and challenges of using and sustaining groundwater 
resources in climate adaptation strategies, and highlight the lack of groundwater observations, which, at present, limits our 
understanding of the dynamic relationship between ground water and climate.
accumulations of chloride in unsaturated soil profiles within these 
basins indicate that little (≤5 mm yr−1) or no recharge has since 
taken place14; which is the case across many of the basins. Stable 
isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen, together with concentrations of 
noble gases,  suggest that recharge occurred under cooler climates 
(≥5  °C cooler) before and occasionally during Late Pleistocene 
glaciation, with further local additions during the Early Holocene. 
Ground water that was recharged during cooler, wetter climates of 
the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene (≥5,000 years bp) is com -
monly referred to as ‘fossil ground water’ . As current groundwater 
recharge rates are responsible for at most a tiny fraction of total 
groundwater storage, fossil aquifers are storage dominated rather 
than recharge-flux dominated15. As such, their lifespan is deter -
mined by the rate of groundwater abstraction relative to exploit -
able storage. In these systems, robust estimates of groundwater 
storage and accurate records of groundwater withdrawals are of 
critical importance. Although fossil aquifers provide a reliable 
source of ground water that is resilient to current climate variabil -
ity, this non-renewable groundwater exploitation is unsustainable 
and is mined in a manner similar to oil16.
Direct impacts.  Natural  replenishment of ground water occurs 
from both diffuse rain-fed recharge and focused recharge via leak -
age from surface waters (that is, ephemeral streams, wetlands or 
lakes) and is highly dependent on prevailing climate as well as 
on land cover and underlying geology. Climate and land cover 
largely determine precipitation and evapotranspiration, whereas 
the underlying soil and geology (Fig.  1) dictate whether a water 
surplus (precipitation minus evapotranspiration)  can be transmit -
ted and stored in the subsurface. Modelled estimates of diffuse 
recharge globally17,18 range from 13,000 to 15,000 km3 yr−1, equiva -
lent to ~30% of the world’s renewable freshwater resources19 or a 
mean per capita groundwater recharge of 2,100 to 2,500 m3 yr−1. 
These estimates represent potential recharge fluxes as they are 
based on a water surplus rather than measured contributions to 
aquifers. Furthermore, these modelled global recharge fluxes do 
not include focused recharge, which, in semi-arid environments, 
can be substantial14,20.
Spatial variability in modelled recharge is related primarily to 
the distribution of global precipitation17,18. Over time, recharge 
is strongly influenced by climate variability — including climate 
extremes (droughts and floods) that are often related to modes of 
climate variability such as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 
at multiyear timescales and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Atlantic

During the recent multi-annual Millennium Drought in Australia, 
groundwater storage in the Murray–Darling basin declined sub -
stantially and continuously by ~100 ± 35 km3 from 2000 to 2007 in 
response to a sharp reduction in recharge23. In tropical Africa, 
heavy rainfall has been found to contribute disproportionately to 
recharge observed in borehole hydrographs21,24. Recharge in semi-
arid environments is often restricted to statistically extreme (heavy) 
rainfall17,25 that commonly generates focused recharge beneath 
ephemeral surface water bodies20,21,26. Recharge from heavy rain -
fall events is also associated with microbial contamination of shal -
low groundwater-fed water supplies and outbreaks of diarrhoeal 
diseases in both low- and high-income countries27. Wetter condi -
tions do not, however, always produce more groundwater recharge. 
Incidences of greater (×2.5) winter precipitation in the southwest 
United States  during ENSO years give rise to enhanced evapotran -
spiration from desert blooms that largely or entirely consume the 
water surplus28.
At high latitudes and elevations, global warming changes the 
spatial and temporal distribution of snow and ice. Warming results 
in less  snow accumulation and earlier melting of snow, as well as 
in more winter precipitation in the form of rain and an increased 
frequency of rain-on-snow events. The aggregate impact of these 
effects on recharge is not well resolved, but preliminary evidence29,30 
indicates that changes in snowmelt regimes tend to reduce the sea -
sonal duration and magnitude of recharge. Aquifers in mountain 
valleys show shifts in the timing and magnitude of: (1) peak ground -
water levels due to an earlier spring melt; and (2) low groundwater 
levels associated with longer and lower baseflow periods31 (Fig. 2). 
Summer low flows in streams may be exacerbated by declining 
groundwater levels, so that stream flow becomes inadequate to 
meet domestic and agricultural water requirements and to maintain ecological functions such as in-stream habitats for fish and other 
aquatic species31. The effects of receding alpine glaciers on ground -
water systems are also not well understood, yet the long-term loss of 
glacial storage is estimated to reduce similarly summer baseflow32. 
In the glaciated watersheds of the Himalayas, the impacts of large 
reductions in glacial mass and increased evaporation on groundwa -
ter recharge are projected to be offset by a rise in precipitation33. In 
permafrost regions, where recharge is at present ignored in global 
analyses17, coupling between surface-water and groundwater sys -
tems may be particularly enhanced by warming34. In areas of sea -
sonal or perennial ground frost, increased recharge is expected even 
though the absolute snow volume decreases35.
Human and indirect climate impacts.  Links between climate and 
ground water in the modern era are complicated by LUC, which 
includes, most pervasively, the expansion of rain-fed and irrigated 
agriculture. Managed agro-ecosystems do not respond to changes 
in precipitation in the same manner as natural ecosystems. Indeed, 
LUC may exert a stronger influence on terrestrial hydrology than 
climate change. During multi-decadal droughts in the West 
African Sahel in the latter half of the twentieth century, groundwa -
ter recharge and storage rose rather than declined owing to a coin -
cidental LUC from savannah to cropland that increased surface 
runoff through soil crusting and focused recharge via ephemeral 
ponds36. Much earlier in the twentieth century, LUC from natu -
ral ecosystems to rain-fed cropland in southeast Australia and the 
southwest United States similarly increased groundwater storage 
through increased recharge, but also degraded groundwater qual -
ity through the mobilization of salinity accumulated in unsatu -
rated soil profiles14. In both regions, recharge rates under cropland 
increased by one to two orders of magnitude37–39 compared with 
native perennial vegetation. North W est

water system through irrigation (Fig.  2). In 2000, irrigation 
accounted for ~70% of global freshwater withdrawals and ~90% 
of consumptive water use2. This large-scale redistribution of fresh 
water from rivers, lakes and ground water to arable land (Fig. 2) 
has led to: (1) groundwater depletion in regions with primarily 
groundwater-fed irrigation; (2) groundwater accumulation as a 
result of recharge from return flows from surface-water-fed irriga -
tion; and (3) changes in surface-energy budgets associated with 
enhanced soil moisture from irrigation. Irrigation has depleted 
groundwater storage in several semi-arid and arid environments 
including the North China Plain40, northwest India41 and the US 
High Plains42,43, but also in humid environments in Brazil44 and 
Bangladesh45 (Fig.  1) where abstraction is especially intense. 
During a recent (2006 to 2009) drought in the California Central 
Valley (Fig. 1), large-scale groundwater depletion occurred when 
the source of irrigation water shifted from surface water to predom -
inantly ground water. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment 
(GRACE) satellite data and ground-based observations revealed 
that groundwater storage declined by between 24 and 31 km3, a 
volume that is equivalent to the storage capacity of Lake Mead, the 
largest surface reservoir in the United States46,47. Thus, the indi -
rect effects of climate on ground water through changes in irriga -
tion demand and sources can be greater than the direct impacts 
of climate on recharge. Global-scale modelling2 highlights areas 
of recent (1998  to 2002) groundwater accumulation through 
irrigation return flows from surface-water-fed irrigation in the 
Nile basin of Egypt, Tigris–Euphrates basin of Iraq, Syria and 
Turkey, the lower Indus basin in Pakistan, and southeastern China 
(Fig.  3). In parts of the California Central Valley, surface-water 
irrigation since the 1960s has increased groundwater recharge by 
a factor of approximately seven, replenishing previously depleted 
aquifers and raising groundwater levels by up to 100 m (ref. 48). 
Increased recharge may not only degrade groundwater quality 
through the mobilization of salinity in soil profiles (discussed 
earlier) but also flush natural contaminants such as arsenic from 
groundwater systems49,50.
Future climate impacts on groundwater systems.  As irrigation 
dominates current groundwater use and depletion, the effects of 
future climate variability and change on ground water may be great -
est through indirect effects on irrigation-water demand. Substantial 
uncertainty persists about the impacts of climate change on mean 
precipitation from general circulation models (GCMs)51, but there 
is much greater consensus on changes in precipitation and tem -
perature extremes, which are projected to increase with intensifica -
tion of the global hydrological system52,53. Longer droughts may be 
interspersed with more frequent and intense rainfall events. These 
changes in climate may affect ground water initially and primar -
ily through changes in irrigation demand, in addition to changes 
in recharge and discharge. A global analysis of the effects of climate 
change on irrigation demand suggests that two thirds of the irri -
gated area in 1995 will be subjected to increased water requirements 
for irrigation by 2070 (ref.  54). Projected increases in irrigation 
demand in southern Europe will serve to stress limited groundwater 
resources further55. Persistent droughts projected in the California 
Central Valley over the latter half of the twenty-first century may 
trigger a shift from a predominantly surface-water to a predomi -
nantly groundwater supply for agriculture56. Increased groundwater 
abstraction combined with reduced surface-water flows associated 
with intermittent droughts during the first half of the twenty-first 
century may, however, induce secondary effects (for example, land 
subsidence) that severely constrain this future adaptation strategy.
Projections of the direct impacts of climate change on ground -
water systems are highly uncertain. The dominant source of 
uncertainty lies in climate projections derived from GCMs, which typically translate the same emissions scenarios into very different 
climate scenarios, particularly for precipitation51. Nevertheless, 
GCM projections of global precipitation for the twenty-first cen -
tury broadly indicate a ‘rich get richer’ pattern in which regions of 
moisture convergence (or divergence) are expected to experience 
increased (or decreased) precipitation52,57. There are no published 
studies applying a large ensemble of GCMs and greenhouse-gas 
emissions scenarios to generate recharge projections at the global 
scale. Global simulations using output from two climate models 
(ECHAM4, HadCM3) under two emissions scenarios (A2, B2) 
project: (1) decreases in potential groundwater recharge of more 
than 70% by the 2050s in northeast Brazil, southwest Africa and 
along the southern rim of the Mediterranean Sea; and (2) increases 
in potential recharge of more than 30% in the Sahel, Middle East, 
northern China, Siberia and the western United States17. Baseline 
recharge rates in many of these areas are, however, very low, so that 
small changes in projected recharge can result in large percentage 
changes. For most of the areas with high population densities and 
high sensitivity to groundwater recharge reductions, model results 
indicated that groundwater recharge is unlikely to decrease by more 
than 10% until the 2050s19.
Groundwater recharge projections are closely related to pro -
jected changes in precipitation. Regional simulations using 16 
GCMs in Australia project potential recharge decreases in the west, 
central and south, and increases in the north based on the ensemble 
median57. In Europe, potential recharge projections derived from an 
ensemble of four GCMs demonstrate strong latitudinal dependence 
on the direction of the climate change signal58. Substantial reduc -
tions in potential groundwater recharge are projected in southern 
Europe (Spain and northern Italy) whereas increases are consist -
ently projected in northern Europe (Denmark, southern England, 
northern France). Current uncertainty about the impacts of climate 
on recharge derive not only from the substantial uncertainty in 
GCM projections of precipitation but also from that associated with 
the downscaling of GCM projections and the hydrological models 
used59. For a chalk aquifer in England, for example, application of 
an ensemble of 13 GCMs resulted in projected changes in ground -
water recharge for the 2080s of between −26% and +31% (ref. 60).

© 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved4 NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE  | ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION | www.nature.com/natureclimatechangeIn southern British Columbia, recharge projections for the 2080s 
range from −10% to +23% relative to historical recharge61. At three 
Australian sites, the choice of GCMs was found to be the great -
est source of uncertainty in future recharge projections, followed 
by that of downscaling and then the applied hydrological model, 
amounting to 53, 44 and 24% of historical recharge, respectively62. 
Uncertainty from downscaling can be greater than uncertainty due 
to the choice of applied emissions scenarios63,64.
Current projections of groundwater recharge under climate 
change commonly do not consider the intensification of precipita -
tion and physiological forcing of carbon dioxide (CO2). Although 
precipitation intensity is of critical importance to recharge, his -
torical daily rainfall distributions are typically used to downscale 
monthly rainfall projections to a daily timestep. Evidence from 
the tropics65, where the intensification of precipitation is expected 
to be especially strong, reveals that failure to consider changes in 
daily rainfall distributions can systemically underestimate future 
recharge. Transformation of the rainfall distribution to account for 
changes in rainfall intensity reversed a projected 55% decline in 
potential recharge to a 53% increase. Recent multi-model simu -
lations that account for precipitation intensification66 represent a 
critical advance in assessing climate change impacts on groundwa -
ter recharge and terrestrial water balances. Under higher atmos -
pheric CO2 concentrations, terrestrial plants open their stomata 
less; this response is projected to reduce evapotranspiration and 
increase continental runoff67. Recent analyses in Australia68 show 
that: (1) greater plant growth (and consequently greater leaf area) 
can offset reductions in evapotranspiration through stomatal 
closure; (2) reduced leaf area due to unfavourable climate condi -
tions can result in an increase of groundwater recharge even with 
slightly decreased rainfall; and (3) changes in rainfall intensity can 
have a greater impact on recharge fluxes than rising atmospheric 
CO2 concentrations.
Groundwater impacts on the climate system
Ground water influences climate through contributions to soil 
moisture and global sea-level rise (SLR). Recent effors to describe 
and quantify these effects are described below.
Groundwater-fed irrigation and soil moisture.  Irrigation 
can transform areas from moisture-limited to energy-limited evapotranspiration, thereby influencing water and energy budgets. 
A modelling study69 estimated that during the growing season, 
averaged over the continental United States, irrigation increases 
evapotranspiration by 4%. Simulations show that rising ground -
water-fed irrigation in the High Plains (Fig. 1) over the twentieth 
century increased downwind precipitation by ≤15% to 30% in the 
month of July70, with associated increases in groundwater storage 
and streamflow observed from August to September71. Irrigation 
in California’s Central Valley has strengthened the southwestern 
US monsoon, increasing precipitation by 15% and discharge of the 
Colorado River by 30% (ref. 72). Similar impacts of groundwater-
fed irrigation on evapotranspiration and downwind precipitation 
have been demonstrated in the Indian monsoon region using a 
regional climate model73.
Ground water in land-surface models . Land-surface models 
(LSMs), embedded in GCMs, have neglected hydrological pro -
cesses below the root zone such as lateral groundwater flow, as 
these have been assumed to be disconnected from the atmosphere. 
LSMs were subsequently retrofitted with a simplified formulation 
of unconfined groundwater storage changes74. There have also 
been attempts to represent subsurface processes better in LSMs75 
or to couple more complete groundwater models to LSMs76. 
These efforts led to the discovery of a critical zone of water-table 
depths from 2 to 7 m, where groundwater exerts the most influ -
ence on land-energy fluxes77. Coupling of an integrated hydro -
logical model to mesoscale atmospheric models78 revealed clear 
connections between water-table depth and development of the 
atmospheric boundary layer79. Representing groundwater flow in 
atmospheric models at larger scales and longer time frames affects 
land-surface moisture states that feed back into regional climate 
where water tables are relatively shallow80. Without a prognostic 
groundwater reservoir and explicit groundwater–surface-water 
exchanges in LSMs, we remain unable to represent the integrated 
response of the water cycle to human perturbations and climate 
change. One key groundwater process missing from LSMs is lat -
eral groundwater flow. This flow occurs at multiple spatial scales81 
but is fundamentally important at hill-slope (or small model grid) 
scales in a humid climate or at basin scales in semi-arid and arid 
climates with regional aquifers where discharges can be remote 
from sources of recharge82. Lateral groundwater flow supports per -
sistently wetter river valleys in humid climates, and regional wet -
lands and oases in arid climates80, affecting land-surface moisture 
states and evapotranspiration fluxes. Ground water also acts as an 
important store and vehicle for carbon, although studies account -
ing for groundwater interactions and feedbacks in the global car -
bon budget are still in their infancy83.
Groundwater and sea-level rise.  Coastal aquifers form the inter -
face between the oceanic and terrestrial hydrological systems and 
provide a source of water for the more than one billion people liv -
ing in coastal regions84. Global SLR of  1.8 mm yr−1 over the second 
half of the twentieth century85 is expected to have induced fresh–
saline-water interfaces to move inland. The extent of seawater intru -
sion into coastal aquifers depends on a variety of factors including 
coastal topography, recharge, and groundwater abstraction from 
coastal aquifers86,87. Analytical models suggest that the impact of 
SLR on seawater intrusion is negligible compared to that of ground -
water abstraction87. The effects of seawater intrusion have been 
observed most prominently in association with intensive ground -
water abstraction around areas with high population densities (for 
example, Bangkok, Jakarta, Gaza)88,89. Coastal aquifers under very 
low hydraulic gradients, such as the Asian mega-deltas, are theo -
retically sensitive to SLR but, in practice, are expected in coming 
decades to be more severely affected by saltwater inundation from 
storm surges than SLR87.

Note that in areas with predominantly groundwater-fed irrigation or 
significant water withdrawals for domestic and industrial purposes, no 
anthropogenic groundwater recharge occurs; a net abstraction of ground 
water leads to groundwater depletion in regions with insufficient natural 
groundwater recharge.REVIEW ARTICLE NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE  DOI: 10.1038/NCLIMATE1744

of fresh water from long-term terrestrial groundwater storage to 
active circulation near the earth’s surface and its eventual transfer 
to oceanic stores. The contribution of groundwater depletion to SLR 
has, however, been a subject of debate. In the IPCC fourth assess -
ment report90, the contribution of non-frozen terrestrial waters, 
including groundwater depletion, to sea-level variation was not 
specified owing to its perceived uncertainty. Recently, there has 
been a series of studies estimating the contribution of groundwa -
ter depletion to SLR18,91–93. Current estimates of global groundwater 
depletion derived from flux-based (year 2000) and volume-based 
(period, 2001–2008) methods are summarized in Table  1. Global 
groundwater depletion (204 ± 30 km3 yr−1) estimated by the flux-
based method91 derives from the difference between grid-based 
simulated groundwater recharge and net abstraction (that is 
groundwater withdrawals minus return flows). This approach over -
estimates depletion as it does not account for increased capture due 
to decreased groundwater discharge and long-distance surface-
water transfers. The volume-based method92 combines evidence 
of groundwater storage changes for the United States and another 
five aquifer systems (Indo-Gangetic plain, North China plain, Saudi 
Arabia, Nubian sandstone and North West Sahara) (Fig. 1), and then 
extrapolates groundwater depletion elsewhere using the average 
ratio of depletion to abstraction observed in the United States. This 
approach produces a lower global estimate of groundwater deple -
tion (145 ± 39 km3 yr−1) than the flux-based approach. Both meth -
ods reveal that groundwater depletion is most pronounced in Asia 
(China, India) and North America (Table 1). The different estimates 
of global groundwater depletion produce variable estimates of its 
current contribution to SLR (34% or 0.57 ± 0.09 mm yr−1 versus 23% 
or 0.4 ± 0.1 mm yr−1). Direct observations of groundwater depletion 
continue to be hampered by a dearth of ground-based observations, 
which not only limits our understanding of localized groundwa -
ter storage changes but also our ability to constrain evidence from 
GRACE satellite observations at larger scales (≥150,000 km2).
A look forward
Ground water can enhance the resilience of domestic, agricultural 
and industrial uses of fresh water in the face of climate variability 
and change. As the only perennial source of fresh water in many 
regions, ground water is of vital importance to the water security 
of many communities, including — most critically — rural dwell -
ers in low-income countries. Groundwater-fed irrigation provides 
a buffer against climate extremes and is consequently essential 
to global food security. Furthermore, it alleviates poverty in low-
income countries by reducing crop failure and increasing yields94. 
The value of ground water is expected to increase in coming decades 
as temporal variabilities in precipitation, soil moisture and surface 
water are projected to increase under more frequent and intense cli -
mate extremes associated with climate change53. Indeed, in light of the resilience of groundwater resources to hydrological extremes, 
ground water could have a strategic role in sustaining drinking-
water supplies under emergency conditions95.
As detailed earlier, substantial doubt remains about the projected 
impacts of climate change on diffuse groundwater recharge, which 
is associated with the inherent uncertainties in climate projections96 
and terrestrial responses to changing precipitation and land cover.  
More certain are rises in groundwater abstraction in absolute terms 
and as a proportion of total water withdrawals, which threaten to 
overexploit groundwater resources. This risk is particularly acute in 
semi-arid regions where projected increases in the frequency and 
intensity of droughts, combined with rising populations and stand -
ards of living as well as the projected expansion of irrigated land, 
will intensify groundwater demand. To sustain groundwater use 
under these conditions will require careful aquifer management97 
that: (1) is informed by integrated models able to consider the range 
of interactions between ground water, climate and human activity 
(summarized in Fig. 2); and (2) exploits opportunities for enhanced 
groundwater recharge associated with less frequent but heavier 
rainfall events and changing meltwater regimes. 
Comprehensive management approaches to water resources 
that integrate ground water and surface water may greatly reduce 
human vulnerability to climate extremes and change, and promote 
global water and food security. Conjunctive uses of ground water 
and surface water that use surface water for irrigation and water 
supply during wet periods, and ground water during drought48, 
are likely to prove essential. Recognition of current uncertainty 
in water resource projections and the longer residence time (dec -
adal to multigenerational) of fresh water in groundwater systems 
will be critical in setting sustainability goals97. Managed aqui -
fer recharge wherein excess surface water, desalinated water and 
treated waste water are stored in depleted aquifers could also sup -
plement groundwater storage for use during droughts43,98. Indeed, 
the use of aquifers as natural storage reservoirs avoids many of the 
problems of evaporative losses and ecosystem impacts associated 
with large, constructed surface-water reservoirs. In South Asia, for 
example, intensive groundwater abstraction for dry-season irriga -
tion has induced greater recharge in areas with permeable soils by 
increasing available groundwater storage during the subsequent 
monsoon99. In northern Europe, capture of projected increases in 
groundwater recharge during winter may help to sustain anticipated 
increases in summer demand58. Explicit representation in GCMs of 
groundwater storage, its interactions with surface-water stores, and 
anthropogenic perturbations  — such as large-scale groundwater-
fed irrigation — is required to advance our understanding of both 
the influence of ground water on climate and the impact of climate 
change on global freshwater resources.
A fundamental impediment to using the adaptation strategies 
discussed earlier is the lack of groundwater observations to inform 
them. Since 2002, GRACE satellite observations have provided T able  1 | Estimates of global- and continental-scale groundwater depletion.

© 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved6 NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE  | ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION | www.nature.com/natureclimatechangevaluable information on recent groundwater storage changes at 
basin scales, but ground-based data are essential to constrain sat -
ellite observations and to inform local groundwater responses to 
climate and abstraction. The Global Groundwater Monitoring 
Network (GGMN), initiated in 2007 by the UNESCO International 
Hydrological Programme (IHP) International Groundwater 
Resources Assessment Centre to facilitate the sharing of groundwa -
ter information globally, has begun collating data sets from publicly 
accessible sources and via participatory processes. The first global 
maps of groundwater resources were compiled in 2004 (ref.  9), 
and ground water has recently been incorporated into the Global 
Earth Observation System of Systems. Nevertheless, the availabil -
ity of groundwater data (for example, groundwater levels and with -
drawals) remains limited. As a result, our ability to evaluate fully 
the responses of ground water to climate variability and change, 
to estimate directly groundwater replenishment, and to constrain 
models and satellite observations, is severely impaired. There is, for 
example, a profound lack of knowledge regarding the quantity of 
groundwater storage in most aquifers that may be sustainably used. 
The equivalent depth of groundwater storage, determined primarily 
by geology, can vary substantially from regional sedimentary aqui -
fers (>50 m) to small, discontinuous aquifers in deeply weathered 
crystalline rock (<1 m) that lie under 40% of sub-Saharan Africa100. 
An expansion of groundwater monitoring, together with increased 
contributions of data to the GGMN, are necessary to improve access 
to groundwater data globally and promote the inclusion of ground 
water in the assessment and management of freshwater resources 
under climate change.
