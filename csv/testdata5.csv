Physical Processes Controlling Earth's Climate 
Anthony D. Del Genio

As background for consideration of the climates of the other terrestrial planets in our solar 
system and the potential habitability of rocky exoplanets. we discuss the basic physics that 
controls the Earth's present climate. with particular emphasis on the energy and water cycles. 
We define several dimensionless parameters relevant to characterizing a planet's general cir­
culation. climate. and hydrological cycle. We also consider issues associated with the use of 
past climate variations as indicators of future anthropogenically forced climate change. and 
recent advances in understanding projections of future climate that might have implications 
for Earth-like exoplanets . 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The amazing diversity of atmospheric behavior seen in 
our own solar system represents a challenge to our funda­
mental understanding of atmosphe ric physics. The weather 
and climate of Earth, explored extensively during the past 
century, provide an invaluable basis for understand ing this 
diversity. Yet Earth's atmosphere occupies only one part of 
the parameter space of factors that can affect weather and 
climate. The extent to which our terrestrial assumptions 
carry over to other planets must continually be evaluated. 
A planetary perspective on Earth can help us decide which 
features that we take for granted are unique to our planet 
and which it has in common with subsets of other planets. 
The rapidly growing list of discovered exoplanets, and the 
need to assess which of these mighllie in the habitable zone 
(see Domagal-Go ldman and Segura. this volume). stretches 
our assumed understanding of Earth. Furthermore. increas­
ing evidence of conditions during Earth's own past, as well 
as the urgency to be able to predict important features of 
future anthropogenically forced climate change, has led to a 
resurgence in fundamenlal studies of E.'l.rth's present climate 
in recent years. The science of comparative planetary clima­
tology is indeed coupled to queslions of our own planet's 
past and future habitability (see Foreword to this volume). 
Although there is still much we do nOl understand 
about our own climate system, orders of magnitude more 
theoretical, observational, and modeling effort has been 
devoted to our planetllian any other. Thus, for solar system 
or exoplanet researchers reading this book. we hope that 
starting with a discussion of Earth will provide a useful, 
even necessary. foundation for thinking about conditions 
on other planets. For terrestrial scientists, we hope that the 
planetary perspective of Earth presented in this chapter 
will stimulate thinking about the features that make Earth 
unique in our solar system. The lime has never been riper 
for such thinking, since the advent of general circulation 
3 models (GCMs) (see Dowling, this volume) run on high­
pcrfonnance computing platforms now makes it possible 
to ask almost any imaginable ""What if ... 1"" question 
about Earth and the physics that control its climate. This 
chapter assumes a knowledge of basic atmospheric science; 
derivations and further discussion of many of the principles 
presented here can be found in textbooks such as HOllghtoll 
(2002) and Wallace and Hobbs (2006). 
2. THE ENERGY AND WATER CYCLES 
New estimates of the solar irradiance of Earth (KOIJP 
and Lean. 2011) indicate a value So = 1360.8 W/m2 at 
solar minimum. considerably lower than previous estimates 
(see Harder and Woods, this volume). This so-called solar 
constant actually fluctuates by -0.1 W/m2 over the II-year 
solar cycle. an inconsequential variation for Earth's climate. 
Averaged over the Earth, the absorbed shortwave (SW) flux 
equals the emitted longwave (LW) flux in equilibrium (see 
Covey et a\., this volume): 
S, (1-A) 
4d2 aT' , (1 ) 
where A = 0.293 is the planetary albedo (Loeb el al .. 
2009), d the planet-Sun distance in astronomical units (=1 
for Earth). 0' the Stefan-Bo ltzmann constant. and Te the 
effective temperature of a blackbody that would produce 
the observed LW flux. Actually. Earth is currently out of 
equilibrium by -0.6 W/Ill'2 due to anthropogenic emissions 
of greenhouse gases and other climate forcings (Lyman et 
a/ .. 2010). 
Figure I shows the contributions to the global energy 
balance at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA). within the atmos­
pheric column. and at the surface (Stephells et a/.. 2012). 
Clouds account for almost half of Earth's planetary albedo; 
the other half is made up of almost equal contributions from 4 ComparUlh·t C/imQl%gy ofTtrrutrial Planets

the clear atmosphere (aerosol scattering and gaseous Ray· 
leigh scattering) and the surface. The outgoing LW flux to 
space comes almost entirely from the atmosphere, with only 
an 8% contribution from the surface thai escapes through 
the atmosphe ric thennal infrared window. Even in clear 
skies. the surface only contribute s -25% of the emission 
to space because of the LW opacity of greenhouse gases 
(Costa and Shille. 2012). 
Earth's atmosphere is fairly transparent to our Sun's 
radiation. which peaks in the visible; -22% is absorbed 
within the atmosphere, primarily due to O2 and 0) in the 
ultraviolet, H20 in the near-infrared. and absorbing aero­
sols in the visible. The SW flux that reaches the surface is 
primarily (-88%) absorbed . The surface energy budget is 
balanced largely by upward surface turbulent latent and heal 
fluxes and partly by the net (up-down) LW flux (see Show­
man et aI., this volume). The LW contribution is secondary 
because atmospheric absorbers induce a downward LW flux 
that offsets much orthe upward emission from the surface. 
Tc in equation (I) = 255 K, 33 K colder than Earth's 
surface temperature T, = 288 K. The difference is a measure 
of Earth's greenhouse effect (see Covey et al.. this volume) 
due to LW absorbers. Water vapor accounts for -50% of 
the greenhouse effect. followed by clouds (-25%), CO2 
(-19%), and other absorbing gases and particulates (-7%) 
(Schmidt et ai .• 2010). These relative contribution s obscure 
the fact that CO2 is actually the primary driver of Earth's 
climate, since water vapor is controlled (largely via the 
Clausius-Clapeyron equation of thermodynami cs) by the 
heating due to CO2 and other noncondensable greenhouse 
gases (Locis et ai"" 2010). Figure 2, for example, shows 
that when CO2 and other noncondensable greenhouse 
gases are removed from an Earth GCM, the planet cools by _35°C and the water vapor content is reduced by 90%. 
On Titan (see Griffith et a!., this volume), the noncondens­
able absorber H2 exerts a similar control on the climate by 
regulating the concentra tion of the condensable gas CH4 
(McKay el al .• 1991). 
Figure 3 shows the geographic distribution of the 
TOA absorbed SW and outgoing LW flux in clear skies.

and the difference between that and the total fluxes in all 
conditions, known as the ""cloud forcing"" or ""cloud radia­
tive effect"" (Loeb el 01., 2009). The clear sky SW flull is 
dominated by the solar zenith angle variation with latitude. 
but departure s from the zonal mean at each latitude reveal 
radiatively important details of Earth's surface: minima 
over bright ice-covered Greenland and Antarctica and to a 
lesser extent over the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice packs. 
maxima over the dark oceans, and inlemlediate values over 
other land surfaces. 
The other fluxes are regulated primarily by the atmos­
phere and are thus indicators of the general circulation. 
Earth's ""tropical"" and ""extralropical""' dynamical regimes 
are determined by its radius, rotation period, and ther­
modynamic structure (see Showman et al., this volume). 
Low-level moisture co~verge nce and deep convection in the 
rising branch of the Hadley cell maximize the greenhouse 
effect near the equalOr and produce a minimum in clear sky 
LW flux to space there relative to the flux maxima in the 
surroundin g subtropical dry subsidence regions. Otherwise 
the clear sky flux reflects primarily the decrease in tempera­
ture and water vapor with latitude. Longwave cloud forcing 
(which is positive because clouds reduce LW emission to 
space and thus warm the planet) peaks coincide with the 
tropical locations of deep convection; secondary maxima exist in the exuatropical storm tracks. Shortwave cloud 
forcing (which is negative because clouds are brighter than 
most of Earth's surface and thus cool the planet) also is 
large in magnitude in these regions. Other SW cloud forc­
ing maxima exist off the west coasts of the continents but 
with no corresponding LW signal. These are locations of 
low-level marine stratocumulus decks whose tops are below 
the clear sky emission to space level. Globally averaged, 
SW cooling by clouds exceeds LW warming by -17 W/m2. 
i.e., the net effect of clouds is to cool the current climate. 
Aerosols (Fig. 4) have three qualitatively different effects 
on the climate: (I) Direcl effects due to their interaction 
with (mostly SW) radiation (M)'hre, 2009). Since most aero­
sol types (sulfates, nitrates. sea salt, and organic carbon) are 
bright. they cool Earth. However, black carbon and mineral 
dust absorb SW radiation; this cools the surface by prevent­
ing sunlight from reaching it but warms the atmosphere 
and the planel as a whole. This is analogous 10 Ihe ""anti­
greenhouse"" effect of absorbing hydrocarbo n hazes on Titan 
(McKay et al., 1991; Griffith et al., this volume), but with a 
smaller magnitude. (2) Indirect effects due to the interaction 
of aerosols with clouds (McComiskey and Feingold, 2012). 
Aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and affect the 
number concentration and size of cloud droplets. With an 
increase in aerosols, the available water is shared among 6 Cotnpllml;l~ Climatology ofTf!rrnlrial Planf!IS 
more but smaller droplets, increasing their area/volume ratio 
and thus making the cloud more reflective. Smaller cloud 
droplets may also affect the microphysics and dynamics of 
clouds, but the magnitud e of this effect is quite uncenain. 
(3) Semj·(Jirect effects due to the influence of warming 
by absorbing aerosols on the atmospher ic thermodynamic 
slIUcture (Koch and Del Genio, 20 I 0). For example, marine 
stratocumulu s clouds that occur under strong inversions may 
become more widespread if an absorbing aerosol advected 
from an adjacent continent increases the inversion strength. 
The geographic distribution of aerosols (Baller Cl ai.. 
20(8) is determined by natural and anthropogeni c sources, 
tropospheric chemical reactions. wet and dry deposition, and 
advection by the general circulation. Sulfate and nitrate arc 
largely of anthropogenic origin and are concentrated ncar 
and downwind of industrial. lransponation, and agricultural 
sources. Organic and black. carbon are most prevalent in 
regions of biomass burning, but also have imponant in· 
dustrial and transponalion sources. Mineral dust is mostly 
natural in origin, the largest source region being the Sahara 
and Arabian desens. Sea salt is produced mainly in oceanic 
regions of strong surface winds such as the extratropical 
storm lrncks. 
Allhough the TOA·absorbed SW and outgoing LW 
radiative fluxes must balance globally for the climate to 
be in equilibrium , this is not true locally. In fact, there is 
a latitudinall y varying imbalance of net radiative heating 
on Earth (Fig. 5): The tropics receives more sunlight than 
the heat it emilS to space, while higher latitudes emit more 
than they absorb. In equilibrium this must be offset by the 
transport of heat from low to high latitudes. This is Ihe fundamental driver of the circulations of the atmosphere 
and ocean (Trenberlh alld Caron. 2001). The atmospheric 
component of heat lrnnspon is accomplished primarily by 
the Hadley circulation in the tropics and by synoptic·scale 
eddies created by baroclinic instability in the extralropic s 
(see Showman et aI., this volume) and dominate s at high 
latitudes. The ocean circulation contribution (0 transport 
dominate s at low latitudes (Fig. 6). 
The ocean circulation has two fundamental components: 
a surface circulation in the top -100 OJ driven by the 
frictional interaction with atmospheri c surface winds and 
the Coriolis force, and a themlohaline circulation driven 
by density gradients due to temperature and salinity dif· 
ferences. The surface winds created by Earth's three·cell 
mean meridional circulation produce tropical easterly and 
extratropical westerly ocean currents. At longitudina l con­
tinental boundarie s. the easterlies are deflected poleward 
and the westerlies equatorward. fonning roughly circular 
ocean gyres in each ocean basin and hemisphere . The 
gyres transport warm water poleward off the east coasts 
of the continents and cold water equatorward ofT the west 
coasts, effecting a net poleward heat transport (Klinger 
arid Marotz}ce, 2000). The wind·driven transpon may be an 
important factor in limiting sea ice expansion to the tropics 
in ""snowball Earth"" scenarios (Poulsen and Jacob, 2004; 
Rose tmd Marshall, 2009). At high latitudes. dense (cold 
and/or salty) water sinks to the ocean bottom and slowly 
circulates to lower latitudes. High·salinity water is produced 
by net evaporation (i.e., in excess of precipitation) and the 
formation of sea ice, which cannot easily accommodate salt 
and thus produces salty ocean water where it occurs. The

adding to the poleward heat transport (Broecker, 199i). The 
removal of dense surface water to the deep ocean takes it 
out of thennal contact with the atmosphere until it returns 
to the surface at low latitudes much laler. This implies that 
the effects of changes in greenhouse gas concentrations will 
not fully be reflected in surface temperature s for centuries. 
perhaps even a millennium or more (Hansen et al., 1985). 
Stone (1978a) argued that the total meridional heat trans­
port is controlled by external parameters (solar constant. 
planet size, and obliquity ) and the planetary albedo. and 
thus that the details of partitioning between atmosphere 
and ocean are unimportant. This would be good news for 
exoplanet science. since nothing is known about possible 
oceans on exoplanets. However. Enderton and Marshall 
(2009) show that in an ideali7.ed ""aquaplanet"" Earth GCM. 
Stone's conclusion is valid only for wann. ice·free climates. 
Ferreira et al. (201 I) find that multiple equilibria. from 
ice-free to ice--covered (""snowball"") states are possible in 
such models. Figure 7 compares two versions of an Earth 
atmospheric GCM coupled to a mixed-layer ocean with 
specified ocean heat transports. One has transports calcu­
lated to produce observed sea surface temperature s -a 
""Q-flux"" model (Hansen et al., 1984) -and another has 
ocean heat transports turned off. The atmosphere has clearly 
not compensated for the absence of ocean heat transport. 
leading to much more extensive sea ice coverage and a 
clearly different climate for the same external forcing. 
Vertical heat transport is just as important in determin­
ing the Earth's climate. The simplest assumption for the 
vertical lhennodynamic structure is to assume lhat il is in 
radiative equilibrium. i.e., the temperature profile is such 
that the divergence of the radiative flux is zero at all levels.

where c is a constant that depends on the details of the mod­
el. This equation shows that a planet with all atmosphere 
containing greenhouse gases has a surface temperature that 
exceeds its effective temperature, to a greater degree as the 
atmosphere becomes optically thicker. (An exception to 
this rule is a planet such as Mars wilh large day-night TJ 
contrasts: see Rafldn et al. and Covey et ai., this volume). 
Equation (2a) can be modified to incorporate atmospheric 
SW absorption due, e.g., to an ozone layer or an absorbing 
haze (McKay el aI., 1999), giving 
(2b) 
where FJ = So(l-A)/4d2 is the SW flux absorbed by the 
planet and y is the fraction of this flux that is absorbed 
within the atmosphere (see Covey et aI., this volume). 
Equations (2a) and (2b) are not quantitatively accurate but 
capture lhe basic physics of how the atmosphere radiatively 
modulate s surface temperature. 
Models that lead to equation (2a) inherently produce a 
surface-atmosphere temperature discontinuity because the 
surface absorbs all the incident SW radiation. Furthermore , 
the Tsthey predict considerably exceeds the observed T, for 
realistic t*. More sophisticated one-dimensional radiative 
equilibrium models also indicate that the lower troposphere

applied to limit lapse rates and produces a realistic Ts and 
temperature profile. The implied upward transport of heat 
by convection reduces Ihe sensitivity of Ts 10 changes in 
atmospheric composition or insolation. 
Observation s indicate that Earth's tropical lapse rate 
in the free troposphere is close to moist adiabatic up to 
-400 hPa (Zelinka and lIartmaml. 2011). indicating that 
moist convection is the controlling process up to that level 
(Fig. 8). This is possible because over the warm tropical 
oceans. lhe boundary layer is sufficiently humid for moist 
convection 10 occur frequently enough to adjust conditionally unstable lapse rates to ncar-neutral stability. This is not the 
case over the cooler tropical ocean regions. but the weak 
tropical Coriolis force allows advection to adjust the free 
troposphere lapse rate there to a value close to that in the 
warmer ocean regions (see Showman et al .. this volume). 
Over tropical land. where moisture is not always available 
and the surface temperature responds more quickly to solar 
healing. more unstable lapse rutes can sometimes occur: con­
sequently. continenta l cOllvective updraft speeds are stronger 
than those over ocean (Zipser and Lutz. 1994). Above the

more stable than predicted by the moist adiabatic lapse rate. 
Surprisingly, extratropica l static stability (proportionai to the 
difference between the dry adiabatic and actual lapse rate) 
is not understood as well as tropical static stability despite 
our firmer understanding of extratropical quasi ·geostrophic 
dynamics. StOlle (l978b) suggested that the lapse rate is set 
by the requirement that dry baroclinic eddies associated 
with latitudinallemperature gradients adjust the atmosphere 
to a baroclinically neutral state. More recent work indicates 
that the extratropieal lapse rate is affected by synoptic 
transports by both baroclinic eddies and moist convection 
(Frierson, 2008), but there is not universal agreement on 
the details. An effective static stability that is based on 
the moist adiabat but also accounts for dry downwelling 
circulations and meridional temperature gradients appears 
to hold promise (O'Gorman, 2011). 
Equilibrium of the water cycle requires that on climate 
timescales, global mean precipitation P must balance global 
mean evaporation E. Just as for the energy cycle, though, the 
local water cycle is not balanced between sources and sinks 
(Trenberth el af., 2(07). Instead, the surface watcr balance 
E--P reflects the general circulation, with P > E in the moist 
equatorial rising branch of the Hadley cell and the extratropi· 
cal stom\ uacks. and E> P in the dry subtropical descending 
branches of the Hadley cell (Fig. 9). Thc general circulation 
offsets these imbalances, with nct moisture convergence into 
the equatorial region (hence the name Intertropical Conver­
gence Zone) and net moisture divergence from the subtropics. 
Thus a significant amount of tropical precipitation does nOi 
originate from locally evaporated water. 
The existence of tropical and extratropical dynamical 
regimes (see Showman et al., this volume) on Eanh, plus the 
presence of preferred upwelling and downwelling regions 
in each, creates four basic climate or habitabilit y zones: 
(1) equatorial. characterized by weak stratification , high 
humidity, and regular though intermiUent strong precipita­
tion; (2) subtropical, with weak stratificatio n (except for 
low-level inversions) but low humidity, and therefore weak 
precipitation; (3) midlarirude , with stronger stratification and 
high humidity, and therefore regular slowly varying mod­
erate precipitation; and (4) polar, characterized by strong 
stratification and low humidity, and thus weak precipitation. 
Life exists in each of these zones, but the morc extreme 
conditions and life forms of the subtropical and polar desert 
regimes are less likely to be detected from space, The more 
abundant life that thrives in the more heavily precipitating 
equatorial and midlatitud e regimes is more likely to provide 
an exoplanet biosignature, 
A similar water cycle imbalance applies 10 different 
surface types. The oceans evaporate -10% more water than 
they precipitate , and vice versa for land (Fig. 10). Thus there 
is a net atmospheric transport of water from ocean to land, 
implying that in some regions. continental precipitation 
is provided more by remote ocean sources than by local 
evapotranspiration. Water returns to the ocean via surface 
runoff and subsurface groundwater flow. Ott Genio: Physical Proct!Sses COli/roiling &mh's Climalt! 9 
AI TOA, the energy cycle is purely radiative, as given 
by equation (I). However, at the surface and within the 
atmosphere, the energy cycle (Fig. I) and water cycle 
(Fig. 10) are directly coupled. At the surface, the turbulent 
fluxes that balance most of the absorbed sunlight (Fig. I) are

i.e., the Bowen ratio of sensible to latent heat flux is small. 
while ovcr land the ratio varies considerably according to

turbulent fluxes from the surface, mostly by the latent heat

depends not only directly on thc physical processcs that 
produce precipitation (e.g .• moist convcction), but indirectly 
on phenomena whose direct influences are only radiative 
(e.g .. the areal coverage of nonprccipitating stratocumulus

To translate this knowledge to other planets and an­
ticipatc similarities and differences, we need to understand 
why particular processes control particular aspects of the 
climate. In general, when multiple processes occur, the 
fastest process dominates, and so it is instructive to define 
characteristic time or length scales for different proccsses 
and foml appropriat e dimensionless ratios to asscss thcir 
importance.

but GeMs suggest that a slowly rotating Earth with few

To organize our thinking about the importance of moist 
processes and the combined temperature and water condi­
tions that are most conducive to supporting life. it is useful 
to define several energy and water-related timescales that 
might be relevant to assessments of habitability : 
1. The radiative time constant trad = pcpT/gF is the ratio 
of atmospheric heat content to the rate of radiative cooling 
to space F of a layer of depth one scale height. An analogous 
time constant with suitable values of Ihe heat capacilY for 
different thicknesses of fluid can be used to explain the tim­
escales on which the ocean mixed layer, thermocline, and 
deep ocean respond to radiative perturbat ions at the surface. 
2. The residence lime of waler Ires = PW/P, similarly 
defined as the ratio of the column water vapor content 
PW to Ihe precipitation rate P, measures the vigor of the 
hydrologic cycle. {HI Gtnio: Physical PrrxUStS Controllins &lnh's CUmatt 11 
3. The dynamicaltimescales for synoptic scale weather 
variability (Ids = UU), where L is a typical length scale for 
synoptic flow; for planetary scale heat transport (Idp = aIV), 
where V is a typical mean meridional wind speed; and for 
convective adjustment of the lapse rate (loon = H/W). where 
H is the scale height and W a typical convective updraft 
speed. assess the importanc e of transports by different 
dynamical mechanisms. 
4. External astronomical timescales such as the diurnal 
(I<II.y) and seasonal (tyear) timescales measure the importance 
of variations in solar/stellar forcing. 
From these time constants a variety of potentially useful 
dimensionless numbers can be constructed. For example. 
numerical weather prediction models of Eanh need not 
acknowledge the rising and setting of the Sun to predict the 
arrival of a low pressure center and rain in 24 hr because

Thus the impact of large orbital eccentricity on exoplanet

A useful measure of the role of moisl processes in a 
planet's climate might be given by the ratio tre/t....., with a 
small value being diagnostic of a vigorous hydrologic cycle

4. LESSONS FROM TERRESTRIAL 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Most readers of this book wililhink of other planets when 
they hear the term ""comparative climatology."" However, 
Earth's own history. and its projected near-term future. are 
also exercises in comparativ e climatology. These have con­
siderable relevance for issues such as the limits of the habit­
able wne for exoplanets. For in-depth analysis of specific 
climate change issues we refer the reader to the chapters in 
this volume by Covey et aJ. (greenhouse effect and feed­
backs). Zem (orbital variability effects), Harder and Woods 
(solar variability effects). and lian et al. (climate evolution). 
In this section we instead consider what we have and have 
not yetleamed about Earth in panicular. and climate change 
processes in genera), from studying past and future climates. 
The most relevant climate change topic for a planetary 
audience is the sensitivity of Earth's climate to eltternal 
forcings. The only way for the global climate 10 change 
is via an imbalance between absorbed SW radialion (Q) 
and outgoing LW radialion (F). From equation (I), this can 
only be initiated by a change in solar (or stellar) luminosity, 
changing SQ: a forced change in planetary albedo A (due to a 
volcanic eruption. aerosol emissions, deforestation. elc.): or 
a change in greenhouse gas concentrations (which changes 
the LW opacity and Ihus moves lhe emission-Io-space level 
to a different altitude, temporaril y changing TJ. For lhe pur­
pose of evaluating habitable zone limits for eltoplanels, Ihe 
samc thing is accompli shed by changing d in equation (I) 
(e.g .. Abe et al., 2011). Once a climate change is externally 
forced. inlemal feedbacks (see Covey el al .. this volume) 
further alter A and T~ as the system tries 10 equilibrate. For a 
gradual climate perturbation such as anthropogenic emission 
of greenhouse gases, the most rapid response is a cooling of 
the stratosphere, which is approximatcly in radiative equilib­
rium. followed shortly by warming of the troposphere and 
land surface (Hansell et al .. 2005). Tropopau se height and 
emission level rise, but since the troposphere has wamled, 
Tc at the new higher emission levcl is not very different from that before the onset of the c1imale change. Thus. 
as mentioned in section 2, tOOay's climate is only out of 
balance by -0.6 W/m2. The surface temperatu re warms as 
the deeper troposphere convectively adjusts on the longer 
timescales associated with the thermal inertia of the ocean 
and climate feedback s (Hallsell et a/., 1985). 
Historically an idealized ""equilibrium climate sensitiv­
ity"" has been estimated in GCMs by instantaneously dou­
bling the concentration of CO2 (""2xC02 "") in an atmospheric 
GCM coupled to a Q-ftUlt ocean. This decreases F because 
the more opaque atmosphere radiates to space from a higher 
colder altitude. causing an imbalance Q > F that causes the 
planet to warm. When the climate equilibrat es and Q = F 
once again, the resulting surface tempcmtur e change aTs 
is referred to as the equilibrium climate sensitivity. In the 
current generation of GCMs being run for the fifth Coupled 
MOOellntercompari son Project (CMIP5). a different way of 
estimating climate sensitivity is being employed that uses a 
regression based on the transient climate change of a fully 
coupled atmosphere-ocean model, which sometimes gives 
a different result. 
4_1. Is the Past Prologue? 
Unlike numerical weather prediction models, whose 
short-term weather forecasts are evaluated every day, we 
have no simple way to define observational meuies that are 
useful as indicators of the fidelity of climate change projec­
tions. Such metrics have been proposed (e.g., Reichler and 
Kim, 2008) but tend to be based on available datasets rather 
than a consideration of the factors that maner most to climate 
changc. Even TOA radiative fluxes, which arc ultimately 
the source of climate change, are useless as climate change 
metrics when only their current climate mean state is uti­
lized (Pincus et 01., 2008: Collins et al .. 20 II; Klocke el al .. 
2011). Most previous studies have used .ftatic metrics such 
as monthly geographical distributions of climate parameters. 
as opposed to IJrocess-based melric.f. which measure how 
some important aspect of the climate changes with time or 
as a function of some independ ent controlling parameter. 
One possible way to constrain climate sensitivity is to 
use the changes that have occurred in Earth's past. Eanh has 
experienced multiple cold (glacial) and warm (interglacial) 
periods in its history, which in principle can provide useful 
infonnation . Some of the more dmmatic possible climate 
changes occurred in the distant past. e.g .. the hypothesi7..ed 
(and debated) snowball Earth episodes of the Neoproterozoic 
Era (1000-542 Ma) (Soli I and Cllandler, 2007: Abbot et al .. 
2012), which are relevant to the issue of the outer edge ofthc 
habitable zone. The paleoclimatic evidence for such distant 
epochs. however, is sparse. More recent periods such as 
the mid-Holocene (6 ka) are bellcr document ed but involve 
small «I°e) climate changes that make them less useful 
for insights into the future (Hargreaves and Alillall, 2(X)9). 
The epoch with the best combination of extensive docu­
mentation and a large magnitude of climate change is the 
Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (21 ka). It has often been lkl Gr""iQ; Physicul Proctssrs CQ""uolti""s Earrh""s Cfimlllr 13 
assumed that the LGM. and earlier glacials and interglacials 
associated with the Milankovitch cycles of orbital variations 
(see Zent. this volume), can be used to infer the sensitivity 
of a future warmed climate. One problem with this as­
sumption is that the LGM climate is less welJ known than 
is needed to provide a simple constraint. Early attempts to 
simulate the LGM with GCMs used prescribed sea surface 
temperature (SSn anomalies derived from ocean proxies by 
the CLIMAP Project (see Rind. 2008). The CLlMAP SSTs 
had some unusual features. such as a mid-Pacific wamling 
signal and only a small tropical ocean cooling signal of 
_1.5°C. despite woe cooling at high latitudes and sig­
nificant cooling based on different proxies in tropical land 
areas. These results implied a fairly low climate sensitivity. 
and multiple GCMs could not reproduce them. More recent 
LGM reconstructions (Waelbroeck el 01 .. 2(X)9) have used 
multiple proxies instead, finding larger tropical cooling 
that implies a higher climate sensitivity. Today's GCMs 
do not use the proxy data directly but rather run coupled 
atmosphere-ocean models and use the reconstructions 
for evaluation. Nonetheless. some glaring inconsistencies 
between the models and the data remain. calling the inter­
pretation of the prolties into question (Brady el al .. 2013). 
The second problem with the LGM as a proxy for fu­
ture climate sensitivity is that GCMs provide conflicting 
results. Crucifix (2006) found that four GCMs that spanned 
almost the full range of 6Ts uncertainty for a doubling of 
COl concentration also simulated almost identical climate 
sensitivities to each other in response to LGM climate forc­
ings (Fig. 12). The discrepancies were mainly allribl.lled to 
cloud feedbacks that changed sign between the colder and 
warmer climates in some of the models. This should not be 
a surprise given the nonlinearity of the climate system. Ye 
el al. (1998). for example. showed that convective available 
potential energy. which affects moist convection, varies dif­
ferently in response to +2 and --:zoC SST changes. because 
in the wanner climate. the current balance between con­
vective heating and radiative COOling just intensifies, while 
in the cooler climate, convection decreases dramatically, 
yielding to the large-scale dynamic s as the process that 
balances radiative cooling to first order. Hargreaves et al. 
(2012) have suggested that LGM tropical cooling is a good 
indicator of equilibrium climate sensitivity based on a larger 
ensemble of GCMs. but this test has not yel been applied 
to future climate change predictions, and inferences drawn 
from it are still subject to uncenainties in the interpretati on 
of the observational proxies. 
The message is nOI Ihat past climates are useless as con­
straints on future climate_ but rather that cont.inued thought 
must be given to how we can best use what we know about 
them to differentiate responses that are robust to the type 
of climate change examined from those that arc sensitive 
to different types of climate change or to uncertainties in 
the observations themselves. Schmidt el al. (2013) propose 
several useful strategies for doing this. 
The most commonly used ""metric"" of the past for 
demonstraling the realism of climate models is the global 14 Compamriw I ClinUlloiogy ofTerrtSlri al Planl'IS 
warming that has occurred over the twentieth century. Older 
generations of climate GeMs generally matched the twen­
tieth century warming quite well. However. Kiehl (2007) 
showed that they did this despite a wide variety of climate 
forcings and climate sensitivities (within the observational 
uncertainties) because the forcings and sensitivi ties were 
negatively correlated. For example, a model with more 
aerosol cooling might also havc a highcr sensitivity to CO2, 
The current CMIP5 generation of models does not show this 
behavior (Forster el al., 2013) (Fig. 13), although a subset 
of the models that agrees best with the observed temperature 
trend does, perhaps because most current models now try to 
include the very uncertain aerosol indirect effect on clouds. 
This causes some models to depart from the observed trend 
to an extent not seen in older models. Observations arc 
not yet good enough to tell us the correct combination of 
forcing and feedback. hence we cannot use the twentieth 
century temperature record to ""validate"" climate models. On 
the other hand. no GCM with only natural climate forcings 
has ever been able to reproduce the observed warming: this 
is perhaps the best evidence we have that the warming of 
recent decades is due to anthropogenic influences (Knutli, 
2008). In this sense today's climate models are ""wrong but 
useful"" (Schmidt. 2009). 
A caveat to the statements above is the chaotic nature 
of the climate system. Weather forecasts are sensitive to

unresolved processes such as moist convection and thus 
must be considered probabili stic (Slillgo alld Palmer. 20 II). 
One can then ask 10 what extent long-term climate change 
is predictable. Loren? (1968) considered a possible ""almost 
intransitive"" climate system whose statistics were insensi­
live to initial condilions on infinite timescales but sensitive 
to initial conditions over long but finite time intervals. 
Hasselmllllll (1976) showed how shon-term weather aCIS 
as a stochastic forcing whose effect is integrated by slow 
components of the climate system (e.g .. the upper oce:m) 
to produce longer timescale variations in sea surface tem­
peratures. The twentieth century climate appears to have 
unforced decadal variations. perhaps due to episodes of deep 
ocean heat storage (and littlc surface wamling) aliemating 
with episodes of greater near-surface warming . To date. 
however. ensemble climate model integration s over many 
centuries do nOi exhibit the longer-term, larger-amplitude 
natural variability required for the twentieth century to be 
explained as the behavior of an almost intransitive system. 
Uncertainty in future climate projection s is dominated in­
stead by uncertainty in model physics (Sliligo ami Palmer. 
20 II). as we discuss next. 
4.2. How Well Can We Project Future 
Climate Warming? 
Climate GCMs have been used to project future climate 
change for four decades. but the uncenainty in the 2C02 
aTs has not changed much. A doubling of CO2 concentra­
tion by itself wanns the surface temperature by _1.2°C. yet 
for much of the history of climate modeling, the 2xC02 
aT, of different climate models has ranged from _1.5° to 
4.5°C. The reason for the difference is fcedbacks that either 
amplify (positive feedback) or mitigate (negative feedback) 
the original CO2-forced climate change (see Covey et al.. 
this volume. for a detailed discussion). Briefly, the primary 
feedback s and their sign are the Planck feedback due to 
increased emission to space from a warmer atmosphere 
(negalive): the water vapor feedback due to the greenhouse 
effect of the waler vapor added by evaporatio n from a 
warmer surface (positive): the lapse rate feedback due pri­
marily to the lemperature dependence of the moist adiabmic 
lapse rate, which increases warming at altitude at the ex­
pense of that at the surface (negative): the snow/ice-albedo 
feedback from the decrease in planetary albedo caused by 
melting snow and sea ice as climate warms (positive); and 
the cloud feedback due to changes in cloud cover, height. 
and optical thickness. 
QUllntitative differencc-'i exist among models in the Planck, 
water vapor. lapse rate. and snow/ice-albedo feedbacks 
(Fig. 14). but their sign is not in doubt. Most of the spread 
in aT, comes from uncertainty in the sign and magnitude 
of the cloud feedback. II is often claimed that as climate 
warms, more water evaporates from the oceans, making 
more cloud. which reflects more sunlight. a negative feed­
back. BUI clouds do not depend on the mixing ralio of water vapor (which changes dramatically with temperatur e, given 
the Clausius-Clapeyro n equation) but rather the relative 
humidity (the mixing ratio relative to its saturation value), 
static stability, and other environmental factors. which do 
not obviously vary with warming in a direction that would 
either increase or decrease cloud. Furthermore , clouds at dif­
ferent altitudes have radiative effects of opposite sign. Low 
stratocumulus clouds. which reflect considerable sunlight 
but have little effect on outgoing LW radiation (Fig. 3), 
cool the planet. so increasing/decreasing them would be 
a negative/positive feedback. Cirrus clouds. on the other 
hand. are thinner and reflect less sunlight. but lie above 
the clear sky emission to space level and thus reduce LW 
emission to space, so increasing/decreasi ng them would be 
a positive/negative feedback. Changes in cloud height and 
optical thickness contribute to the cloud feedback as well, 
more so for some cloud types in some places than others. 
This makes representin g cloud effects in one-dimensional 
models of exoplanet habitable zones (Kitzman et ai., 2010; 
Zsom et aJ., 2012) a tremendous challenge. 
For the CMlP3 generation of climate models, cloud feed­
back as evaluated by the climate change in cloud forcing 
varied from negative to near-neutral to jXlsitive. according to 
Soden et aJ. (2008) (Fig. 14). consistent with the canonical 
wisdom that we do not know the sign of cloud feedback. 
Soden and Heid (2006), however. note that the cloud forc­
ing method of calculating feedback is biased because the 
cloud effect on mdiation is differenced against the clear sky 
mdiative fluxes, which also change as the climate changes. 
By calculating ""radiative kemels"" that represent the partial 
derivatives of TO A fluxes with respect to different feedback

parameters , they derive an adjusted cloud forcing change 
that is a more accurate depiction of the cloud feedback. 
Determined in this way, all the CMIP3 models have either 
a ncar-neutral or positive cloud feedback (Fig. 14), the op­
posite of the canonical wisdom. FurthemlOre, the range of 
CMIP3 climate sensitivities is 2.lc--4.4°C, i.e., the lowest 
sensitivities are no longer being simulated by any model. 
Early indications from the current eMIP5 GeMs are 
that the situation has not changed dmmatically, but now the 
sources of the net positive cloud feedback are being under­
stood (Zelinka et ai .. 2013): a positive LW cloud feedback 
due to an upward shift in the altitude of high clouds. and a 
jXlsitive SW feedback due to a decrease in total cloudiness 
outside the polar regions. The former is a robust consequence 
of the deepening of convection as the surface warms. The 
latter is a combination of two effects: a poleward shift of 
the stonn tracks as the Hadley cell expands, also a robust 
result, and a decrease in low-latitude stratocumulu s and shal­
low cumulus cloud cover, which may be understood (Brient 
and Bony, 2012) but is not thought to be reliably simulated 
by GeMs with coarse vertical resolution. At high latitudes, 
cloud optical thickness tends to increase with warming, a 
negative feedback. The response of climate model clouds to 
warming can be summarized as an ""upward and outward"" 
shift of clouds from the tropical lower troposphere to higher

with ""structural"" differences (resolution, parameterization 
approaches) but that do not represent the full range of 
feedback uncertainty . A different approach is the ""perturbed 
parameter ensemble,"" a set of thousands of simulation s us­
ing a single climate model but with free parameters altercd 
from onc simulation 10 the next over the range of their 
uncertainty . This produces a probability density function 
of climate sensitivity whose 5-95% range of probability is 
not very different from that of the ensemble of opportunity 
except for some probabili ty of climate sensitivities much 
greater than any ever simulated by an operational model 
(Stainforlh et al .. 2005). With the perturbed parameter ap­
proach one can identify which parameters have the greatest 
effect on the model's sensitivity. Analysis of this ensemble 
suggests that .6.Ts (in the context of one particular GeM) is 
most sensitive to assumptions about the rate of entrainment 
of dry air into convective updrafts, the fall speed of ice 
crystals, and paramete rs that affect the formation of clouds 
and precipitation (Sanderson el al.. 2010). 
The climate sensitivities simulated by today's GeMs 
incorporate only ""fast"" feedback s due to atmospheric 
or near-surface processes. On longer timescales. ""slow"" 
feedbacks due 10 continental ice sheet growth and retreat, 
vegetation changes, and carbon fluxes into and out of the 
atmosphere, soil, biosphere, and ocean can produce an 
""Earth system sensitivity"" quite different from the climate 
sensitivity due to fast feedbacks. Estimates of this sensitiv­
ity suggest that it could be 50-100% larger than the _3°e 
median fast feedback sensitivity (Lulll el al., 2010; Park 
and Royer. 2011). Furthermore, even for the fast feedbacks. 
climate sensitivity is expected to depend on atmospheric 
state. Thus it may vary from that portrayed by the CMIP5 
models when larger climate excursions are considered and 
thresholds for qualitatively different behaviors of climate 
system components are crossed (Hansen el al .. 2013). 
The apparent preponderance of positive feedbacks in the 
Earth system thus makes continued future warming highly 
probable. Furthermore, with the caveat that exoplanet sci­
ence considers variations much larger and nonlinear than 
those discussed here, what we know about Earth also may 
have implications for assessmen ts of the habitable zone of 
Earth-like planets: 
I. Ocean heat transport, which retards the sea ice growth 
(Fig. 7) and tropicaVpolar heating imbalance that helps 
determine habitable zone limits, but which is missing from 
most exoplanet mooels (e.g., Abe el al. 2011), may broaden 
the habitable zone. 
2. The negative net cloud forcing of Earth's climate 
(Fig. 3) may shift the habitable zone inward relative to 
estimates that use a cloud-free atmosphere (KopparaplI el 
al., 2013). 
3. The likelihood that many fast and slow feedbacks 
on Earth are positive offsets some part of the ocean-and 
cloud-forcing impacts. and would shrink the habitable zone. 5. CONCLUS IONS 
Much remains to be beuer understood about Eanh's cli· 
mate: how convection interacts with the general circulation 
in different dynamic and thermooynami c environments; how 
aerosols, radialion, and clouds interact with turbulence to 
determine the presence or absence of marine stratocumul us 
clouds; how stratospheric circulations affect the troposphere; 
how stable continental ice sheets are to penurbations; and so 
on. Even when we understand the basic physics. we are not 
yet able to always ponray it properly in GeMs that do not 
resolve the processes, and this limits our predictive ability. 
Nonetheless, our accumulated knowledge about Earth can 
serve as a valuable resource for solar system and exoplanet 
atmospheric scientists. For exoplanets. inferences are limited 
by our inability to resolve spatial details of observed plan­
ets. Thus. one might observe Eanh remotely as if it were 
an exoplanet (Kam/idi et al .. 2012), not to learn anything 
new about Earth, but to use our detailed knowledge of its 
spatially varying radiative properties to understand how best 
to interpret a disk-integrated exoplanet spectrum. Likewise, 
a chronic sampling problem plagues solar system science 
because missions visit specific planets only occasionally 
and often do not monitor them globally and continuously. Is 
the composition and thermodynami c structure observed by 
a single planetary probe typical of the global mean? Do dif­
ferences between snapshots of a planet taken by a past flyby 
and a current orbiter indicate a climate change or random 
samples of natural variability? Our sparse observatio ns of 
other planets might be placed into an appropriate context by 
sampling Earth satellite datasets or reanalyses in a similar 
way and asking how representative those samples are of 
conditions elsewhere or al other limes. 
More importantly. our understanding of the mechanisms 
that conspire to produce Earth's weather and climate should 
probably be used as the starting point for trying to interpret 
any new observation of another planet. Often Earth is a 
valuable guide to the physics operating on other terrestrial 
planets: baroclinic waves on Mars, deep moist convection 
on Titan, photochemica l sulfuric acid aerosols on Venus. 
When this is not the case, asking why not brings deeper 
insights than considering either planet in isolation. The 
same applies in the opposite direction: The terrestrial at­
mospheric community would benefit greatly from thinking 
more often about other planets and testing the depth of their 
understanding by bringing it to a different part of parameter 
space. Such a planetary perspective on our own planet will 
help us identify the fundamental unanswered questions that 
will advance the science the furthest.
