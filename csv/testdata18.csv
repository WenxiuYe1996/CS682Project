Abstract. We examine the climate effects of the emissions
of near-term climate forcers (NTCFs) from 4 continental re-gions (East Asia, Europe, North America and South Asia)using results from the Task Force on Hemispheric Transportof Air Pollution Source-Receptor global chemical transport
model simulations. We address 3 aerosol species (sulphate,particulate organic matter and black carbon) and 4 ozone
precursors (methane, reactive nitrogen oxides (NO
x), volatile
organic compounds and carbon monoxide). We calculate theglobal climate metrics: global warming potentials (GWPs)and global temperature change potentials (GTPs). For theaerosols these metrics are simply time-dependent scalings ofthe equilibrium radiative forcings. The GTPs decrease morerapidly with time than the GWPs. The aerosol forcings andhence climate metrics have only a modest dependence onemission region. The metrics for ozone precursors includethe effects on the methane lifetime. The impacts via methaneare particularly important for the 20 yr GTPs. Emissions ofNO
xand VOCs from South Asia have GWPs and GTPs of
higher magnitude than from the other Northern Hemisphereregions.
The analysis is further extended by examining the
temperature-change impacts in 4 latitude bands, and cal-culating absolute regional temperature-change potentials(ARTPs). The latitudinal pattern of the temperature responsedoes not directly follow the pattern of the diagnosed radia-
tive forcing. We ﬁnd that temperatures in the Arctic latitudesappear to be particularly sensitive to BC emissions fromSouth Asia. The northern mid-latitude temperature response
to northern mid-latitude emissions is approximately twice aslarge as the global average response for aerosol emission, andabout 20–30 % larger than the global average for methane,
VOC and CO emissions.
1 Introduction
The emissions of reactive gases and aerosols can inﬂuence
human and ecosystem health by affecting ozone and par-ticulate matter concentrations (HTAP, 2010). They can also
affect climate through the burdens of ozone, methane and
aerosols, having both cooling and warming effects. Becauseof the short lifetimes of aerosols (days), ozone (weeks),methane (a decade), and their precursors, their climate ef-fects are predominantly in the near term (less than 30 yr)
so we refer to these species as “near-term climate forcers
(NTCFs)”. They are also often called short-lived climate pol-lutants (SLCPs).
UNEP and WMO (2011) and Shindell et al. (2012) have
suggested that the mitigation of ozone precursors and black

carbon (BC) would be attractive for both air quality and cli-
mate on a 30-yr timescale, provided it is not at the expenseof CO
2mitigation. Typical air quality policies target both
warming and cooling species and tend to have an overalldetrimental effect on climate (in terms of surface tempera-tures). Therefore, it is important to understand how the ef-fects of NTCFs vary by location of emissions, when air qual-ity policies are considered. This can also be important forclimate policies that affect both short and long-lived species(Berntsen et al., 2006). Many metrics have been proposed tocompare these effects on climate, but here we consider theintegrated radiative forcing (RF) using the global warmingpotential metric (GWP) (IPCC, 1990) and the surface tem-perature change using the global and regional temperature-change metrics (GTP and RTP) (Shine et al., 2005; Shindelland Faluvegi, 2010).
The NTCFs we consider in this paper are sulphate, par-
ticulate organic matter (POM), black carbon (BC), methaneand ozone precursors. Some halogenated species have shortlifetimes and are therefore NTCFs, but we do not consider
those here. NTCFs with lifetimes longer than the interhemi-
spheric mixing time (such as methane) are considered rea-sonably well mixed, with the concentrations and RF patternsindependent of the emission location. Species with shorterlifetimes such as ozone and aerosols have heterogeneous dis-tributions and RF patterns that are dependent on the emis-
sion location (Fuglestvedt et al., 1999; Berntsen et al., 2005;
Naik et al., 2005; Fry et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2013). The sur-face temperature response does not directly follow the spatialdetails of the RF pattern, rather it smoothes out the patternover scales of ˜3500 km in the meridional direction and over12000 km in the zonal direction (Shindell et al., 2010).
The RFs and GWPs for the Task Force on Hemispheric
Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP) Source-Receptor globalchemical transport model (CTM) simulations (HTAP, 2010)were previously documented by Fry et al. (2012) for reac-tive gases, and by Yu et al. (2013) for aerosols. In this studywe have moved further down the chain of climate impacts,
showing how analytical formulae can be used to relate equi-
librium RF values to the evolution of global and latitudinaltemperature changes.
We use the HTAP RF estimates to calculate GWPs in
Sect. 3.1. From these, we derive the global mean surface tem-perature responses as functions of time for emissions of dif-ferent components in different Northern Hemisphere regions,and normalise by the corresponding response for CO
2to de-
rive GTPs in Sect. 3.2. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 follow a similar,but not identical methodology to Fuglestvedt et al. (2010).One difference being that for the ozone precursor reduction
cases, we use experiments with ﬁxed global methane con-
centrations; our calculations are based on RF and changesin methane lifetimes rather than the steady-state atmosphericconcentrations and primary mode time constant that wereused in Fuglestvedt et al. (2010). Then in Sect. 4, we gobeyond looking at global mean values for the response anduse the recently introduced concept of the RTP (Shindell and
Faluvegi, 2010; Shindell et al., 2012) to quantify the impactsof regional pollutant emissions on temperatures in broad lat-
itude bands.
2 Methodology
The basic data needed as input to the GWP and GTP cal-
culations can be derived from the equilibrium RF responsesof chemistry transport models to step changes in emis-sions. Here we use results from the HTAP study (HTAP,2010) in which an ensemble of chemistry transport mod-
els carried out experiments reducing the emissions of (an-thropogenic) ozone or aerosol precursors by 20 % in four
Northern Hemisphere continental regions (North America[NA, 15
◦–55◦N, 60◦W–125◦W], Europe [EU, 25◦–65◦N,
10◦W–50◦E], East Asia [EA, 15◦–50◦N, 95◦–160◦E], and
South Asia [SA, 5◦–35◦N, 50◦–95◦E]). Each ozone precur-
sor was reduced separately in each region. For the aerosolexperiments, all species were reduced together. The effectsof regional ozone precursor emission changes (NO
x, CO,
NMVOCs, methane) on ozone and methane concentrationswere calculated by Fiore et al. (2009). The consequent netRF impacts from an ensemble of 11 of the CTMs were cal-culated by Fry et al. (2012). The changes in RF due to theemissions of SO
2, primary particulate organic matter (POM)
and BC were calculated by Yu et al. (2013) from an ensembleof 9 models.
Because of the time needed for methane to equilibrate to
emissions changes, methane concentrations were ﬁxed glob-ally to 1760 ppb (nmol mol
−1) for all experiments except for
the methane perturbation experiment in which it was reducedby 20 % to 1408 ppb. The impacts of ozone precursor emis-sions on global methane and long-term ozone responses werecalculated analytically from the methane loss by troposphericOH diagnostic reported by each CTM (Fiore et al., 2009; Fryet al., 2012).
Fry et al. (2012) used the NOAA Geophysical Fluid
Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) standalone radiative trans-fer model (GFDL GAMDT, 2004) to calculate the grid-ded, stratospheric-adjusted net radiative ﬂuxes (incoming
shortwave minus outgoing longwave) at steady state due to
changes in methane, ozone, and sulphate aerosol. The 3-Dconcentration ﬁelds were from the multi-model mean alongwith the mean ±1 standard deviation. The radiative transfer
model simulations exclude aerosol-cloud interactions and theinternal mixing of aerosols.
Yu et al. (2013) applied normalised direct RFs (NDRFs)
calculated with the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiationand Transport (GOCART) model (Yu et al., 2004) to theaerosol optical depths (AODs) from each model. The NDRFswere applied on a 2
◦×2.5◦degree grid for each month of
the year for each of the three components (SO 4, POM, BC).
No aerosol-cloud interactions were included and the aerosols

tion of one did not affect the RF of another.

3 Global metrics
3.1 Global warming potentialsGWPs have been the most common way to compare the
relative climate effects of different species. The absoluteglobal warming potential (AGWP) is deﬁned (IPCC, 1990)as the integrated RF over a time horizon Hdue to a 1 kg
pulse emission of a species and has units Wm
−2yr kg−1.

where Ais the speciﬁc
RF (RF per kg atmospheric burden). AGWP is typically nor-
malised by the AGWP for CO 2to give a dimensionless quan-
tity GWP. Here we use the CO 2impulse response function
from the IPCC AR4 (Forster et al., 2007) where the RF from
a pulse of CO 2is given by ACO2/parenleftBigg

ACO2is the radiative efﬁciency for CO 2in Wm−2kg−1
(1.82×10−15Wm−2kg−1),a0−3are unit less coefﬁcients
[0.217, 0.259, 0.338 and 0.186], and αCO2
1−3are CO 2response
timescales [172.9, 18.51, 1.186] years. This gives AGWPsfor CO
2of 2.5 ×10−14and 8.7 ×10−14Wm−2yr kg−1at
time horizons of 20 and 100 yr respectively.
3.1.1 Aerosols
For the aerosol species, the lifetimes are sufﬁciently short
that the atmospheric burdens rapidly reach equilibrium aftera step change in emission. The equilibrium RFs, Fper emis-
sion change Efor each species ( F/E)(e.g. Table 6 of Yu
et al. (2013)), are equal to Aα. Hence, provided that the time
horizon chosen is much longer than the lifetime of the aerosol
(α/lessmuchH), the AGWP is also simply equal to the equilibrium
response to a unit step change in emissions and is indepen-dent of the time horizon. A similar argument was made byBond et al. (2011) where they introduced the speciﬁc forcingpulse (SFP) (units J kg
−1). For short-lived species ( α/lessmuchH)
the global SFP is simply a scaling of the AGWP. We do not
use the SFP concept further in this paper, but it is useful to
illustrate that for short-lived species the AGWP can be con-sidered an effectively instantaneous energy perturbation tothe system.
The AGWP is a measure of the globally-averaged net ra-
diative effect of an emission pulse, but the emissions them-
selves do not need to be globally emitted. Emissions fromdifferent regions have different lifetimes and the speciﬁc RFsmay be regionally dependent. Both of these lead to a depen-dence of AGWP on the emitting region. AGWPs for SO
2,
POM and BC are listed for the 4 HTAP regions in Table 1;
these are the same values as listed in Yu et al. (2013) Ta-
ble 6 with a change of units. AGWPs for SO 2and POM
are negative reﬂecting the cooling impact. The values forEA are slightly smaller than for the other continents due tomore rapid removal of the aerosols and lower oxidation efﬁ-ciency (Koch et al., 2007). Pollutants are typically exportedfrom EA by frontal systems with associated strong precipita-tion (HTAP, 2010). In contrast, BC emissions have positiveAGWPs, and the values for EU are slightly larger than forthe other continents as these absorbing aerosols are advectedover the brighter surfaces of the Arctic. The GWP values canbe derived by normalising by the AGWP
CO2(see above), giv-
ing GWP(100)s of −40±9,−46±20, and 340 ±210 for
SO2, POM and BC, respectively for emissions from “All”
regions. These are of slightly lower magnitude than in Fu-glestvedt et al. (2010), but within the uncertainty ranges.
3.1.2 Methane
The decay time for a methane perturbation is around 12 yr,
hence for time horizons of 20 or 30 yr, the criterion ( α/lessmuchH)
no longer holds. For methane, the HTAP experiments werebased on a global change in the methane concentration
www.atmos-chem-phys.net/13/2471/2013/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 13, 2471–2485, 20132474 W. J. Collins et al.: Temperature-change potentials for near-term climate forcers
rather than regional emission changes to save running the
chemistry models to equilibrium. Here the direct AGWP is
again given byFCH4
CH4
ECH4(1−exp(−H/slashbig

CH4is
the methane forcing diagnosed from the methane changeexperiment using the formula from Table 3 of Myhre etal. (1998). The factor faccounts for the effect of methane
on its own lifetime (Prather et al., 1996). The impliedemissions necessary to cause this change in concentra-
tion are given by E
CH4=/Delta1BCH4/fαCH4where /Delta1BCH4is
the change in methane burden. In the HTAP methane per-turbation experiment (SR2) where methane was decreasedby 20 % from 1760 ppb to 1408 ppb, /Delta1B
CH4= 979 Tg,
αCH4= 8.7±1.3 yr, f= 1.34 ±0.05 (Fiore et al., 2009) giv-
ing an implied emission of −84 Tg yr−1. Methane is an
ozone precursor, it affects the oxidation rate of SO 2to sul-
phate aerosol, and it generates water vapour (only impor-tant in the stratosphere). The two indirect forcings due to
changes in ozone FO3

et al. (2012); we also assume a stratospheric water vapour

forcing (Forster et al., 2007) giving a total indirect contribu-tion of 34 ±10 %. Contributions from ozone changes above

3.1.3 Ozone precursors
Ozone precursors (CO, VOCs and NO x) have a short-term
impact on RF by generating ozone and perturbing sulphateoxidation; they also have a longer-term impact by chang-ing the methane lifetime. The short-term impacts on ozone

iand sulphate FSO4
iforcing are diagnosed from the equi-
librium experiments perturbing emissions of species ibut
holding methane ﬁxed. For H /greatermuchα, as for the aerosols, the
AGWPs for the short-lived components are then simply
(FO3
i+FSO4
i)/Ei. Although methane concentrations were
ﬁxed in these experiments, the longer-term impacts onmethane can be diagnosed from the change in the ﬂuxesthrough the CH
4+OH reaction in the models. Changes in
methane lifetime /Delta1αCH4
iare then calculated from the ﬂux di-
agnostics. If the methane concentrations had not been ﬁxedthe methane burden would have responded to the changesin lifetime moving towards a new equilibrium burden of/parenleftBig

methane emissions has already been derived (AGWPCH4),

includes the long-term ozone and sulphate responses. Noteonly the long-term components are functions of the timehorizon. The GWPs at 20 and 100 yr for the ozone precur-
sors were presented by Fry et al. (2012), their Table S2.
3.2 Global temperature-change potentials
The GTP metric (Shine et al., 2005) is more closely re-
lated to observable climate impacts than the GWP, as it iscalculated from temperature changes. The absolute globaltemperature-change potential (AGTP) is given by the surfacetemperature response following an instantaneous pulse emis-sion. The global surface temperature responds to changes in
the RF at the tropopause on a spectrum of timescales. We
follow the same methodology in Fuglestvedt et al. (2010)and use a temperature response function that is the sum of
two exponentials R(t)=

where the coefﬁ-
cients cjanddjare the climate sensitivities and timescales

we use c 1= 0.631 K(Wm−2)−1), c 2= 0.429 K(Wm−2)−1),
d1= 8.4 yr, d 2= 409.5 yr, giving an equilibrium climate sensi-
tivity of 1.060 K(Wm−2)−1) (3.9 K for CO 2doubling). The
GTPs are constructed by normalising by the correspondingAGTP for CO
2. For this we use the expression in Fuglestvedt
et al. (2010) (their Eq. A3).

3.2.1 Aerosols
For aerosols with lifetimes much less than the time horizons
of interest and the shortest climate timescale ( α/lessmuchH,α/lessmuchd1)
the AGTP is simply a scaling of the temperature responsefunction by the equilibrium forcing from a unit step change

Table 2. GTPs at 20 and 100 yr time horizons for the HTAP aerosols (or precursors), methane and non-methane ozone precursors. Data are
given for emissions from the 4 HTAP continents separately and combined. For methane only a global number is given. Uncertainties are inter-model differences in the CTM responses to emission perturbations from Yu et al. (2013) and Fry et al. (2012). This includes uncertainties inthe aerosol and ozone responses, and in the methane lifetime response. Note these values exclude the effects of aerosol cloud interactions,the effect of BC deposition on snow albedo, changes in ozone above the tropopause and carbon-cycle interactions as described in Sect. 5.

GTPs for the 3 HTAP aerosol species from each of the 4

are listed in Table 2. The patterns are also the same as for the
AGWPs in Table 1 and the forcing efﬁciencies in Table 6 ofYu et al. (2013).
3.2.2 Methane
For methane, the interactions between the methane lifetime
and the climate response timescales become important. Com-bining the expression for the methane AGWP with equationA4 from Fuglestvedt et al. (2010) we get for the total AGTP:

The GTPCH4for 20 and 100 yr are shown in Fig. 2 and are
listed in Table 2. The decrease in GTP between 20 and 100 yris a factor of 15, much larger than for the aerosols, This is be-cause the AGTP
CH4has not dropped off as quickly by year20 as it did for the aerosols. The dominant contribution to the
GTPCH4uncertainty comes from the inter-model variability
in the methane lifetime in the control run ( αCH4). The di-
rect methane contribution to the GTP(20) and GTP(100) arein agreement with Boucher et al. (2009), however the ozonecontribution is slightly lower here as discussed in Sect. 5.1.
3.2.3 Ozone precursors
The AGTPs for the other ozone precursor species can be cal-
culated by combining the equilibrium responses with the ef-
fects on the methane lifetime to obtain an analogous expres-
sion to the AGWP:
AGTPi(H)=1
Ei/parenleftBig

R(H) +χiAGTPCH4(H) (5)
The time evolution of the total AGTPs therefore depends on
the relative balance between the short and long-term compo-nents, i.e. the almost instantaneous change in ozone and thedecadal timescale for changes in methane. Figure 3 showsthe GTP for NO
x, NMVOC and CO emissions (summed over
the 4 continents). For NO xemissions the long-term compo-
nent acts in the opposite sense to the short-term because NO x
emissions produce ozone, but decrease methane ( χiis neg-

For NMVOC and CO emissions the short-term andlong-term components have the same sign (as they increaseboth ozone and methane), with the long-term component be-ing relatively more important for CO. In all cases, the GTPis dominated by the long-term component from about 30 yr

are of similar magnitudes, although both are very small. Theresults of this can be seen in the bar charts of Fig. 4 and val-ues listed in Table 2 which break the GTPs down by emissionspecies and emission region. The net NO
xGTPs are negative
with the largest impact coming from emissions in SA, andthe least impact from EU. For VOCs the largest impact is alsofrom SA. The tropics are the region of greatest methane oxi-dation, so NO
xand VOC emissions from SA have the largest
impact on methane. CO has a sufﬁciently long lifetime that
it can be advected away from the source continent; hence,the climate impact is largely independent of emission region.The fractional contribution to the GTP from the methane re-sponse is greater for the 20 yr time horizon than the 100 yrhorizon. Although counterintuitive, the short-term contribu-tions have already fallen rapidly by the 20 yr horizon andthe curves (Fig. 3) begin to ﬂatten (decreases of a factor of7 between 20 and 100 yr), whereas for the long-term con-tributions (driven by methane changes) the 20 yr horizon isroughly in the steepest portion of the curve, declining there-after by a factor of 15 by the 100 yr horizon.

4 Regional climate change
Shindell and Faluvegi (2009), Shindell and Faluvegi (2010)
and Shindell (2012) introduced the idea of the absolute re-gional temperature-change potential (ARTP) to quantify re-gional climate change from heterogeneous forcing patterns.There is not a one-to-one correspondence between the forc-ing in a region and the local temperature response, as thereare RF contributions from outside the regions due to thetransport of heat. Shindell and Faluvegi (2009) showed thatthe forcing-temperature relationship could be characterisedusing 4 broad latitude bands: southern mid-high latitudes(90
◦S–28◦S), tropics (28◦S–28◦N), northern mid-latitudes
(28◦N–60◦N), and the Arctic (60◦N–90◦N). Thus the ex-
pression for the AGTP can be generalised as:

theklmappropriate for the species except for responses to
forcing in the 28◦S–90◦S band which was only derived for
CO2by Shindell and Faluvegi (2009). The coefﬁcients used
for BC and O 3are taken from Table 3, normalising by the
climate sensitivity. We assume that the temperature responsefunction Rapplies equally to temperature changes in each
region. As discussed in Shindell and Faluvegi (2010), in thedifferent latitude bands encompassing such diverse regions
as the Arctic and the tropics, the partitioning between the
fast and slow responses and even the time constants of theseresponses may vary from the global average. There is no datacurrently available to break this down further, although Shin-dell (2012) suggests that the land response might be 20 %
larger than the average of land and ocean.
4.1 Aerosols
For aerosol emissions, the ARTPs have the same functional
form as the AGTPs with the magnitudes given by the prod-uct of the response coefﬁcients with the forcing pattern. Thetemperature change in latitude band mdue to the emission ofspecies i:

where Fiis the equilibrium globally-average forcing as be-

itudinal patterns of the ARTPs for aerosols do not vary withtime. Figure 5 shows the normalised equilibrium forcing pat-terns ( F
i,l/Ei) and the ARTPi
m(20) values for the 3 aerosol
species. Note that for the scattering aerosols (SO 2and POM
emissions) the largest RF is in the latitude band closest to theemitting region (28
◦N–60◦N for EA, EU and NA emissions,
28◦S–28◦N for SA emissions). There seems to be very lit-
tle RF from scattering aerosols over the bright Arctic lati-
tudes as there is less contrast between the brightness of theaerosol and the underlying albedo. For the absorbing aerosol(BC), due to the high contrast, the RF is high over the Arc-tic latitudes, and for EU emissions the Arctic RF exceedsthat of the northern mid-latitudes. Applying the matrix of re-
sponse coefﬁcients smoothes out the impacts such that there
is less latitudinal variation in the temperature responses thanin the RFs. The Arctic temperatures are particularly sensitiveto forcing changes in the northern mid-latitudes (at least inthe coefﬁcient set used here), where the Arctic responses tothe scattering aerosols are comparable to the northern mid-
latitude responses.
For BC the Arctic shows a lower surface temperature re-
sponse than would be expected from the RF pattern. This isbecause for BC the k
lmare negative for the Arctic response
to Arctic forcing (see Table 3), i.e. a positive RF over theArctic due to changes in atmospheric BC has a cooling ef-fect on Arctic temperatures (ﬁgure 1d of Shindell and Falu-vegi 2009). This relationship, while surprising, has been con-ﬁrmed by other studies (Sand et al., 2013; Flanner, 2013) andis caused primarily by a decrease in the meridional heat trans-port. The Arctic cooling effect only applies to BC changes
in the mid to upper Arctic troposphere, such as found here
following advection from northern mid-latitude and tropicalsources. Local Arctic emission of BC has a warming effect,as does deposition of BC on to Arctic snow from any sourceregion (Flanner, 2013). The net effect on the Arctic of BCemissions is still warming from each of the HTAP regionssince RF changes in the northern mid-latitudes and tropicshave a large positive impact on Arctic temperatures by in-creasing the meridional heat transport. In fact in this studyBC emissions from SA have the largest impact on Arctictemperatures since they exert a strong RF over the tropicsand northern mid-latitudes and little over the Arctic. The re-
sponses in the Arctic to BC emissions might be expected to
be more sensitive to the more northerly source regions if BCdeposition to snow were accounted for.
The ARTP(20) values are shown, but the latitudinal pat-
terns will be identical for any time horizon, albeit with dif-ferent overall scaling. The aerosol impacts on the northern

These are slightly larger than the calculated AGTPs inthe previous section, which implicitly used global averagedclimate sensitivity. This difference can be considered as anefﬁcacy larger than unity due to the forcing being concen-trated at the higher northern latitudes where the climate re-sponse is stronger.4.2 Methane

we have no information on its latitudinal proﬁle. The RF
and ARTP distributions are shown in Fig. 6. For methane,the forcings are more evenly distributed as methane is well-mixed, with the maximum RF in the tropics, but a signif-icant RF in both the southern and northern extra-tropics.The ARTPs show less temperature response in the southern
extra-tropics as this region is less sensitive to RF changesoutside these latitudes. As for the aerosols, the latitudinal pat-
tern of the temperature response to methane emissions doesnot vary with time.

ence between short and long-term components. The net forc-
ings are negative in the Southern Hemisphere and tropicswhere methane destruction outweighs the ozone production,but positive in the northern mid and high latitudes (exceptfor SA emissions which have negative forcing in the north-
ern high latitudes). For NMVOC and CO emissions, the χ

The corresponding ARTPs are shown in Fig. 8. For the
ARTP(20)s, the long-term component is more importantthan the short-term component and the ARTPs for the non-methane ozone precursors look similar to the methane ARTP,with an opposite sign for NO
xemissions. The highest re-
sponse is in the northern mid-latitudes for VOCs and CO. For
the ARTP(100) the contributions of the short and long-term
components are more balanced. For NO xthe ARTP(100)s are
close to zero in the northern mid-latitudes for emissions fromEA and NA reﬂecting the warming from ozone balancing thecooling from decreased methane.
All the results from HTAP were based on changing North-
ern Hemisphere emissions. We do not have results fromSouthern Hemisphere experiments, but might expect the
forcing and temperature responses to be stronger in the hemi-sphere in to which the species are emitted.
5 Limitations and uncertainties
We acknowledge limitations to this study in this section,
most importantly the neglect of the aerosol-cloud interac-tions. As a consequence, care must be taken in using someof the numerical values presented in Table 2.
5.1 Changes in stratospheric ozone
As previously discussed in Fry et al. (2012) the ozone forc-
ing here only includes ozone changes below the tropopause.Søvde et al. (2012) calculate a forcing contribution fromozone responses above the tropopause of 15 % of the total.Adding this would take the ozone contribution to the methanemetrics to 24 % of the direct methane effect. This ends up be-ing a similar value to the 25 ±15 % often used (e.g. Forster et
al., 2007) which came originally from the troposphere-only
responses of a mixture of 2-D and 3-D models discussed in
chapter 2 of IPCC (1994).
5.2 Aerosol interactions with clouds and snow albedo
The responses to aerosol emission changes were calculated
using chemical transport models that omit interactions withclouds, so the RFs presented here only include direct effectsbased on the aerosol column loadings (Yu et al., 2013). Theindirect effects of aerosols are likely to be as great as the

direct effect for hydrophilic aerosols (sulphate and POM in
this study) and may also be important for BC. The indirecteffects are likely to vary with emission region depending ontheir proximity to stratiform clouds and the regional aerosolloading. The impact of BC deposition on snow albedo is alsovery uncertain. Bond et al. (2011) estimate that it adds about20 % to the RF for BC emissions from NA, EU and SA,and about 10 % for EA emissions. This might be expected topreferentially increase the temperature responses in the Arc-
tic latitudes.
5.3 Nitrate aerosols
NO
xemissions have an additional cooling effect by generat-
ing ammonium nitrate aerosols in regions of high ammoniaabundance. Unfortunately, nitrate aerosols were not includedin many of the HTAP simulations, but we can use the resultsof Bauer et al. (2007) who calculated a normalised direct RFfrom global anthropogenic NO
xemissions of -2.0 ×10−12
Wm−2kg−1. This would add −25 and −3.3 to the “All” NO x
GTP(20) and (100) and ( −62 and −2.2 in Table 2), making
these consistently negative.
5.4 CO 2from methane oxidation
Methane is oxidised in the atmosphere, with a molar frac-
tionεof between 0.5 and 1.0 resulting in CO 2(Boucher
et al., 2009). This provides an emission of CO 2equal to
ε×(44/16) ×[CH 4]/αCH4which has its own climate impact
(the factor 44/16 converts from a molar fraction to a massfraction). Thus the addition to the methane GTP is:

AGTPCO2(H−t)dt
The methane oxidation adds 1.3 ±0.4 and 2.1 ±0.7 to
the GTP(20) and GTP(100) respectively as in Boucher etal. (2009). Note that for non-fossil methane this extra CO
2
is still produced as described above, but should be compen-
sated for by previous uptake of CO 2. Thus the above cor-
rection should not be applied to non-fossil methane withoutalso accounting for the uptake, requiring detailed life-cycleanalysis (for instance of the production of cattle fodder).
5.5 Carbon cycle effects
Changes to the atmospheric composition of gases and
aerosols can also affect the carbon cycle thus adding further
indirect climate impacts (e.g. Sitch et al., 2007). Collins et
al. (2010) showed that adding in the effects of surface ozoneon vegetation damage and reduced uptake of CO
2added
about 10 % to the methane GTP(20) and could change thesign of the NO
xGTPs. Hence the sign of the net impact of
NOxemissions is still uncertain.
The temperature changes calculated in the GTPs can also
lead to an impact on the carbon cycle, for instance throughincreased soil respiration. The above calculations of GWPand GTP for species ias ratios AGWP
i/AGWPCO2and
AGTPi/AGTPCO2treat this inconsistently (as do many other

using carbon cycle models ﬁnd that this can underestimatethe GTPs for methane by 20 %. A way of obtaining a sim-ple estimate of this effect is to make the crude assumption
that the change in the land-atmosphere ﬂux of CO
2is lin-
early proportionally to the surface temperature change witha coefﬁcient /Gamma1. Multi-model comparisons of carbon cycle
models (Friedlingstein et al., 2006; Arora et al., 2013) sug-gest a change in the land and ocean uptake of approximately−1G t C y r

a/Gamma1of+(44/12) ×1012kg(CO 2)y r−1K−1. We associate an
uncertainty of 100 % with this to reﬂect a range from no ef-fect to twice what we have quoted. Treating the decreaseduptake as an extra CO

tion to the AGTP due to the climate-carbon cycle feedbackof:

climate=H/integraldisplay
0/Gamma1×AGTPi(t)×AGTPCO2(H−t)dt
Note that because the AGTPCO2does include the climate
feedback we do not need to iterate this calculation any fur-
ther. The contributions to the methane GTP from methaneoxidation and climate-carbon cycle feedback are illustratedin Fig. 9 along with the direct methane impact (i.e. exclud-ing ozone, sulphate and stratospheric water vapour). Theclimate-carbon cycle feedback effects are potentially large
adding 1.7 ±1.7 and 4.3 ±4.3 to the methane GTPs at 20 and
100 yr (55 and 3.6 in Table 2). Note that the climate-carbon
cycle feedback will also affect GWPs too, adding 4.5 ±4.5
to the methane GWP(100) value (24.2 in Fry et al., 2012).For aerosols and the short-term component of ozone precur-sors this climate-carbon cycle feedback could add 17 % and170 % to the 20 and 100 yr GTPs and 4 % and 20 % to the20 and 100 yr GWPs. The CO
2impacts are more important
over longer timescales as they persist for considerably longerthan the direct effects, since CO
2continues to be released for
some time after the pulse of the original emitted species hasdecayed.
5.6 Temperature response
One major uncertainty is in the assumptions about the tem-
perature response, both the timescales of the temperature re-sponse function Rand the latitudinal patterns included in the
k
lm. Olii ´e and Peters (2012) explore the sensitivity of GTP
to model spread in Rand ﬁnd that uncertainties increase
with time horizon and decrease with lifetime. For GTPCH4an
uncertainty of −12/+10 % was found for a 20 yr time hori-
zon, which increased to −77/+75 % for a time horizon of
100 yr (for 5th–95th percentiles). Higher uncertainty rangeswere calculated for short-lived species such as aerosols; for20 yr time horizon these were −59/+85 % and −88/+80 %
for 100 yr.
6 Conclusions
We have examined the climate impacts of aerosols and reac-
tive gases, characterising them using metrics to inform policymakers of the relative importance of the different species, thedependence of impacts on emissions location, and the poten-tial impacts of control policies. The analytical formulae con-
structed here could be used to calculate metrics for similar
experiments in the literature (or yet to be performed) that re-port RFs and methane lifetime changes.
For the aerosol species the chain from RF to GWP to GTP
adds little extra information on the relative differences sincethey are simply scalings of each other. Hence the relative
global importance of emissions of different species from dif-ferent regions remains unchanged from Yu et al. (2013). Theinter-model variability is larger than the variability betweenemission regions, suggesting that a single metric averagedover all emitting regions would be a usable approximation.The small differences between regions that are suggested area lower climate impact for the emission of SO
2and POM
from East Asia, and a higher climate impact for the emissionof BC from Europe.
We calculate GTP

and 100 yr after including a correction for the expected in-creases in lower stratospheric ozone. Adding in the effects of

climate-carbon cycle feedbacks and CO 2from methane oxi-
dation would increase these to 59 ±9 and 10.1 ±4.5.
For ozone precursors, the relative importance of the short
and long-term components varies with the time horizon used.This is most noticeable for NO
xemissions where the short
and long-term components act in opposite directions so theGTP
NOxs are dominated by the negative methane component
on the 20 yr timescale, but after 100 yr the ozone compo-nent plays a more signiﬁcant role. As with the GWPs (Fryet al., 2012), the GTPs for the ozone precursors are largelyindependent of source region for emissions in the north-ern mid-latitudes, with larger magnitudes for NO
xand VOC
emissions from the more tropical SA region due to more ac-tive photochemistry.
The different patterns of responses when moving down the
impact chain become more apparent when breaking downthe temperature changes into latitude bands. There is no di-
rect relationship between the RF in a region and the surfacetemperature change in that region. Even when using broadlatitude bands, there are contributions to the surface tem-
perature from RF outside the region, although that contribu-
tion decreases with latitudinal distance. Thus, the latitudinaltemperature patterns can differ signiﬁcantly from the globalmean, and also from the latitudinal forcing patterns.
The RF from sulphate and POM aerosols peaks strongly
over the latitudes of the emissions, and so the northern mid-
latitude temperature response to northern mid-latitude emis-
sions is approximately twice as large as the global average.For BC there is a large RF component over the Arctic; how-ever this leads to a cooling of the Artic surface. Thereforethe Arctic temperatures are most sensitive to emissions fromSA since a larger proportion of BC emitted from the other
more northerly regions is advected to the Arctic upper tropo-sphere. This excludes the effects on Artic temperatures ex-
pected from BC deposition to snow which might increasethe importance of the more northerly emission regions on theArctic.
The RFs and RTPs for CH
4, VOC and CO emissions show
smoother latitudinal proﬁles than for the aerosols with a typ-
ically 20–30 % greater temperature response in the northernmid-latitudes than the global average. NO
xemissions from
the Northern Hemisphere source regions lead to negative RFsin the Southern Hemisphere and the tropics and positive RFs
in the northern mid-high latitudes. The resulting temperaturechanges however are cooling in all latitudes, with the excep-tions of northern mid-latitude responses to EA and NA emis-sions on the 100 yr timescale (although the 100 yr responsesare extremely small).
The ﬁndings in this paper begin to address important pol-
icy questions of whether emissions controls within a region
have a larger climate effect in that region, and whether NTCFmitigation controls can be optimised for their impacts on vul-nerable regions such as the Arctic.Acknowledgements. This work was funded under the EU
