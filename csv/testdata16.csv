Abstract
Climate change is projected to push the limits of cropping systems and has the potential to disrupt the agricultural
sector from local to global scales. This article introduces the Coordinated Climate-Crop Modeling Project (C3MP), an
initiative of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) to engage a global network
of crop modelers to explore the impacts of climate change via an investigation of crop responses to changes in carbondioxide concentration ([CO
2]), temperature, and water. As a demonstration of the C3MP protocols and enabled analy-
ses, we apply the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) CROPGRO-Peanut crop model for
Henry County, Alabama, to evaluate responses to the range of plausible [CO 2], temperature changes, and precipita-
tion changes projected by climate models out to the end of the 21st century. These sensitivity tests are used to derivecrop model emulators that estimate changes in mean yield and the coefﬁcient of variation for seasonal yields across a
broad range of climate conditions, reproducing mean yields from sensitivity test simulations with deviations of ca.
2% for rain-fed conditions. We apply these statistical emulators to investigate how peanuts respond to projectionsfrom various global climate models, time periods, and emissions scenarios, ﬁnding a robust projection of modest(<10%) median yield losses in the middle of the 21st century accelerating to more severe ( >20%) losses and larger
uncertainty at the end of the century under the more severe representative concentration pathway (RCP8.5). This pro-
jection is not substantially altered by the selection of the AgMERRA global gridded climate dataset rather than thelocal historical observations, differences between the Third and Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3and CMIP5), or the use of the delta method of climate impacts analysis rather than the C3MP impacts response sur-
face and emulator approach.

Introduction
Climate change is projected to impact agricultural sys-
tems most directly through changes in temperature, pre-
cipitation, and carbon dioxide concentration ([CO 2]),
with crop responses varying across farms depending onthe cultivar, management, soil, and baseline climate.Additional factors (including pests, diseases, weeds,extreme climate events, water resources, soil degrada-tion, agrotechnological development, and economicpressures) will also inﬂuence the fate of future agriculturalproduction and deserve scrutiny. There is much to be
learned in examining the response of agricultural sys-tems to the core carbon dioxide, temperature, and water
(CTW) changes, however (Hatﬁeld et al., 2011).
Crop models provide a biophysical process-based
tool to investigate crop responses in light of environ-
mental conditions and farm management, and have
been applied to climate impact assessment using a vari-ety of methods (see review by White et al., 2011). The
utility of these climate change applications is hindered,however, by the small (1 ha) scale of most process-
based crop models, the considerable effort required to
achieve satisfactory calibration at a given site, methodo-logical uncertainties, errors in historical climate datasets

of agreement among various crop models’ responses toCTW changes (R €otter et al., 2011). Most importantly, to
date there has not been a coordinated effort to performclimate impacts analyses with a large number of crops,crop models, and detailed crop modeling sites around
the world.
While the execution of a single site’s crop model is
relatively cheap, the coordination of agricultural
impacts assessments at larger scales require consistentand timely contributions from a large number of cropmodelers, and this effort cannot be duplicated eachtime a new global climate model (GCM), downscalingtechnique, or scenario result is created. In addition,evaluation of a subset of GCM simulations is not sufﬁ-cient to separate important interactions in crop model
response. A mechanism is therefore needed to rapidly
assess the climate impacts across a wide envelope ofclimate change space to enable an investigation ofuncertainties from any single-GCM or multi-GCM andmulti-RCM ensemble (Deser et al., 2012).
The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Imp-
rovement Project (AgMIP; Rosenzweig et al., 2013) was
created to substantially improve the climate, crop, and
economic simulation tools that are used to characterize
the agricultural sector, to assess future world food secu-rity under changing climate conditions, and to enhanceadaptation capacity in both developing and developedcountries. AgMIP has led detailed model intercompari-sons at highly observed ﬁeld sites for wheat (Assenget al., 2013), rice (Li et al., unplublished data), maize
(Bassu et al., unpublished data), and sugarcane (Singels
et al., 2013), ﬁnding largely consistent response patterns
across models. It is also clear that crop model selectioncan be an important factor in an assessment of climateimpacts for any given location due to the processes andmechanisms emphasized in the modeling approach.AgMIP is also employing global gridded crop models(GGCMs) to simulate global agricultural production(e.g., Rosenzweig et al., in press, compare 7 GGCMs on
a global ½degree grid) relying on large geodatasets of
soil and climate as well as biophysical algorithms todetermine likely grid cell inputs for management and
cultivars.
The following sections describe a new AgMIP initia-
tive that is coordinating detailed crop model simula-tions on a global network for climate change impactassessments. To demonstrate the utility of the simula-
tions that will be run at each site and establish a com-
mon methodology of evaluation, we present resultsfrom a prototype peanut modeling site in HenryCounty, Alabama, USA. Henry County is a majorproducer at the center of the Southeastern US peanutbelt, and quality soil, meteorology, and managementinformation allow for a robust simulation of yield
impacts in light of a changing climate. Results fromHenry County are used to discuss the potential beneﬁtsof this prototype approach being repeated across alarge number of locations, crop species, and crop mod-els to enable more comprehensive climate impactsanalysis.
Materials and methods
The Coordinated Climate-Crop Modeling Project (C3MP)
The Coordinated Climate-Crop Modeling Project (C3MP;
http://www.agmip.org/c3mp) was created as an AgMIP ini-
tiative to provide consistent information about crop yieldresponse to CTW changes across a large, distributed, and glo-bal network of established crop modeling sites to facilitate cli-
mate impacts assessments. The work builds on earlier efforts
at the site scale (R €ais€anen & Ruokalainen, 2006; Ferrise et al. ,
2011; Ruane et al., 2013) and at the regional scale (Howden &
Crimp, 2005; Crimp et al., 2008; Iizumi et al., 2010) that com-
bine crop model sensitivity tests with crop response emulators(statistical representations of models) across a wide uncer-
tainty space.
All C3MP participants follow a set of common protocols in
which contributors register to participate in a crop modeling
experiment to execute 99 sensitivity tests, generated using a
Latin Hypercube approach, which explore the plausible
range of [CO
2], temperature, and precipitation changes pro-
jected to occur out at the 2070 –2099 time period (Table 1; full
protocols are available at http://www.agmip.org/
c3mp-downloads). These ranges include the projectedextremes from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project (CMIP5; Taylor et al. , 2009) over the vast majority of
agricultural lands and, in fact, are intended to extend slightlybeyond this range to ensure that C3MP results remainrelevant in the event that more extreme projections become
plausible (Fig. 1). In addition to the range of projected tem-
perature increases, sensitivity tests extend to a 1 °C cooling
to understand optimal growing conditions which may be
cooler than the historical baseline. As the C3MP protocols
require the same sensitivity tests for all crop modeling loca-tions, the range of precipitation changes is limited to /C650%
to prevent the sensitivity tests from being too sparse in the
precipitation change space simply to accommodate arid
regions where projections indicate large percentage changes
to small historical precipitation totals. It is important to
mention that changes in rainfall are restricted to changes in
intensity, and changes in the frequency of precipitationevents are not taken into account in this study, even though
they potentially play an important role in ﬁnal yields (Baigor-
riaet al., 2007). Whereas the ﬁnal years of the 21st century
have [CO
2] higher than 900 ppm in the highest Representa-
tive Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5; Moss et al., 2010), the
end-of-century time period (2070 –2099) has a central year
[CO 2] of 801 ppm. The 330 ppm lower limit of the [CO 2]
range helps resolve CO 2sensitivities around the 1980 –2010
historical baseline’s central year [CO 2] in 1995 =360 ppm).
©2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Global Change Biology ,20, 394–407CARBON –TEMPERATURE –WATER CHANGE ANALYSIS 395The sensitivity tests are generated by modifying each day in
the 1980 –2010 climate series to achieve each test’s temperature
change (through addition), precipitation change (through a
multiplicative factor), and [CO 2] (via an imposed concentra-
tion), resulting in 2970 (99 tests 930 years) yields per simula-
tion set. The mean yield (Y) is then calculated for each
sensitivity test and associated with the [CO 2], temperature,
and water changes that deﬁned each test. To understand howclimate changes may affect yield variability (Osborne &
Wheeler, 2013), the coefﬁcient of variation for yield (CV;
across the 30 years) is also calculated. This enables the least-squares ﬁtting of a quadratic crop model emulator for Y and
CV for any given simulation location as a function of carbon
dioxide concentration (CO
2), temperature change (T), and
precipitation change (P) to determine coefﬁcients a –ki ne a c ho f :YðCO 2;T;PÞ¼aþbðTÞþcðTÞ2þdðPÞþeðPÞ2þfðCO 2ÞþgðCO 2Þ2

As the emulators for mean yield and yield CV are ﬁt sepa-
rately, the values of coefﬁcients a –k in Eqn (1) will not be the
same as a –k in Eqn (2). In addition, the impacts response
surfaces deﬁned by these emulators are a better subject of com-
parison than the values of speciﬁc coefﬁcients (the response to
any climatic change is represented in multiple coefﬁcients).
The formulation of this crop model emulator will be an impor-
tant area of ongoing research in C3MP, as it is possible that
some locations’ mean yield or yield CV responses may be bet-
ter captured by other forms (e.g., polynomials of a different
order or logarithmic functions). Howden & Crimp (2005) useda simpler linear emulator, but then Crimp et al. (2008) modiﬁed
this to include quadratics with different orders of polynomials
for [CO
2] (to the fourth order), temperature (to the third order),
and precipitation (to the second order). Ruane et al. (2013) uti-
lized second-order polynomials to emulate impacts response
surfaces for maize in Panama to mimic a yield curve peaking atTable 1 Limits of CTW space, relative to baseline climate
conditions, explored by sensitivity tests. Corresponding base-

[CO 2], but to this point these studies have not included the
cross-variable terms in Eqns (1) and (2). These terms allow fornon-orthogonal curvature in the crop response space resulting
from interactions in the way crop models respond to multiple,
simultaneously changing climate variables. These cross-termsare additionally helpful in understanding how correlated
climate variables affect yields (Sheehy et al. , 2006). Ramankutty
et al. (2013) tested linear, nonlinear, and spline ﬁts for a grass-
land site in Australia, which could be repeated for any site par-
ticipating in C3MP. It should also be noted that these climate
impact emulators are derived from 30-year climatological crop
model results rather than the year-by-year historical climatevariability that is often used to develop statistical crop models
(e.g., Schlenker & Roberts, 2009; Schlenker & Lobell, 2010). The
use of process-based crop models for impacts analysis has theadded beneﬁt of including directly resolved interactions
between various terms and [CO
2] that may be outside of the
range of recent observations in a given region. Lobell & Burke(2010) performed a similar regression using crop model simu-lations (although based on crop model simulations of interan-
nual variability), ﬁnding that quadratic regressions
outperformed linear models.
To ensure consistency across sites and encourage the contri-
bution of crop modeling simulations from regions where cli-
mate information does not exist or is not available, C3MP
provides an estimated daily climate series for the 1980 –2010
historical baseline period. Based on the outputs of the NASA
Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applica-
tions (MERRA; Rienecker et al., 2011) and MERRA-Land
(Reichle et al. , 2011) outputs, these AgMERRA data (A.C. Ru-
ane, unpublished data) were developed for agricultural
impacts applications and are shifted to eliminate apparentmonthly biases in comparison to an ensemble of gridded
observational data from weather stations and satellites (CRU
TS3.10, Harris et al. , 2013; Willmott & Matsuura, 1995; GPCC,
Rudolf & Schneider, 2004; CMORPH, Joyce et al., 2004; PERSI-
ANN, Hsu et al., 1997; TRMM 3B-42, Huffman et al., 2007).
AgMERRA also incorporates the NASA-GEWEX Solar Radia-tion Budget daily radiation data (Zhang et al., 2007) which
have been shown to be highly useful for agricultural modeling
(White et al., 2008), and is stored at a resolution of ¼degree.
Where complete and well-vetted station data are available,
C3MP participants are encouraged to run both the observa-
tional and the AgMERRA climate series through their crop
models to gage uncertainties stemming from the selection of
baseline climate series.
White et al. (2011) summarized the substantial contributions
of crop modeling assessments of climate change impactsaround the world, ﬁnding studies in 69 countries (dominatedby North America and Europe) and using 68 crop models.
There are many missed opportunities for collaboration, how-
ever, because for any given region it is difﬁcult to discover theextent of work that has been completed and to contact crop
modelers with experience over the range of agricultural
systems. Many sites and models have also been calibratedfor operational use, but have never appeared in the peer-
reviewed literature. In some cases differences between variousmodeling studies lead to confusion among the stakeholder
and policymaker communities, as multiple assessments in the
same region can occasionally produce results that appearcontradictory. C3MP is therefore designed to build the
network of crop modelers and crop modeling sites around the
world to conduct climate vulnerability analyses, enable inter-comparison of consistent results, increase communication,
and facilitate future collaborations among participants.
A prototype demonstration of the C3MP protocols and
enabled analyses is provided below to describe the methods
and analyses enabled that are envisioned for all C3MP simula-
tion set locations.
C3MP prototype simulation of peanut yield in Henry
County, Alabama
For this prototype simulation set, the core response of peanut
yields to climate change was simulated in Henry County, Ala-bama, which is located near the heart of a productive peanut-
growing belt in the Southeastern United States (Fig. 2). An
additional site was also conﬁgured in nearby Washington
County, Florida, for the purposes of regional comparison, but
Henry County will be the primary focus of this study.
Peanut simulations were conducted using CROPGRO-
Peanut (Boote et al., 1998), which is an element of the Deci-
sion Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer Cropping
System Model (DSSAT-CSM; Jones et al., 2003). The sensitiv-
ity tests were facilitated by the use of DSSAT’s Environ-mental Modiﬁcations function, which modiﬁes historicalclimate data to achieve each test’s temperature, precipita-
tion, and [CO
2]. The key details of the crop model conﬁgu-
ration are summarized in Table 2, and describe a rain-fedpeanut simulation with planting on April 1st. The simula-
tions use the Georgia Green cultivar, which was calibrated
for phenology, biomass, and yield components at ﬁeld trials

et al., 2003). Weather data from 1980 to 2010 were collected
from the Florida Climate Center (Ofﬁce of the State Clima-tologist, 2012), with radiation estimated from daily tempera-
tures and precipitation. The soil proﬁle was drawn from a
reanalyzed soil dataset (Romero et al., 2012), and manage-
ment followed common local practices. To gage the uncer-
tainty of this conﬁguration and test some of the C3MP
analysis methods below, additional simulation sets were
also conﬁgured. These include a nearly identical simulationset that utilizes an irrigation rule whereby 12 mm applica-
tions of irrigation are applied whenever soil water content
drops below 70% of plant available water in the top 50 cmof the soil proﬁle. Simulations at Washington County, Flor-
ida, were also run that differ only in their use of a local
baseline climate series and soil proﬁle. Lastly, the samesimulations were run for Henry County using baseline cli-
mate series drawn from AgMERRA’s corresponding grid
box. Note that MERRA likely incorporates a version of thestate climatologist data in its underlying data assimilation,
so the skill of AgMERRA in this region may be higher than
in regions where no local weather stations exist. Peanut
simulations in the US Southeast were also conducted by
Shin et al. (2010) with a focus on interannual variability.
Results
Historical baseline evaluation
A comparison between simulated peanut yields and
the 1980 –2010 county-level yields reported by the US
Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Sta-
tistics Service (NASS; USDA, 2012) reveals a high levelof agreement for the rain-fed simulations driven by the
state climatologist observations (Fig. 3; correlation coef-ﬁcient r=0.52; signiﬁcant at 0.01 level using t-test).
Rain-fed simulations driven by the AgMERRA datasetproduced nearly identical correlations ( r=0.5; signiﬁ-
cant at 0.01 level). Irrigated correlations were not signif-
icant for either climate series due to the low prevalence
of irrigation systems in the region. The performance of
rain-fed simulations is particularly strong given that
the county-level yields integrate across a variety ofmanagement types, soil characteristics, cultivars, andapplications across Henry County. Washington Countycorrelations were lower than Henry County, but betterfor AgMERRA ( r=0.29) than for state climatologist
observations ( r=0.19), likely due to heterogeneous
farming practices blurred together in aggregated NASS
yield data. The crop model also assumes that pests,
diseases, and weeds are perfectly controlled, which isnot always the case in the real world.
CTW response surfaces
The emulators ﬁt by Eqns (1) and (2) allow for the esti-mation of crop model response to any point in theCTW change space for Henry County peanuts. To testthe skill of this emulator against the direct simulation
of a given scenario, each of the sensitivity tests was esti-
mated using the emulator and compared to the crop
model’s simulation of that test, resulting in root meansquare deviations (RMSD, as a percentage of mean1980 –2010 yield) of 1.90% and 1.96% for rain-fed condi-
tions with the observed climate and AgMERRA, respec-tively, and Pearson’s correlations ( r
2) greater than 0.99.
For irrigated conditions mean yield RMSD wereslightly smaller (1.25% and 2.3% for the two climate
series). Omitting 20 of these sensitivity tests randomly
did not substantially change the emulator, with RMSDchanging by less than 0.1% of the mean yields and r
2
remaining above 0.99. Yield CV had higher emulator
RMSD in the rain-fed conditions (2.30% and 3.37%;
r2>0.99), and much higher RMSD for irrigated condi-
tions (9.36% and 6.96%; r2>0.98), although the latter is
a result of the much smaller CV for irrigated conditions
that face little or no interannual water stresses. Overall,
the emulators appear to be robustly capturing the coreresponse of the crop model regardless of the baselineclimate series utilized. These emulators may technicallybe extrapolated outside of the C3MP climate changelimits deﬁned in Table 2; however, this must be donewith caution as the statistical properties of the moder-ate-to-large climate changes may not hold in the case of
more extreme climate changes.
The three-dimensional CTW space is most easily
examined by looking at cross sections where one of theTable 2 Overview of the rain-fed peanut model simulation

simulations were also run for Washington County, Florida,

(Fig. 4). The general response of rain-fed Henry County
mean yields is as might be expected, but the generaldecrease in yields under warmer and drier conditionswith lower [CO
2], as well as the increase in yields in
cooler, wetter, and higher [CO 2] environments may now
be quantiﬁed. Yield CV responds most strongly to pre-
cipitation (wetter conditions leading to lower CV andmore consistent interannual yields), although warmer
conditions have the potential to offset CV decreases
from wetter conditions, probably through a combinationof increased evapotranspiration and a closer proximityto damaging high-temperature thresholds.
These emulators enhance our understanding of crop
model responses in their ability to identify nonlineari-ties in crop response, explore interactions in CTWresponse, and quickly assess climate change scenarios.
For example, if [CO
2] is held at the baseline levels
(Fig. 4a), the sensitivity of mean yield to rising temper-
atures is higher under wet conditions than under drier
conditions, indicating that peanut is more responsive toheat stress when there is no competing water stress.Likewise, if temperatures are held at the baseline levels(Fig. 4c and d), an increase in [CO
2] to 700 ppm can off-
set mean yield losses resulting from a 30% decrease in
growing season precipitation, although the yield CV
will increase by about 25%. Finally, if precipitation isheld constant (Fig. 4e), peanut responds to rising [CO
2]
in a nearly linear fashion if temperatures do not changebut shows diminishing returns and very little response
beyond about 600 ppm when temperatures increase by
more than 5 °C.
To further explore the robustness of these emulators
and the potential for broader C3MP analysis, Fig. 5 pre-
sents differences between the impacts response cross
sections calculated using different climate series (leftcolumn), different locations (middle column), and dif-ferent irrigation regimes (right column). There is very
little difference between an emulator based on the
sensitivity tests applied to the observational climatedataset and that created from sensitivity tests applied tothe AgMERRA dataset. A comparison between Figs 4cand 5c suggests that the use of the AgMERRA climatedataset leads to slightly less optimistic simulations ofthe yield beneﬁts when both [CO
2] and precipitation
rise dramatically, but the overall pattern of response is
very similar. The AgMERRA dataset is therefore a suit-
able alternative for the C3MP exercise for peanut simu-lations in Henry County, which encourages its furtherapplication in regions where observational data are notavailable. Differences between the observed weather
data and the AgMERRA estimates will also elucidateagricultural regions where gridded climate datasets
may be missing key agroclimatic processes.
Although Henry and Washington Counties are only
ca. 100 km apart and have small differences in meanclimate, lower root zone soil saturation levels in HenryCounty lead to unique CTW responses. This is apparent

high in Henry County (0.47) as they are in WashingtonCounty (0.26) due to a higher sensitivity to droughtconditions (correlations between rain-fed yield and
growing season precipitation are 0.79 and 0.62, respec-
tively; both signiﬁcant at P=0.001 level). The overall
pattern of impacts response in Henry and WashingtonCounties is consistent (Fig. 5, center column), althoughWashington County is less sensitive to changes inprecipitation. This highlights the role of water stress asthe major difference between these locations’ CTW
responses, and their differences look very similar to
(although weaker than) the differences between rain-
fed and irrigated conditions at Henry County (Fig. 5,right column; which represent a nearly complete elimi-nation of water stress). A comparison between therain-fed and irrigated conditions also helps quantify
the beneﬁts of irrigation as an adaptation for future cli-mate changes. Both respond in a similar fashion when
temperature increases are above 4 °C and precipitation
is at least as much as in the present climate. Rain-fed
conditions at Henry County are also more responsive
to the beneﬁts of elevated [CO
2] than Washington
County and the irrigated Henry County simulations,illustrating the effects of improved water retention inhigh-CO
2environments (Kimball, 2010).
Instantaneous sensitivities
The framework allows for the calculation of the instan-taneous sensitivity to changes in carbon, temperature,
and water by calculating the slope of the emulated
Fig. 4 Cross sections of crop model emulators based upon sensitivity test results for percent changes (relative to baseline conditions) of
mean peanut yield (a, c, e; left color bar) and changes in the coefﬁcient of variation for yield (b, d, f; right color bar) in Henry County,
Alabama, for (a –b) temperature and precipitation response at baseline [CO 2]; (c–d) precipitation and [CO 2] at baseline temperature;
and (e –f) temperature and [CO 2] at baseline precipitation. The black stars in each panel represent baseline conditions (no change in
temperature or precipitation and 360ppm [CO 2]).

that the response of peanut yield to temperature and
precipitation changes takes the shape of a curved sur-
face that peaks at optimum conditions, the optimalgrowing season climate is found where the slope of thistemperature –water surface is zero (crops are assumed
to respond favorably to increased [CO
2] in all climates).
In general, yields are expected to fall off at an accelerat-ing pace as the climate moves away from these optimalconditions, but the historical baseline climate is not
necessarily optimal. It is important to note that the
sensitivities calculated from the C3MP emulators arebased on 30-year climate shifts, which likely differ fromyield sensitivities to interannual climate shifts (Ruaneet al., 2013).
The instantaneous sensitivities of peanut simulations
in Henry County to changes away from its historicalbaseline climate (marked with a star in Figs 4 and 5)
indicate that optimal conditions are somewhat coolerand wetter than the 1980 –2009 climate. Yields decrease
by 11.7% per 1 °C rise in mean growing season tempera-
ture, and increase by 8.5% per 10% increase in mean
growing season rainfall. Under irrigated conditionsmean yield decreases 8.6% per 1 °C rise and there is no
response to increasing rainfall (indicating that irrigationacts as optimal water conditions). Rain-fed and irrigatedpeanuts respond to a 100 ppm increase in [CO
2] with
similar 12.8% and 11.2% increases in yield, respectively.
Probabilistic Analysis of CMIP5 projections
The C3MP impacts response surfaces also extend the
utility of the 99 sensitivity tests by enabling speciﬁc
scenarios to be rapidly explored. As any scenario can
be summarized by its growing season [CO 2], temperature
change, and precipitation change from the historicalbaseline period, these CTW changes can be pluggedinto the emulators to estimate agricultural impacts.

changes in temperature and precipitation for HenryCounty, Alabama, across various time slices in anensemble of 20 GCMs that contributed to CMIP5. These20 GCMs are the subset that had posted (as of October,2012) daily output through at least 2099 for RCPsreﬂecting higher (RCP8.5) and lower (RCP4.5) [CO
2].
The projections agree on progressive warming over the
course of the 21st century; however, the rate of that
warming is highly dependent on the RCP and there islittle agreement on the direction of precipitationchanges. Incorporating [CO
2] determined for any given
time slice from the RCP, each GCM time-slice projec-
tion was emulated to produce probabilistic estimates ofparticular yield and yield CV thresholds according tothe CMIP5 ensemble (Table 3).
Examining an extreme yield threshold deﬁned by
mean 30-year yields that are only 80% of the meanyields in the historical baseline, the CMIP5 GCMs sug-gest that farmers in Henry County do not face a 20%mean yield decrease until the end-of-century (2070 –
2099) period under RCP4.5 (when only 17 of the 20models have emulated mean yields above this thresh-
old). Under RCP8.5, however, this level of threat is
reached in the mid-century (2040 –2069) and a minority
of the GCMs project yields above this threshold during
the end-of-century time slice. On the other end of thespectrum, farmers hoping for even modest mean yieldincreases ( >105% of the baseline) ﬁnd only a 25% proba-
bility in the near-term (2010 –2039) under RCP4.5 and
then a 10% change beyond that period. Results are simi-lar for irrigated peanut, although the probability of
yield increases is slightly lower (5%).
Yield CV is also projected to increase with very high
probability. For rain-fed conditions only 40% of models
project CVs less than the baseline period in the near
term, with probabilities declining in future periods inboth RCPs. CVs are projected to increase to more than120% of their baseline value by the midcentury periodwith high probability under irrigated conditions (where
CV is already quite small), with all models projecting
higher than 40% increases in CV at the RCP8.5 end ofcentury.
Comparison of CMIP5 and CMIP3 projections
To compare between the current state of the art and the
projections used for a large number of previous climate
change impact studies, Fig. 6b shows a comparison inprojected growing season mean temperature andprecipitation changes among the same 20 CMIP5 GCMs
under RCP8.5 and 16 GCMs from the higher emissions
scenario (A2; SRES, 2000) of the previous-generationCMIP3 (Meehl et al., 2007). CMIP3 and CMIP5 resultspotentially disagree due to updates in GCM resolu-
tions, parameterizations, and processes, as well as dif-
ferences between the RCP8.5 and A2 scenarios’
evolution of greenhouse gas concentrations. RCP8.5reaches higher [CO
2] by the end-of-century period than
does A2 (801 ppm and 734 ppm in 2085, respectively),although values are much closer in the near-term(432 ppm and 434 ppm in 2025) and mid-century(571 ppm and 556 ppm in 2055). Even with a largernumber of models, the CMIP5 projections are in stron-
ger agreement as to Henry County temperature and
precipitation changes than are the CMIP3 projections,
although the most extreme temperature changes are
projected under CMIP5’s higher [CO
2] RCP8.5 scenario.

larger precipitation decreases also project greater
warming, indicating a shift in the ratio of latent andsensible energy ﬂuxes as surface moisture changes.
The emulated yield change distributions presented in
Figure 7 show that the general message of climateimpact projections for rain-fed and irrigated peanutproduction in Henry County has not changed dramati-cally from CMIP3 to CMIP5, with both ensembles sug-gesting yield declines by midcentury and acceleratinglosses into the end-of-century period. CMIP5 RCP8.5
projections suggest slightly larger yield losses than do
the CMIP3 A2 simulations; however, the CMIP3 ensem-
ble shows larger uncertainties in the end-of-centuryperiod. The latest CMIP5 projections are therefore more
consistent and more pessimistic than would have beenassessed in previous-generation CMIP3 impact studies,resulting in CMIP3’s most severe and most optimisticend-of-century projections being eliminated.
Comparison of simulated and emulated climate change
impact projections
As a ﬁnal check on the efﬁcacy of the C3MP sensitivity
tests and emulator approach for Henry Countypeanuts, Figure 8 presents a comparison between thedistribution of CMIP5 yield change projections usingthe C3MP emulators and the distribution resulting
from an impacts assessment using the more traditional
“delta method” (Wilby et al., 2004; White et al., 2011).
In the latter approach, changes in mean monthly tem-
peratures and precipitation (calculated by comparing
the climatologies of a future time slice with the histori-cal baseline period in a given GCM) are imposed on theobserved historical period climate series and then usedto drive crop model simulations.
The emulated yield change distributions and directly
simulated yield change distributions indicate the same
general response of Henry County peanuts to CMIP5
climate changes, with yields declining modestly to the
mid-century and then accelerating losses by the end-of-century period. Median yield change projections (red
lines in Fig. 8a –d) are similar; however, the emulated
yields underestimate the spread in uncertainty sug-gested by the delta method simulations. Direct compar-ison between the emulated and simulated yield changeprojections across all GCMs and time periods (Fig.
8e–h) reveals that the emulators tend to be somewhat
conservative, underestimating the most extreme yielddecreases and increases (a similar underestimation wasfound by Lobell & Burke, 2010). In this case the discrep-ancy is likely a combination of the least-squares ﬁtting
of the emulator as well as differences between using
mean growing season temperature and precipitationTable 3 Probabilistic threshold analysis of CMIP5 results under rain-fed (a, c) and irrigated (b, d) conditions for peanut. Results

delta method simulations. Several GCMs have substan-
tial variation in the way that climate changes within a
growing season; however, these changes do not have asdramatic an impact when averaged over a longer grow-ing season. As C3MP is designed to require only asmall set of sensitivity tests from its global participants,investigation of these subseasonal impacts is left tofollow-on studies.
Discussion
The prototype study at Henry County, Alabama,reveals the potential insight and analyses enabled bythe execution of C3MP sensitivity tests. With only a rel-atively small set of simulations, crop modelers aroundthe world are able to provide the crucial carbon diox-
ide, temperature, and water responses that govern the
main agricultural response to climate change. Analysisof GCM projections and the CTW impacts response sur-faces at Henry County reveal modest yield losses accel-erating beyond the middle of the 21st century, withtemperature and water stresses overwhelming the ben-
eﬁts of enhanced [CO
2]. Generalized crop model emu-
lators provide a robust ﬁt to the sensitivity tests, andresults are consistent between this approach and themore involved delta method approach. These emula-tors allow future scenarios to be rapidly assessed forHenry and Washington County peanuts as was donehere for various RCPs, GCMs, and time periods. Yield
(or CV) change threshold analysis also facilitates risk
management either by probabilistic projection (Table 3)
or in terms of identifying the types of climate changes
that cross important change contours in Fig. 4. Simula-tions based on the AgMERRA climate data also satisfac-torily reproduce those based on the state climatologistobservations, motivating expanded applications ofthese data where local observations are not available.
This analysis at the Henry County site is informative,
but the coordination of a global network of C3MP sitesenables larger analyses including the identiﬁcation ofvulnerable subregions and cropping systems in a givenregion, the relative sensitivities to immediate changesin temperature or precipitation, the forms of emulators
that are robust in various farming systems, and the gen-
eral agreement between crop models or sites with
slightly different cultivars and/or farm management.
C3MP results will also increase our ability to gageuncertainties across regions, scenarios, and crop mod-els, as well as providing points of comparison for globalgridded crop model improvement and examinations ofscale dependency in impacts assessment. When C3MPcrop model emulators are combined with climatemodel emulators under development in the
climate modeling community that produce regional
temperature and precipitation changes based on carbon
dioxide concentrations (e.g., Castruccio et al.,i n
review), the combination will allow for rapid statisticalassessment of regional climate impacts based on green-house gas emissions simulated by integrated assess-ment models.
It is also important to recognize limitations in the
C3MP approach. A focus on growing season tempera-
ture and precipitation changes neglects the likelihoodof subseasonal changes in the frequency, distribution,and extremes of these variables, which could substan-tially affect regional yield changes. C3MP also neglects
to differentiate between changes in minimum tempera-
ture and maximum temperature despite a strong physi-cal basis to expect the former to slightly outpace the
latter. C3MP assumes that current management prac-
tices will persist under future climate conditions, lead-ing to a more pessimistic projection that is better usedto recognize the risk of ignoring climate impacts. Inlight of these limitations, C3MP will be of most use forrapid assessment of new scenarios and to identifyRCP8.5  A2−80−60−40−2002040Rainfed CMIP5 vs. CMIP3 mean yield changes

C3MP increases (and encourages) collaboration
among the global network of participants and moti-vates further studies that can be designed to answer
speciﬁc questions of crop response to particular stresses
or differences between various crop model perfor-mances in a given farming system. High-quality experi-ments, free-air carbon enrichment (FACE; Kimball,2010) facilities, and other ﬁeld trials are still required to
most accurately quantify CTW sensitivities andimprove these model simulations and the associatedemulators. AgMIP research projects are underway toimprove regional impacts assessment and increase the
