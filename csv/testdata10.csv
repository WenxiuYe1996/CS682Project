Abstract Irrigation is the single largest anthropogenic
water use, a modiﬁcation of the land surface that signiﬁ-
cantly affects surface energy budgets, the water cycle, andclimate. Irrigation, however, is typically not included in
standard historical general circulation model (GCM) sim-
ulations along with other anthropogenic and natural forc-ings. To investigate the importance of irrigation as an
anthropogenic climate forcing, we conduct two 5-member
ensemble GCM experiments. Both are setup identical to thehistorical forced (anthropogenic plus natural) scenario used
in version 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project,
but in one experiment we also add water to the land surfaceusing a dataset of historically estimated irrigation rates.
Irrigation has a negligible effect on the global average
radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere, but causessigniﬁcant cooling of global average surface air tempera-
tures over land and dampens regional warming trends. This
cooling is regionally focused and is especially strong in
Western North America, the Mediterranean, the Middle
East, and Asia. Irrigation enhances cloud cover and pre-
cipitation in these same regions, except for summer in parts
of Monsoon Asia, where irrigation causes a reduction in
monsoon season precipitation. Irrigation cools the surface,reducing upward ﬂuxes of longwave radiation (increasing
net longwave), and increases cloud cover, enhancing
shortwave reﬂection (reducing net shortwave). The relative
magnitude of these two processes causes regional increases(northern India) or decreases (Central Asia, China) in
energy availability at the surface and top of the atmo-
sphere. Despite these changes in net radiation, however,climate responses are due primarily to larger magnitude
shifts in the Bowen ratio from sensible to latent heating.
Irrigation impacts on temperature, precipitation, and otherclimate variables are regionally signiﬁcant, even while
other anthropogenic forcings (anthropogenic aerosols,
greenhouse gases, etc.) dominate the long term climateevolution in the simulations. To better constrain the mag-
nitude and uncertainties of irrigation-forced climate
anomalies, irrigation should therefore be considered asanother important anthropogenic climate forcing in the
next generation of historical climate simulations and multi-
model assessments.

1 Introduction
General circulation model (GCM) simulations of the his-
torical period (1850–present) use observation based esti-mates of natural (e.g., solar variability, volcanic eruptions)
and anthropogenic [e.g., anthropogenic aerosols, green-
house gas (GHG) concentrations, land use, etc.] forcings tosimulate the last 150 years of climate evolution. Historical
simulations provide an important baseline for understand-
ing the context of future climate change, are used to test
climate system responses to speciﬁc forcings, and are
required for detection and attribution studies. These
experiments therefore form an integral part of the modelintercomparisons organized in tandem with the Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment

DOI 10.1007/s00382-014-2204-7reports (e.g., Taylor et al. 2012 ). Recent historical model-
ing studies have addressed diverse topics, including the
impact of anthropogenic aerosol emissions on North
Atlantic climate variability (Booth et al. 2012 ), the role of
the ocean in the recent surface warming hiatus (Kosaka and
Xie2013 ), and the detection and attribution of anthropo-
genically forced warming trends (Santer et al. 2013 ). One
anthropogenic forcing that is typically not included in
standard historical GCM simulations, including the IPCC
model intercomparisons, is irrigation.
Irrigation is the single largest anthropogenic water use,
accounting for 70 % of global freshwater withdrawals and90 % of consumption (Siebert et al. 2010 ). Irrigation has
expanded and intensiﬁed rapidly over the twentieth cen-
tury, accelerating after 1950 with the increased exploitationof groundwater resources (Rodell et al. 2009 ; Scanlon et al.
2012 ; Wada et al. 2010 ), and the climate effects of irri-
gation have been broadly documented (e.g., in the reviewby Mahmood et al. 2013b ). In areas where evapotranspi-
ration rates are moisture limited, the addition of irrigation
water shifts the surface energy balance to favor latent oversensible heating, decreasing the Bowen ratio and reducing
soil and air temperatures (Kueppers et al. 2007 ; Sacks et al.
2009 ). This ﬁrst order effect has been documented pri-
marily in areas characterized by growing seasons with low
moisture availability and high atmospheric demand, such
as the Central Valley of California (Bonﬁls and Lobell
2007 ) and the southern Great Plains (Barnston and
Schickedanz 1984 ). Enhanced evapotranspiration from
irrigation can also increase atmospheric water vapor, withpotential consequences for the regional and global radiative
balance. For example, Boucher et al. ( 2004 ) found that
irrigation, when added to a GCM, acted as a net positiveradiative forcing due to the enhanced trapping of longwave
radiation from increased humidity, an effect that may be
enough to increase local minimum temperatures (Mah-mood et al. 2013a ). Alternatively, if increased evapo-
transpiration from irrigation also enhances cloud
formation, this may reduce the net solar forcing at the
surface or top of the atmosphere (TOA) by increasing
albedo and shortwave reﬂection. Finally, although large
uncertainties remain, there is evidence that irrigation mayeven enhance precipitation locally and downwind of major
irrigation regions (e.g., Barnston and Schickedanz 1984 ;
DeAngelis et al. 2010 ; Lo and Famiglietti 2013 ).
There is clear evidence that irrigation has important
local, regional, and possibly global effects on climate.
Despite this, irrigation is typically not included as ananthropogenic forcing in historical GCM simulations along
with land cover change, aerosols, GHGs, and other forc-
ings. Here, we conduct a new suite of historical GCM
experiments with the Goddard Institute for Space Studies
(GISS) atmosphere GCM, ModelE2 (Schmidt et al. 2014 ),coupled to the Russell ocean model (Russell et al. 1995 )
and using historically estimated irrigation rates from the
dataset of Wisser et al. ( 2010 ). Ours is the ﬁrst GCM study
of irrigation to quantify the importance of irrigation as aclimate forcing in the context of other natural and
anthropogenic forcings during the climate evolution of the
twentieth century, using the same framework as the forced
historical simulations from the Coupled Model Intercom-
parison Project version 5 (CMIP5, Taylor et al. 2012 ).
2 Data and methods
2.1 GISS ModelE2
All experiments are conducted with the coupled GCM
ModelE2-R (2
/C14/C22:5/C14latitude/longitude resolution),
which includes the latest version of the state-of-the-artGISS atmosphere general circulation model (ModelE2),
with updated physics for inclusion in the CMIP5 (Schmidt
et al. 2014 ), and the Russell (R) ocean model (Hansen et al.
2007 ; Russell et al. 1995 ). Historical simulations using
current (Miller et al. 2014 ) and previous (Hansen et al.
2007 ) versions of the model demonstrate the ability of
ModelE2 to realistically reproduce historical responses to
external climate forcings, including volcanic eruptions and
anthropogenic GHGs. For our experiments, we use theversion of model physics with non-interactive atmospheric
composition (referred to as NINT in Miller et al. 2014 ),
where concentrations of ozone and radiatively importantaerosols are prescribed according to observation based
decadal averages.
The irrigation module in ModelE2-R uses historically
varying, monthly irrigation rates from a 0 :5
/C14resolution
reconstruction of twentieth century global hydrography
(Wisser et al. 2010 ). Wisser et al. ( 2010 ) derive historical
irrigation rates from 1901 to 2002 using the University of
Frankfurt/FAO Global Maps of Irrigated Areas (Siebert
et al. 2005a ,b) (extended back to 1901 by Freydank and
Siebert 2008 ) and an ofﬂine model of terrestrial water
balance and transport (WBMplus; Federer et al. 2003 ;
Vo¨ro¨smarty et al. 1998 ). WBMplus includes explicit rep-
resentations of human activities that affect the water cycle:
irrigation (Wisser et al. 2008 ) and reservoir operation
(Wisser et al. 2010 ). For areas equipped for irrigation in
WBMplus, an irrigation water ﬂux is applied to the soil to
compensate for climate observation forced soil moisture
deﬁcits, including an explicit treatment for paddy rice
irrigation. In ModelE2-R, this new irrigation ﬂux of water,
calculated ofﬂine in WBMplus, is added to the top of the
vegetated fraction of the soil column, below the vegetationcanopy. Without a separate soil column for the irrigated
crop fraction, irrigation is applied to the total vegetatedB. I. Cook et al.
123fraction. The implications of this simpliﬁcation are
addressed in the discussion section of this paper. Previous
studies with the GISS model have used the irrigation
module to investigate irrigation impacts on climate during
the historical period (Puma and Cook 2010 ; Shukla et al.
2013 ) and under increased GHG forcing (Cook et al. 2011 ).
Because our model simulations for this study begin in
1850, we linearly extrapolated the model irrigation from
1901 back to 1850. Further details on the development of
the underlying irrigation dataset, and its implementation in
ModelE2-R, can be found in Wisser et al. ( 2010 ) and Puma
and Cook ( 2010 ), respectively.
Irrigation is concentrated in the major regions of agri-
cultural production in the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. 1). In
the early part of the century (1901–1920, Fig. 1a), most
irrigation occurs in Monsoon Asia, with secondary centers
in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and North America.By the end of the twentieth century (1981–2000, Fig. 1b),
irrigation rates intensify in these areas, and expand into
additional regions, such as Northern Europe and Central
Asia. Differences between the early and late twentieth
century irrigation maps reﬂect the steady increase in global
irrigation rates over the last 100 years (Fig. 2a), with a
notable acceleration after about 1950 that coincides with
the start of the green revolution and exploitation ofgroundwater resources. The vast majority of global irri-
gation is concentrated in Monsoon Asia (Fig. 2b), where
water intensive rice cultivation dominates the agricultural
landscape. In North America there is a notable jump at
1950, coinciding with the start of exploitation of theOgallala aquifer (Scanlon et al. 2012 ). Over the European
domain (Fig. 2d), irrigation increases over the course of the
twentieth century before plateauing in the 1980s.
2.2 Experiments
We conduct two 5-member ensemble experiments with
ModelE2-R from 1850–2000, with initial conditions taken
from a near-equilibrium pre-industrial control run withatmospheric composition and solar irradiance held ﬁxed at
1850 values. In experiment HIST, all forcings are identical
to those used in the standard ModelE2-R historical simu-lations submitted for the CMIP5 effort (Miller et al. 2014 ),
including solar and volcanic forcing, anthropogenic GHGs,
land cover, and tropospheric aerosols (natural and anthro-pogenic). In experiment HIST ?IRR we include, as an
additional forcing, transient historical irrigation rates, as
described previously. Differences between the two exper-
iments (HIST þIRR/C0HIST) are used to assess the cli-
matic impact of irrigation. Because we are interested in the

3 Results
3.1 Global average response
In both experiments, the historical evolution of net
radiation (Rnet) at the TOA follows the expected
increase from enhanced GHG forcing and trapping ofoutgoing longwave radiation (Fig. 3a). Large magnitude,
but short-lived, negative spikes in Rnet correspond to
volcanic eruptions and the associated negative aerosol
forcing. At the TOA, Rnet is about ?0:02 W m
/C02higher
in HIST ?IRR compared to HIST, similar to the mag-
nitude of irrigation forcing ( ?0:03 W m/C02) found in the
experiments of Boucher et al. ( 2004 ). Irrigation forcing
at the TOA in our experiments is insigniﬁcant
ðp[0:05Þ, however, suggesting that irrigation has a
negligible effect on the global TOA radiative balance. It
should be noted, though, that the standard radiative
forcing concept might be difﬁcult to apply to irrigationbecause of the temperature, energy balance, and water
vapor feedbacks inherent in the irrigation–climate
response (Boucher et al. 2004 ).
Irrigation has a cooling effect on global average

tion run, but this increase is only marginally signiﬁcant

Increasing irrigation rates over the twentieth century cause
signiﬁcant differences in regional temperature trends. BothHIST (Fig. 4a) and HIST ?IRR (Fig. 4b) show wide-
spread and signiﬁcant warming in annual average surface
air temperatures from 1971 to 2000 (insigniﬁcant differ-ences at p[0:05 in Fig. 4have been masked out). In
many areas with major irrigation expansion or intensiﬁca-
tion, however, these warming trends weaken (WesternNorth America), become insigniﬁcant (Europe), or, in
some cases, reverse to cooling trends (extra-tropical South
America, India).
The time when irrigation begins to signiﬁcantly affect
surface air temperature varies by region. In Central Asia
and China (Fig.
5a, b), temperatures in the two simulations1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000−1.5−1−0.500.511.5 W m−2Global Average Anomalies, Land+Ocean

warming up to the 1950s, followed by multi-decadal
cooling often ascribed to increased aerosol forcing (e.g., He
et al. 2013 ; Qian and Giorgi 2000 ). Despite the temperature
offset, both regions have similar temperature trends over
1971–2000. This contrasts sharply with India (Fig. 5c),
where irrigation rates are high enough across the wholecentury to lead to continuously cooler surface temperatures
in HIST ?IRR. Temperatures trends do diverge over
India, with increasing irrigation causing a slight cooling
trend over the last 30 years of the century. Late twentieth
century temperature trends are similar between the HIST
and HIST ?IRR simulations for the Mediterranean
(Fig. 5d), the Middle East (Fig. 5e), and Western North
America (Fig. 5f). Cooler average temperatures in HIS-
T?IRR manifest in the Mediterranean and Western North
America beginning in the 1970s and in the 1930s in the
Middle East.
3.3 Spatial response: 1981–2000
Irrigation effects on climate in the late twentieth century
(1981–2000) are highly localized, coinciding with landareas where irrigation is most intense. Irrigation causes
widespread cooling (Fig. 6a), primarily over Western
North America, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, India,
Indochina, Central Asia, and China. Localized cooling is
generally on the order of /C00:5t o/C01:0 K, with much more
intensive cooling over northern India, where the highest
irrigation rates in the model and irrigation dataset occur.Irrigation increases atmospheric moisture, primarily at low
levels, and this is reﬂected in the 850 hPa speciﬁc humidity
(Fig. 6b) and low level (surface to 680 hPa) cloud cover
(Fig. 6c). In concert with these humidity increases, pre-
cipitation is also enhanced (Fig. 6d), especially in Western
North America, the Middle East, and Central Asia. The
only major region where annual land precipitation signiﬁ-
cantly declines is in far eastern India, Bangladesh, andMyanmar in Monsoon Asia due to drying during the
summer monsoon.
Despite little impact on the globally averaged radiative
balance, irrigation has a large effect on regional radiative
ﬂuxes (Fig. 7). Signiﬁcant changes in net total radiation at
the surface (Fig. 7a) and TOA (Fig. 7b) occur primarily
over Monsoon and Central Asia. Over the Indian subcon-
tinent and Southeast Asia, net radiation increases, while

123over Central Asia and China net radiation decreases. Irri-
gation reduces net shortwave at TOA (Fig. 7c) and the
surface (Fig. 7d), especially over Western North America,
the Middle East, and Asia. These reductions coincide clo-sely with the increases in cloud cover (Fig. 6c), indicating
this change is through increased reﬂection by clouds.
Indeed, areas where net shortwave is actually increasing(e.g., northern India) are areas where cloud cover declines.
Irrigation increases net longwave ﬂuxes (Fig. 7e, f). In
ModelE2-R this occurs because the cooler soil tempera-
tures reduce outgoing longwave ﬂuxes; increased longwave
trapping from enhanced near surface humidity is small (notshown). Over North America, the longwave and shortwave
effects largely cancel, leading to negligible changes in net
radiation. In India, the enhanced longwave dominates,increasing net total radiation, while in Central Asia and
China, the shortwave reductions drive an overall decline in
energy availability.Irrigation has a much larger impact on surface energy
partitioning (sensible, Fig. 8a, and latent, Fig. 8b) than on
total energy availability in our experiments. In areas where
irrigation rates are high (Western North America, theMediterranean, Middle East, India), the addition of irriga-
tion water shifts the Bowen ratio to favor latent over sen-
sible heating, and these shifts coincide closely with muchof the surface cooling in Fig. 6a. Outside the main irriga-
tion regions, signiﬁcant increases in latent heating and
reductions in sensible heating are related to local increases
in precipitation (e.g., the Sahara; Fig. 6d). The dominance
of Bowen ratio versus energy balance shifts for the tem-perature response in our experiments contrasts sharply with
the irrigation study of Sacks et al. ( 2009 ). In their study,
Sacks et al found instead that the cooling response was
driven primarily by irrigation-induced increases in cloud
cover and reductions in surface shortwave radiation, rather
than by direct evaporative cooling.1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000−0.4−0.200.20.40.60.81

1233.4 Regional and seasonal effects
Highest irrigation rates occur in Asia, and this is where the
largest temperature and precipitation responses occur
(Fig. 9). In the relatively temperate mid-latitude regions of
China (Fig. 9, top row) and Central Asia (Fig. 9, middle
row), irrigation is highest during boreal summer, and it is
during the warm months that most of the signiﬁcant cool-
ing occurs (indicated by red stars, p/C200:05, two-sided
Student’s ttest). Irrigation signiﬁcantly enhances warm
season precipitation in June in China and during May,
June, August, and September in Central Asia. Irrigationrates are much higher over the region of India ?Bangla-
desh, with larger (and signiﬁcant) magnitude temperature
and precipitation anomalies in most months (Fig. 9, bottom
row). This is partly due to the more sub-tropical nature of
this region, characterized by relatively high evaporative
demand throughout the year and a pronounced dry season
during boreal winter. Most cooling in India ?Bangladesh
occurs during this dry season, but precipitation responses
are seasonally dependent. Precipitation increases are small,but signiﬁcant, during the dry season, and are likely linked
to increased evapotranspiration from irrigation during the
relatively warm dry season. During the main summermonsoon season, precipitation deﬁcits are large and con-
centrated in eastern India and Bangladesh. These changes
may be related to the tendency for irrigation to weaken the
summer monsoon circulation in this region (discussed in
detail in Shukla et al. 2013 ). An analysis of the surface
energy balance partitioning in these regions (Fig. 10)
indicates that the temperature changes are due primarily tochanges in the Bowen ratio, rather than total energy
availability. In China and India ?Bangladesh, signiﬁcant
changes in net radiation at the surface (Fig. 10, left col-
umn) are all positive, indicating the dominance of the
longwave effects, while in Central Asia increased short-
wave reﬂection causes a net reduction in surface energy.These changes in net energy availability, however, are
much smaller than the changes in latent (Fig. 10, center
column) and sensible (Fig. 10, right column) heat ﬂuxes.
Irrigation also has a large and signiﬁcant impact on
climate in the Mediterranean (Fig. 11, top row), Middle
East (Fig. 11, middle row), and Western North America
(Fig. 11, bottom row). These three regions are generally
characterized by warm summers with high evaporative
demand and, as with China and Central Asia, the warmseason is when the temperature (cooling) and precipitation
(enhanced) responses are largest. Notably, precipitationΔ2-m Air Temp (K)

East, but the shortwave and longwave effects cancel outover Western North America. As with Asia, shifts in latent
(Fig. 12, center column) and sensible (Fig. 12, right col-
umn) heat ﬂuxes are much larger than any changes in net
energy availability.
4 Discussion and conclusions
Human land use and land cover change is an important
anthropogenic climate forcing (Mahmood et al. 2013b ),
with regional impacts that may match or even exceed
localized responses to globally well-mixed anthropogenicGHG forcing (Pielke et al. 2011 ). But while the effects of
land cover change on historical and future climate have
been comprehensively assessed (e.g., Feddema et al. 2005 ;
Kumar et al. 2013 ; Pitman et al. 2009 ), only recently have
studies begun to analyze the response of the climate system
to second order land use effects (Luyssaert et al. 2014 ).
This includes cropland management (Lobell et al. 2006 ),
crop growth and development (Chen and Xie 2012 ), and
irrigation (Lobell et al. 2006 ; Sacks et al. 2009 ). In this
study, we use a new set of historically forced GCM
experiments to investigate the importance of irrigation as
an historical climate forcing.
Compared to other regionally important anthropogenic
forcings, such as land cover change (Boisier et al. 2012 )
or aerosols (e.g., Bellouin et al. 2013 ; Booth et al. 2012 ),
irrigation has relatively small effects on the total energy
availability at the surface or TOA for most areas. Sig-
niﬁcant perturbations to net total radiation are largelya b

(e.g., Central Asia and China at TOA) to þ10 (e.g., India
at the surface) W m/C02, depending on whether shortwave
or longwave effects dominate. Instead, irrigation has amuch larger and widespread inﬂuence on the surface
partitioning between sensible and latent heat ﬂuxes
(Fig. 8). It is these shifts in the Bowen ratio that cause
widespread regional cooling and enhancement of pre-
cipitation, with climate responses generally scaling with
the intensity of irrigation. The small impact of irrigationon net energy availability is perhaps not surprising, given
that the addition of irrigation does not directly add
substantial amounts of energy to the global earth system.Any changes in net radiation must then come from
secondary effects (e.g., cloud cover changes, increasedatmospheric water vapor, etc.) which, as noted, were
small at the global scale.
Contrary to observations (e.g., Jones et al. 2012 ),
warming trends in HIST ?IRR from 1971 to 2000 become
insigniﬁcant or actually reverse in Northern Europe and
India, suggesting that climate in ModelE2-R is overly
sensitive to irrigation, at least in certain regions. Thisoverestimation of irrigation effects on climate, and the
subsequent divergence between our GCM simulations and
observed warming trends, could occur for a variety ofreasons. First, the magnitude of climate responses to irri-
gation depends crucially on the evaporative regime, i.e. the
degree to which evapotranspiration rates are energy(demand) versus moisture (supply) limited (Cook et al.
2011 ; Puma and Cook 2010 ). The extent to which models

123can accurately simulate observed evaporative regimes,
however, is affected by numerous model dependent factors,
including precipitation biases and land surface parameter-izations (e.g., rooting depth, vegetation seasonality, etc.).
Ultimately, if model soils are too dry compared to the real
world, irrigation will have a larger effect on evapotrans-piration and the subsequent climate response will be
ampliﬁed. Relatedly, land–atmosphere coupling strengths
are known to vary widely across GCMs (Koster et al.2006 ). Second, models with lower resolution than theoriginal irrigation dataset ð0:5
/C14Þmay amplify irrigation–
climate responses (Puma and Cook 2010 ; Sacks et al.
2009 ). For this study, the underlying irrigation dataset was
aggregated to the coarser resolution ð2/C14/C22:5/C14Þof Mo-
delE2-R by summing all irrigation grid cells that would fall
within each coarser ModelE2-R grid cell. A single cell at
coarser resolution may then include both irrigated and non-
irrigated areas from the original irrigation dataset, even as
the whole cell is treated as irrigated in the model. This can
result in greater irrigated areas and potentially higher ChinaΔ2−m Air Temp (K) ΔPrecipitation (mm day  ) Irrigation (mm day  )

123evapotranspiration rates and climate responses. To improve
the realism of these responses, increases in spatial resolu-
tion of the model’s land and vegetation modules would
reduce overestimates of irrigated area. More directly,ModelE2-R should be modiﬁed to simulate the dynamics
of a separate soil column for irrigated crops within each
grid cell. These changes would lead (ideally) to improved
soil moisture and evapotranspiration dynamics for both
irrigated crops and other vegetation. Finally, there are stilllarge uncertainties in how irrigation interacts with other
anthropogenic forcings in GCMs. For example, anthopo-
genic aerosol forcing has important effects on the surfaceenergy balance in many regions, which may affect theevaporative regime and evapotranspiration rates (Naza-
renko and Menon 2005 ).
Where possible, we attempted to compare our results
with other irrigation studies, but a comprehensive com-parison was difﬁcult for multiple reasons. For example,
there is little standardization across modeling studies in
the experimental setup, amount of irrigation forcing
applied, and the model diagnostics reported. Analyses of
irrigation effects on climate would therefore clearlybeneﬁt from standardized multi-model intercomparisons,
similar to existing projects studying other land surface-
climate interactions, such as GLACE (Koster et al. 2006 ;
Seneviratne et al. 2013 ) and LUCID (Boisier et al. 2012 ;JFMAMJJASOND−12−10−8−6−4−20

123Pitman et al. 2009 ). For irrigation, these intercompari-
sons are becoming increasingly tractable as GCM groups
have begun integrating their own irrigation schemes,
including the Community Earth System Model (CESM,Levis and Sacks 2011 ) and Laboratoire de Me ´te´orologie
Dynamique (LMD-Z, Guimberteau et al. 2012 ). Ideally,
such an intercomparison would, at minimum, (1) stan-dardize the set of model diagnostics reported and ana-
lyzed (e.g., energy balance terms, temperature, etc.) and
(2) use a common dataset of irrigation forcing, such asthe WBMplus data set used here. Such a set of experi-
ments would be especially helpful for highlighting modelbased uncertainties in the irrigation–climate response
(e.g., model resolution, surface climate biases, etc.).
Additionally, given the broad evidence presented here,
and in other modeling and empirical studies, for a sig-niﬁcant impact of irrigation on climate, we believe that
irrigation should be included as another standard histor-
ical anthropogenic climate forcing in future multi-modelassessments, such as the CMIP6 (Meehl et al. 2014 ). The
importance of irrigation for historical (and future) cli-
mate can then be assessed in comparison to otherimportant anthropogenic forcings, such as aerosols, land
cover change, and GHGs.JFMAMJJASOND−0.2−0.100.10.20.3
