Cenozoic temperature, sea level and CO 2covariations
provide insights into climate sensitivity to external
forcings and sea-level sensitivity to climate change.
Climate sensitivity depends on the initial climate
state, but potentially can be accurately inferred
from precise palaeoclimate data. Pleistocene climateoscillations yield a fast-feedback climate sensitivity
of 3±1
◦Cf o ra4 W m−2CO 2forcing if Holocene
warming relative to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)is used as calibration, but the error (uncertainty) is
substantial and partly subjective because of poorly
deﬁned LGM global temperature and possible humaninﬂuences in the Holocene. Glacial-to-interglacial
climate change leading to the prior (Eemian) interglacial
is less ambiguous and implies a sensitivity in the
upper part of the above range, i.e. 3–4

CO 2forcing. Slow feedbacks, especially change of ice
sheet size and atmospheric CO 2, amplify the total
Earth system sensitivity by an amount that depends
on the time scale considered. Ice sheet response time
is poorly deﬁned, but we show that the slow response
and hysteresis in prevailing ice sheet models are
exaggerated. We use a global model, simpliﬁed toessential processes, to investigate state dependence
of climate sensitivity , ﬁnding an increased sensitivity
towards warmer climates, as low cloud cover is
diminished and increased water vapour elevates the
tropopause. Burning all fossil fuels, we conclude,
would make most of the planet uninhabitable byhumans, thus calling into question strategies that
emphasize adaptation to climate change.

Humanity is now the dominant force driving changes in the Earth’s atmospheric composition and
climate [ 1]. The largest climate forcing today , i.e. the greatest imposed perturbation of the planet’s
energy balance [ 1,2], is the human-made increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs),
especially CO 2from the burning of fossil fuels.
Earth’s response to climate forcings is slowed by the inertia of the global ocean and the great
ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica, which require centuries, millennia or longer to approach
their full response to a climate forcing. This long response time makes the task of avoiding
dangerous human alteration of climate particularly difﬁcult, because the human-made climateforcing is being imposed rapidly , with most of the current forcing having been added in just the
past several decades. Thus, observed climate changes are only a partial response to the current
climate forcing, with further response still ‘in the pipeline’ [ 3].
Climate models, numerical climate simulations, provide one way to estimate the climate
response to forcings, but it is difﬁcult to include realistically all real-world processes. Earth’s
palaeoclimate history allows empirical assessment of climate sensitivity , but the data have large
uncertainties. These approaches are usually not fully independent, and the most realistic eventual
assessments will be ones combining their greatest strengths.
We use the rich climate history of the Cenozoic era in the oxygen isotope record of ocean
sediments to explore the relation of climate change with sea level and atmospheric CO
2, inferring
climate sensitivity empirically . We use isotope data from Zachos et al. [4], which are improved
over data used in our earlier study [ 5], and we improve our prescription for separating the
effects of deep ocean temperature and ice volume in the oxygen isotope record as well as our
prescription for relating deep ocean temperature to surface air temperature. Finally , we use anefﬁcient climate model to expand our estimated climate sensitivities beyond the Cenozoic climate
range to snowball Earth and runaway greenhouse conditions.
2. OverviewofCenozoicclimateandouranalysisapproach
The Cenozoic era, the past 65.5 million years (Myr), provides a valuable perspective on climate
[5,6] and sea-level change [ 7], and Cenozoic data help clarify our analysis approach. The principal
dataset we use is the temporal variation of the oxygen isotope ratio ( δ18O relative to δ16O;ﬁgure 1 a
right-hand scale) in the shells of deep-ocean-dwelling microscopic shelled animals (foraminifera)in a near-global compilation of ocean sediment cores [ 4].δ
18O yields an estimate of the deep ocean
temperature ( ﬁgure 1 b), as discussed in §3. Note that coarse temporal resolution of δ18Od a t ai n
the intervals 7–17, 35–42 and 44–65 Myr reduces the apparent amplitude of glacial–interglacialclimate ﬂuctuations (see electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S1). We use additional proxy
measures of climate change to supplement the δ
18O data in our quantitative analyses.
Carbon dioxide is involved in climate change throughout the Cenozoic era, both as a climate
forcing and as a climate feedback. Long-term Cenozoic temperature trends, the warming up to
about 50 Myr before present (BP) and subsequent long-term cooling, are likely to be, at least in
large part, a result of the changing natural source of atmospheric CO 2, which is volcanic emissions
that occur mainly at continental margins due to plate tectonics (popularly ‘continental drift’);
tectonic activity also affects the weathering sink for CO 2by exposing fresh rock. The CO 2tectonic
source grew from 60 to 50 Myr BP as India subducted carbonate-rich ocean crust while moving
through the present Indian Ocean prior to its collision with Asia about 50 Myr BP [ 8], causing
atmospheric CO 2to reach levels of the order of 1000 ppm at 50 Myr BP [ 9]. Since then, atmospheric
CO 2declined as the Indian and Atlantic Oceans have been major depocentres for carbonate and
organic sediments while subduction of carbonate-rich crust has been limited mainly to small
regions near Indonesia and Central America [ 10], thus allowing CO 2to decline to levels as low
as 170 ppm during recent glacial periods [ 11]. A climate forcing due to a CO 2change from 1000
to 170 ppm is more than 10 W m−2, which compares with forcings of the order of 1 W m−2for on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 3rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................

competing climate forcings during the Cenozoic era [ 5], speciﬁcally long-term change of solar
irradiance and change of planetary albedo (reﬂectance) owing to the overall minor displacement
of continents in that era.
Superimposed on the long-term trends are occasional global warming spikes, ‘hyperthermals’,
most prominently the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) at approximately
56 Myr BP [ 12] and the Mid-Eocene Climatic Optimum at approximately 42 Myr BP [ 13],
coincident with large temporary increases of atmospheric CO 2. The most studied hyperthermal,
the PETM, caused global warming of at least 5◦C coincident with injection of a likely 4000–7000 Gt
of isotopically light carbon into the atmosphere and ocean [ 14]. The size of the carbon injection is
estimated from changes in the stable carbon isotope ratio13C/12C in sediments and from ocean
acidiﬁcation implied by changes in the ocean depth below which carbonate dissolution occurred.
The potential carbon source for hyperthermal warming that received most initial attention was
methane hydrates on continental shelves, which could be destabilized by sea ﬂoor warming [ 15].
Alternative sources include release of carbon from Antarctic permafrost and peat [ 16]. Regardless
of the carbon source(s), it has been shown that the hyperthermals were astronomically paced,spurred by coincident maxima in the Earth’s orbit eccentricity and spin axis tilt [ 17], which
increased high-latitude insolation and warming. The PETM was followed by successively weaker
astronomically paced hyperthermals, suggesting that the carbon source(s) partially recharged
in the interim [ 18]. A high temporal resolution sediment core from the New Jersey continental
shelf [ 19] reveals that PETM warming in at least that region began about 3000 years prior to a
massive release of isotopically light carbon. This lag and climate simulations [ 20] that produce on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 4rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................large warming at intermediate ocean depths in response to initial surface warming are consistent
with the concept of a methane hydrate role in hyperthermal events.
The hyperthermals conﬁrm understanding about the long recovery time of the Earth’s carbon
cycle [ 21] and reveal the potential for threshold or ‘tipping point’ behaviour with large amplifying
climate feedback in response to warming [ 22]. One implication is that if humans burn most of the
fossil fuels, thus injecting into the atmosphere an amount of CO 2at least comparable to that
injected during the PETM, the CO 2would stay in the surface carbon reservoirs (atmosphere,
ocean, soil, biosphere) for tens of thousands of years, long enough for the atmosphere, oceanand ice sheets to fully respond to the changed atmospheric composition. In addition, there is
the potential that global warming from fossil fuel CO
2could spur release of CH 4and CO 2
from methane hydrates or permafrost. Carbon release during the hyperthermals required several
thousand years, but that long injection time may have been a function of the pace of the
astronomical forcing, which is much slower than the pace of fossil fuel burning.
The Cenozoic record also reveals the ampliﬁcation of climate change that occurs with growth
or decay of ice sheets, as is apparent at about 34 Myr BP when the Earth became cool enough for
large-scale glaciation of Antarctica and in the most recent 3–5 Myr with the growth of Northern
Hemisphere ice sheets. Global climate ﬂuctuated in the 20 Myr following Antarctic glaciation withwarmth during the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO, 15 Myr BP) possibly comparable
to that at 34 Myr BP , as, for example, Germany became warm enough to harbour snakes and
crocodiles that require an annual temperature of about 20
◦C or higher and a winter temperature
more than 10◦C[ 23]. Antarctic vegetation in the MMCO implies a summer temperature of
approximately 11◦C warmer than today [ 24] and annual sea surface temperatures ranging from
0◦C to 11.5◦C[25].
Superimposed on the long-term trends, in addition to occasional hyperthermals, are continual
high-frequency temperature oscillations, which are apparent in ﬁgure 1 after 34 Myr BP , when
the Earth became cold enough for a large ice sheet to form on Antarctica, and are still more
prominent during ice sheet growth in the Northern Hemisphere. These climate oscillations have
dominant periodicities, ranging from about 20 to 400 kyr, that coincide with variations in theEarth’s orbital elements [ 26], speciﬁcally the tilt of the Earth’s spin axis, the eccentricity of the
orbit and the time of year when the Earth is closest to the Sun. The slowly changing orbit and tilt
of the spin axis affect the seasonal distribution of insolation [ 27], and thus the growth and decay
of ice sheets, as proposed by Milankovitch [ 28]. Atmospheric CO
2,C H 4and N 2O have varied
almost synchronously with global temperature during the past 800 000 years for which precise
data are available from ice cores, the GHGs providing an amplifying feedback that magniﬁes the
climate change instigated by orbit perturbations [ 29–31].
Ocean and atmosphere dynamical effects have been suggested as possible causes of some
climate change within the Cenozoic era; for example, topographical effects of mountain
building [ 32], closing of the Panama Seaway [ 33] or opening of the Drake Passage [ 34]. Climate
modelling studies with orographic changes conﬁrm signiﬁcant effects on monsoons and on
Eurasian temperature [ 35]. Modelling studies indicate that closing of the Panama Seaway
results in a more intense Atlantic thermohaline circulation, but only small effects on Northern
Hemisphere ice sheets [ 36]. Opening of the Drake Passage surely affected ocean circulation
around Antarctica, but efforts to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect on global temperature have relied on
speculation about possible effects on atmospheric CO 2[37]. Overall, there is no strong evidence
that dynamical effects are a major direct contributor to Cenozoic global temperature change.
We hypothesize that the global climate variations of the Cenozoic ( ﬁgure 1 ) can be understood
and analysed via slow temporal changes in Earth’s energy balance, which is a function of solar
irradiance, atmospheric composition (speciﬁcally long-lived GHGs) and planetary surface albedo.Using measured amounts of GHGs during the past 800 000 years of glacial–interglacial climate
oscillations and surface albedo inferred from sea-level data, we show that a single empirical ‘fast-
feedback’ climate sensitivity can account well for the global temperature change over that range
of climate states. It is certain that over a large climate range climate sensitivity must become a
strong function of the climate state, and thus we use a simpliﬁed climate model to investigate on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 5rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................the dependence of climate sensitivity on the climate state. Finally , we use our estimated state-
dependent climate sensitivity to infer Cenozoic CO 2change and compare this with proxy CO 2
data, focusing on the Eocene climatic optimum, the Oligocene glaciation, the Miocene optimumand the Pliocene.
3. DeepoceantemperatureandsealevelintheCenozoicera
Theδ18O stable isotope ratio was the ﬁrst palaeothermometer, proposed by Urey [ 38]a n d
developed especially by Emiliani [ 39]. There are now several alternative proxy measures of
ancient climate change, but the δ18Od a t a( ﬁgure 1 a)o fZ a c h o s et al. [4], a conglomerate of the
global ocean sediment cores, is well suited for our purpose as it covers the Cenozoic era withgood temporal resolution. There are large, even dominant, non-climatic causes of δ
18O changes
over hundreds of millions of years [ 40], but non-climatic change may be small in the past few
hundred million years [ 41] and is generally neglected in Cenozoic climate studies. The principal
difﬁculty in using the δ18O record to estimate global deep ocean temperature, in the absence of
non-climatic change, is that δ18O is affected by the global ice mass as well as the deep ocean
temperature.
We make a simple estimate of global sea-level change for the Cenozoic era using the near-
global δ18O compilation of Zachos et al. [4]. More elaborate and accurate approaches, including
use of models, will surely be devised, but comparison of our result with other approaches isinstructive regarding basic issues such as the vulnerability of today’s ice sheets to near-term global
warming and the magnitude of hysteresis effects in ice sheet growth and decay .
During the Early Cenozoic, between 65.5 and 35 Myr BP , the Earth was so warm that there was
little ice on the planet and the deep ocean temperature is approximated by [ 6]
T
do(◦C)=− 4δ18O+12 (for δ18O<1.75). (3.1)
Hansen et al. [5] made the approximation that, as the Earth became colder and continental ice
sheets grew, further increase in δ18O was due, in equal parts, to deep ocean temperature change
and ice mass change,
Tdo(◦C)=− 2(δ18O−4.25) (for δ18O>1.75). (3.2)
Equal division of the δ18O change into temperature change and ice volume change was suggested
by comparing δ18O at the endpoints of the climate change from the nearly ice-free planet at
35 Myr BP (when δ18O approx. 1.75) with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which peaked
approximately 20 kyr BP . The change of δ18O between these two extreme climate states (approx. 3)
is twice the change of δ18O due to temperature change alone (approx. 1.5), with the temperature
change based on the linear relation (3.1) and estimates of Tdo∼5◦Ca t3 5 M y r B P( ﬁgure 1 )a n d
approximately −1◦C at the LGM [ 42].
This approximation can easily be made more realistic. Although ice volume and deep ocean
temperature changes contributed comparable amounts to δ18O change on average over the full
range from 35 Myr to 20 kyr BP , the temperature change portion of the δ18O change must decrease
as the deep ocean temperature approaches the freezing point [ 43]. The rapid increase in δ18Oi n
the past few million years was associated with the appearance of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets,
symbolized by the dark blue bar in ﬁgure 1 a.
The sea-level change between the LGM and Holocene was approximately 120 m [ 44,45]. Thus,
two-thirds of the 180 m sea-level change between the ice-free planet and the LGM occurred
with formation of Northern Hemisphere ice (and probably some increased volume of Antarctic
ice). Thus, rather than taking the 180 m sea-level change between the nearly ice-free planet of34 Myr BP and the LGM as being linear over the entire range (with 90 m for δ
18O<3.25 and 90 m
forδ18O>3.25), it is more realistic to assign 60 m of sea-level change to δ18O 1.75–3.25 and 120 m
toδ18O>3.25. The total deep ocean temperature change of 6◦C for the change of δ18O from 1.75 on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 6rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................

Differences between our inferred sea-level chronology and that from the ice sheet model [ 46]
are relevant to the assessment of the potential danger to humanity from future sea-level rise.Our estimated sea levels have reached +5 to 10 m above the present sea level during recent
interglacial periods that were barely warmer than the Holocene, whereas the ice sheet model
yields maxima at most approximately 1 m above the current sea level. We ﬁnd the Pliocene sea
level varying between about +20 m and −50 m, with the Early Pliocene averaging about +15 m;
the ice sheet model has a less variable sea level with the Early Pliocene averaging about +8m .
A 15 m sea-level rise implies that the East Antarctic ice sheet as well as West Antarctica andGreenland ice were unstable at a global temperature no higher than those projected to occur this
century [ 1,48].
How can we interpret these differences, and what is the merit of our simple δ
18O scaling? Ice
sheet models constrained by multiple observations may eventually provide our best estimate of
sea-level change, but as yet models are primitive. Hansen [ 49,50] argues that real ice sheets are
more responsive to climate change than is found in most ice sheet models. Our simple scaling
approximation implicitly assumes that ice sheets are sufﬁciently responsive to climate change
that hysteresis is not a dominant effect; in other words, ice volume on millennial time scales isa function of temperature and does not depend much on whether the Earth is in a warming or
cooling phase. Thus, our simple transparent calculation may provide a useful comparison with
geological data for sea-level change and with results of ice sheet models.
We cannot ap r i o r i deﬁne accurately the error in our sea-level estimates, but we can compare
with geological data in speciﬁc cases as a check on reasonableness. Our results ( ﬁgure 2 ) yield two
instances in the past million years when sea levels have reached heights well above the currentsea level: +9.8 m in the Eemian (approx. 120 kyr BP , also known as Marine Isotope Stage 5e or
MIS-5e) and +7.1 m in the Holsteinian (approx. 400 kyr BP , also known as MIS-11). Indeed, these
are the two interglacial periods in the Late Pleistocene that traditional geological methods identify on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 8rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................as probably having a sea level exceeding that in the Holocene. Geological evidence, mainly coral
reefs on tectonically stable coasts, was described in the review of Overpeck et al. [51] as favouring
an Eemian maximum of +4 to more than 6 m. Rohling et al. [52] cite many studies concluding
that the mean sea level was 4–6 m above the current sea level during the warmest portion of the
Eemian, 123–119 kyr BP; note that several of these studies suggest Eemian sea-level ﬂuctuationsup to +10 m, and provide the ﬁrst continuous sea-level data supporting rapid Eemian sea-level
ﬂuctuations. Kopp et al. [53] made a statistical analysis of data from a large number of sites,
concluding that there was a 95% probability that the Eemian sea level reached at least +6.6 m
with a 67% probability that it exceeded 8 m.
The Holsteinian sea level is more difﬁcult to reconstruct from geological data because of its
age, and there has been a long-standing controversy concerning a substantial body of geologicalshoreline evidence for a +20 m Late Holsteinian sea level that Hearty and co-workers have found
on numerous sites [ 54,55] (numerous pros and cons are contained in the references provided in
our present paragraph). Rohling et al. [56] note that their temporally continuous Red Sea record
‘strongly supports the MIS-11 sea level review of Bowen [ 57], which also places MIS-11 sea
level within uncertainties at the present-day level’. This issue is important because both ice core
data [ 29] and ocean sediment core data (see below) indicate that the Holsteinian period was only
moderately warmer than the Holocene with similar Earth orbital parameters. We suggest that
the resolution of this issue is consistent with our estimate of the approximately +7 m Holsteinian
global sea level, and is provided by Raymo & Mitrovica [ 58], who pointed out the need to make
a glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) correction for post-glacial crustal subsidence at the places
where Hearty and others deduced local sea-level change. The uncertainties in GIA modelling ledRaymo & Mitrovica [ 58] to conclude that the peak Holsteinian global sea level was in the range
of +6 to 13 m relative to the present. Thus, it seems to us, there is a reasonable resolution of the
long-standing Holsteinian controversy , with substantial implications for humanity , as discussedin later sections.
We now address differences between our sea-level estimates and those from ice sheet models.
We refer to both the one-dimensional ice sheet modelling of de Boer et al. [46], which was used
to calculate sea level for the entire Cenozoic era, and the three-dimensional ice sheet model of
Bintanja et al. [59], which was used for simulations of the past million years. The differences
most relevant to humanity occur in the interglacial periods slightly warmer than the Holocene,including the Eemian and Hosteinian, as well as the Pliocene, which may have been as warm as
projected for later this century . Both the three-dimensional model of Bintanja et al. [59] and the
one-dimensional model of de Boer et al. [46] yield maximum Eemian and Hosteinian sea levels of
approximately 1 m relative to the Holocene. de Boer et al. [46] obtain approximately +8 m for the
Early Pliocene, which compares with our approximately +15 m.
These differences reveal that the modelled ice sheets are less susceptible to change in response
to global temperature variation than our δ
18O analysis. Yet the ice sheet models do a good job
of reproducing the sea-level change for climates colder than the Holocene, as shown in ﬁgure 2
and electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S2. One possibility is that the ice sheet models are
too lethargic for climates warmer than the Holocene. Hansen & Sato [ 60] point out the sudden
change in the responsiveness of the ice sheet model of Bintanja et al. [59] when the sea level reaches
today’s level (ﬁgs 3 and 4 of Hansen & Sato [ 60]) and they note that the empirical sea-level data
provide no evidence of such a sudden change. The explanation conceivably lies in the fact that
the models have many parameters and their operation includes use of ‘targets’ [ 46] that affect
the model results, because these choices might yield different results for warmer climates than
the results for colder climates. Because of the potential that model development choices might be
inﬂuenced by expectations of a ‘correct’ result, it is useful to have estimates independent of themodels based on alternative assumptions.
Note that our approach also involves ‘targets’ based on expected behaviour, albeit simple
transparent ones. Our two-legged linear approximation of the sea level (equations (3.3) and (3.4))
assumes that the sea level in the LGM was 120 m lower than today and that the sea level was 60 m
higher than today 35 Myr BP . This latter assumption may need to be adjusted if glaciers and ice on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 9rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................

caps in the Eocene had a volume of tens of metres of sea level. However, Miller et al. [61] conclude
that there was a sea level fall of approximately 55 m at the Eocene–Oligocene transition, consistent
with our assumption that Eocene ice probably did not contain more than approximately 10 m of
sea level.
Real-world data for the Earth’s sea-level history ultimately must provide assessment of sea-
level sensitivity to climate change. A recent comprehensive review [ 7] reveals that there are still
wide uncertainties about the Earth’s sea-level history that are especially large for time scales of
tens of millions of years or longer, which is long enough for substantial changes in the shape
and volume of ocean basins. Gasson et al. [7] plot regional (New Jersey) sea level (their ﬁg. 14)
against the deep ocean temperature inferred from the magnesium/calcium ratio (Mg/Ca) of
deep ocean foraminifera [ 62], ﬁnding evidence for a nonlinear sea-level response to temperature
roughly consistent with the modelling of de Boer et al. [46]. Sea-level change is limited for
Mg/Ca temperatures up to about 5◦C above current values, whereupon a rather abrupt sea-
level rise of several tens of metres occurs, presumably representing the loss of Antarctic ice.
However, the uncertainty in the reconstructed sea level is tens of metres and the uncertainty in
the Mg/Ca temperature is sufﬁcient to encompass the result from our δ18Op r e s c r i p t i o n ,w h i c h

Late Eocene glaciation of Antarctica. on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 10rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................Furthermore, the potential sea-level rise of most practical importance is the ﬁrst 15 m above
the Holocene level. It is such ‘moderate’ sea-level change for which we particularly question
the projections implied by current ice sheet models. Empirical assessment depends upon real-
world sea-level data in periods warmer than the Holocene. There is strong evidence, discussed
above, that the sea level was several metres higher in recent warm interglacial periods, consistentwith our data interpretation. The Pliocene provides data extension to still warmer climates. Our
interpretation of δ
18O data suggests that Early Pliocene sea-level change (due to ice volume
change) reached about +15 m, and it also indicates sea-level ﬂuctuations as large as 20–40 m.
Sea-level data for Mid-Pliocene warm periods, of comparable warmth to average Early Pliocene
conditions ( ﬁgure 3 ), suggest sea heights as great as +15–25 m [ 63,64]. Miller et al. [61]ﬁ n da
Pliocene sea-level maximum of 22 ±10 m (95% conﬁdence). GIA creates uncertainty in sea-level
reconstructions based on shoreline geological data [ 65], which could be reduced via appropriately
distributed ﬁeld studies. Dwyer & Chandler [ 64] separate Pliocene ice volume and temperature
in deep ocean δ18O via ostracode Mg/Ca temperatures, ﬁnding sea-level maxima and oscillations
comparable to our results. Altogether, the empirical data provide strong evidence against the
lethargy and strong hysteresis effects of at least some ice sheet models.
4. Surfaceairtemperaturechange
The temperature of most interest to humanity is the surface air temperature. A record of pastglobal surface temperature is required for empirical inference of global climate sensitivity . Given
that climate sensitivity can depend on the initial climate state and on the magnitude and sign
of the climate forcing, a continuous record of global temperature over a wide range of climate
states would be especially useful. Because of the singularly rich climate story in Cenozoic deep
ocean δ
18O(ﬁgure 1 ), unrivalled in detail and self-consistency by alternative climate proxies, we
use deep ocean δ18O to provide the ﬁne structure of Cenozoic temperature change. We use surface
temperature proxies from the LGM, the Pliocene and the Eocene to calibrate and check the relationbetween deep ocean and surface temperature change.
The temperature signal in deep ocean δ
18O refers to the sea surface where cold dense water
formed and sank to the ocean bottom, the principal location of deep water formation being theSouthern Ocean. Empirical data and climate models concur that surface temperature change is
generally ampliﬁed at high latitudes, which tends to make temperature change at the site of
deep water formation an overestimate of global temperature change. Empirical data and climatemodels also concur that surface temperature change is ampliﬁed over land areas, which tends to
make temperature change at the site of deep water an underestimate of the global temperature.
Hansen et al. [5] and Hansen & Sato [ 60] noted that these two factors were substantially offsetting,
and thus they made the assumption that benthic foraminifera provide a good approximation of
global mean temperature change for most of the Cenozoic era.
However, this approximation breaks down in the Late Cenozoic for two reasons. First, the deep
ocean and high-latitude surface ocean where deep water forms are approaching the freezing point
in the Late Cenozoic. As the Earth’s surface cools further, cold conditions spread to lower latitudes
but polar surface water and the deep ocean cannot become much colder, and thus the benthic
foraminifera record a temperature change smaller than the global average surface temperature
change [ 43]. Second, the last 5.33 Myr of the Cenozoic, the Pliocene and Pleistocene, was the
time that global cooling reached a degree such that large ice sheets could form in the Northern
Hemisphere. When a climate forcing, or a slow climate feedback such as ice sheet formation,
occurs in one hemisphere, the temperature change is much larger in the hemisphere with the
forcing (cf. examples in Hansen et al. [66]). Thus, cooling during the last 5.33 Myr in the Southern
Ocean site of deep water formation was smaller than the global average cooling.
We especially want our global surface temperature reconstruction to be accurate for the
Pliocene and Pleistocene because the global temperature changes that are expected by the
end of this century , if humanity continues to rapidly change atmospheric composition, are
of a magnitude comparable to climate change in those epochs [ 1,48]. Fortunately , sufﬁcient on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 11rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................information is available on surface temperature change in the Pliocene and Pleistocene to allow us
to scale the deep ocean temperature change by appropriate factors, thus retaining the temporal
variations in the δ18O while also having a realistic magnitude for the total temperature change
over these epochs.
Pliocene temperature is known quite well because of a long-term effort to reconstruct the
climate conditions during the Mid-Pliocene warm period (3.29–2.97 Myr BP) and a coordinated
effort to numerically simulate the climate by many modelling groups ([ 67] and papers referenced
therein). The reconstructed Pliocene climate used data for the warmest conditions found inthe Mid-Pliocene period, which would be similar to average conditions in the Early Pliocene
(ﬁgure 3 ). These boundary conditions were used by eight modelling groups to simulate Pliocene
climate with atmospheric general circulation models. Although atmosphere–ocean models havedifﬁculty replicating Pliocene climate, atmospheric models forced by speciﬁed surface boundary
conditions are expected to be capable of calculating global surface temperature with reasonable
accuracy . The eight global models yield Pliocene global warming of 3 ±1
◦C relative to the
Holocene [ 68]. This Pliocene warming is an ampliﬁcation by a factor of 2.5 of the deep ocean
temperature change.
Similarly , for the reasons given above, the deep ocean temperature change of 2.25◦C between
the Holocene and the LGM is surely an underestimate of the surface air temperature change.
Unfortunately , there is a wide range of estimates for LGM cooling, approximately 3–6◦C, as
discussed in §6. Thus, we take 4.5◦C as our best estimate for LGM cooling, implying an
ampliﬁcation of surface temperature change by a factor of two relative to deep ocean temperature
change for this climate interval.
We obtain an absolute temperature scale using the Jones et al. [69]e s t i m a t eo f1 4◦C as the
global mean surface temperature for 1961–1990, which corresponds to approximately 13.9◦Cf o r
the 1951–1980 base period that we normally use [ 70] and approximately 14.4◦C for the ﬁrst decade
of the twenty-ﬁrst century . We attach the instrumental temperature record to the palaeo data by
assuming that the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century exceeds the Holocene mean by 0.25 ±
0.25◦C. Global temperature probably declined over the past several millennia [ 71], but we suggest
that warming of the past century has brought global temperature to a level that now slightly
exceeds the Holocene mean, judging from sea-level trends and ice sheet mass loss. Sea level is
now rising 3.1 mm per year or 3.1 m per millennium [ 72], an order of magnitude faster than the
rate during the past several thousand years, and Greenland and Antarctica are losing mass at
accelerating rates [ 73,74]. Our assumption that global temperature passed the Holocene mean
a few decades ago is consistent with the rapid change of ice sheet mass balance in the past fewdecades [ 75]. The above concatenation of instrumental and palaeo records yields a Holocene mean
of 14.15
◦C and Holocene maximum (from ﬁve-point smoothed δ18O) of 14.3◦C at 8.6 kyr BP .
Given a Holocene temperature of 14.15◦C and LGM cooling of 4.5◦C, the Early Pliocene mean
temperature 3◦C warmer than the Holocene leads to the following prescription:
Ts(◦C)=2×Tdo+12.25◦C (Pleistocene) (4.1)
and
Ts(◦C)=2.5×Tdo+12.15◦C (Pliocene). (4.2)
This prescription yields a maximum Eemian temperature of 15.56◦C, which is approximately
1.4◦C warmer than the Holocene mean and approximately 1.8◦C warmer than the 1880–1920
mean. Clark & Huybers [ 76] ﬁt a polynomial to proxy temperatures for the Eemian, ﬁnding
warming as much as +5◦C at high northern latitudes but global warming of +1.7◦C ‘relative
to the present interglacial before industrialization’. Other analyses of Eemian data ﬁnd global sea
surface temperature warmer than the Late Holocene by 0.7 ±0.6◦C[77] and all-surface warming
of 2◦C[78], all in reasonable accord with our prescription.
Our ﬁrst estimate of global temperature for the remainder of the Cenozoic assumes that
/Delta1Ts=/Delta1Tdoprior to 5.33 Myr BP , i.e. prior to the Plio-Pleistocene, which yields a peak Tsof
approximately 28◦Ca t5 0 M y r B P( ﬁgure 4 ).

(EECO) [ 79–81]. Climate models are marginally able to reproduce this level of Eocene warmth,
but the models require extraordinarily high CO 2levels, for example 2240–4480 ppm [ 82]a n d
2500–6500 ppm [ 83], and the quasi-agreement between data and models requires an assumption
that some of the proxy temperatures are biased towards summer values. Moreover, taking theproxy sea surface temperature data for the peak Eocene period (55–48 Myr BP) at face value yields
a global temperature of 33–34
◦C (ﬁg. 3 of Bijl et al. [84]), which would require an even larger
CO 2amount with the same climate models. Thus, below we also consider the implications for
climate sensitivity of an assumption that /Delta1Ts=1.5×/Delta1Tdoprior to 5.33 Myr BP , which yields Ts
approximately 33◦C at 50 Myr BP (see electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S3).
5. Climatesensitivity
Climate sensitivity ( S) is the equilibrium global surface temperature change ( /Delta1Teq)i nr e s p o n s et o
a speciﬁed unit forcing after the planet has come back to energy balance,
S=/Delta1Teq
F, (5.1)
i.e. climate sensitivity is the eventual (equilibrium) global temperature change per unit forcing.
Climate sensitivity depends upon climate feedbacks, the many physical processes that come into
play as climate changes in response to a forcing. Positive (amplifying) feedbacks increase the
climate response, whereas negative (diminishing) feedbacks reduce the response.
We usually discuss climate sensitivity in terms of a global mean temperature response to a
4Wm−2CO 2forcing. One merit of this standard forcing is that its magnitude is similar to an
anticipated near-term human-made climate forcing, thus avoiding the need to continually scale
the unit sensitivity to achieve an applicable magnitude. A second merit is that the efﬁcacy of
forcings varies from one forcing mechanism to another [ 66]; so it is useful to use the forcing
mechanism of greatest interest. Finally , the 4 W m−2CO 2forcing avoids the uncertainty in the
exact magnitude of a doubled CO 2forcing [ 1,48] estimate of 3.7 W m−2for doubled CO 2,w h e r e a s
Hansen et al. [66] obtain 4.1 W m−2, as well as problems associated with the fact that a doubled
CO 2forcing varies as the CO 2amount changes (the assumption that each CO 2doubling has the
same forcing is meant to approximate the effect of CO 2absorption line saturation, but actually
the forcing per doubling increases as CO 2increases [ 66,85]).
Climate feedbacks are the core of the climate problem. Climate feedbacks can be confusing,
because in climate analyses what is sometimes a climate forcing is at other times a climate
feedback. A CO 2decrease from, say , approximately 1000 ppm in the Early Cenozoic to 170–
300 ppm in the Pleistocene, caused by shifting plate tectonics, is a climate forcing, a perturbation
of the Earth’s energy balance that alters the temperature. Glacial–interglacial oscillations of the
CO 2amount and ice sheet size are both slow climate feedbacks, because glacial–interglacial
climate oscillations largely are instigated by insolation changes as the Earth’s orbit and tilt of
its spin axis change, with the climate change then ampliﬁed by a nearly coincident change of
the CO 2amount and the surface albedo. However, for the sake of analysis, we can also choose
and compare periods that are in quasi-equilibrium, periods during which there was little changeof the ice sheet size or the GHG amount. For example, we can compare conditions averaged
over several millennia in the LGM with mean Holocene conditions. The Earth’s average energy
imbalance within each of these periods had to be a small fraction of 1 W m
−2. Such a planetary
energy imbalance is very small compared with the boundary condition ‘forcings’, such as changed
GHG amount and changed surface albedo that maintain the glacial-to-interglacial climate change.
(a) Fast-feedbacksensitivity:LastGlacialMaximum–Holocene
The average fast-feedback climate sensitivity over the LGM–Holocene range of climate states
can be assessed by comparing estimated global temperature change and climate forcing change on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 13rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................between those two climate states [ 3,86]. The appropriate climate forcings are the changes in long-
lived GHGs and surface properties on the planet. Fast feedbacks include water vapour, clouds,
aerosols and sea ice changes.
This fast-feedback sensitivity is relevant to estimating the climate impact of human-made
climate forcings, because the size of ice sheets is not expected to change signiﬁcantly in decadesor even in a century and GHGs can be speciﬁed as a forcing. GHGs change in response to climate
change, but it is common to include these feedbacks as part of the climate forcing by using
observed GHG changes for the past and calculated GHGs for the future, with calculated amounts
based on carbon cycle and atmospheric chemistry models.
Climate forcings due to past changes in GHGs and surface albedo can be computed for the
past 800 000 years using data from polar ice cores and ocean sediment cores. We use CO
2[87]a n d
CH 4[88] data from Antarctic ice cores ( ﬁgure 5 a) to calculate an effective GHG forcing as follows:
Fe(GHGs) =1.12[Fa(CO 2)+1.4Fa(CH 4)], (5.2)
where Fa is the adjusted forcing, i.e. the planetary energy imbalance due to the GHG change
after the stratospheric temperature has time to adjust to the gas change. Fe, the effective forcing,
accounts for variable efﬁcacies of different climate forcings [ 66]. Formulae for Fa of each gas are
given by Hansen et al. [89]. The factor 1.4 converts the adjusted forcing of CH 4to its effective
forcing, Fe, which is greater than Fa mainly because of the effect of CH 4on the tropospheric ozone
and the stratospheric water vapour [ 66]. The factor 1.12 approximates the forcing by N 2O changes,
which are not as well preserved in the ice cores but have a strong positive correlation with CO 2
and CH 4changes [ 90]. The factor 1.12 is smaller than the 1.15 used by Hansen et al. [91], and is
consistent with estimates of the N 2O forcing in the current Goddard Institute for Space Studies
(GISS) radiation code and that of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [ 1,48].
Our LGM–Holocene GHG forcing ( ﬁgure 5 c) is approximately 3 m−2, moderately larger than the
2.8 W m−2estimated by IPCC [ 1,48] because of our larger effective CH 4forcing.
Climate forcing due to surface albedo change is a function mainly of the sea level, which
implicitly deﬁnes ice sheet size. Albedo change due to LGM–Holocene vegetation change, much
of which is inherent with ice sheet area change, and albedo change due to coastline movement
are lumped together with ice sheet area change in calculating the surface albedo climate forcing.
An ice sheet forcing does not depend sensitively on the ice sheet shape or on how many ice
sheets the ice volume is divided among and is nearly linear in sea-level change (see electronicsupplementary material, ﬁgure S4, and [ 5]). For the sake of simplicity , we use the linear relation
in Hansen et al. [5] and electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S4; thus, 5 W m
−2between the
LGM and ice-free conditions and 3.4 W m−2between the LGM and Holocene. This scale factor
was based on simulations with an early climate model [ 3,92]; comparable forcings are found in
other models (e.g. see discussion in [ 93]), but results depend on cloud representations, assumed
ice albedo and other factors; so the uncertainty is difﬁcult to quantify . We subjectively estimate an
uncertainty of approximately 20%.
Global temperature change obtained by multiplying the sum of the two climate forcings in
ﬁgure 5 cby a sensitivity of 3 /4◦Cp e rW m−2yields a remarkably good ﬁt to ‘observations’
(ﬁgure 6 ), where the observed temperature is 2 ×/Delta1Tdo, with 2 being the scale factor required to
yield the estimated 4.5◦C LGM–Holocene surface temperature change. The close match is partly
a result of the fact that sea-level and temperature data are derived from the same deep ocean
record, but use of other sea-level reconstructions still yields a good ﬁt between the calculated and
observed temperature [ 5]. However, exactly the same match as in ﬁgure 6 is achieved with a fast-
feedback sensitivity of 1◦Cp e rWm−2if the LGM cooling is 6◦C or with a sensitivity of 0.5◦Cp e r
Wm−2if the LGM cooling is 3◦C.
Accurate data deﬁning LGM–Holocene warming would aid empirical evaluation of fast-
feedback climate sensitivity . Remarkably , the range of recent estimates of LGM–Holocene
warming, from approximately 3◦C[94] to approximately 6◦C[95], is about the same as at the time
of the CLIMAP [ 96] project. Given today’s much improved analytic capabilities, a new project to on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 14rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................

Mapping (PRISM) Pliocene data reconstruction [ 97,98] and Pliocene Model Intercomparison
Project (PlioMIP) model intercomparisons [ 67,68], could be beneﬁcial. In §7 b, we suggest that
a study of Eemian glacial–interglacial climate change could be even more deﬁnitive. Combined
LGM, Eemian and Pliocene studies would address an issue raised at a recent workshop [ 99]:
the need to evaluate how climate sensitivity varies as a function of the initial climate state. The
calculations below were initiated after the workshop as another way to address that question. on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 15rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................(b) Fast-feedbacksensitivity:statedependence
Climate sensitivity must be a strong function of the climate state. Simple climate models show
that, when the Earth becomes cold enough for the ice cover to approach the tropics, the amplifying
albedo feedback causes rapid ice growth to the Equator: ‘snowball Earth’ conditions [ 100 ]. Real-
world complexity , including ocean dynamics, can mute this sharp bifurcation to a temporarilystable state [ 101 ], but snowball events have occurred several times in the Earth’s history when
the younger Sun was dimmer than today [ 102 ]. The Earth escaped snowball conditions owing to
limited weathering in that state, which allowed volcanic CO
2to accumulate in the atmosphere
until there was enough CO 2for the high sensitivity to cause rapid deglaciation [ 103 ].
Climate sensitivity at the other extreme, as the Earth becomes hotter, is also driven
mainly by an H 2O feedback. As climate forcing and temperature increase, the amount of
water vapour in the air increases and clouds may change. Increased water vapour makes
the atmosphere more opaque in the infrared region that radiates the Earth’s heat to space,
causing the radiation to emerge from higher colder layers, thus reducing the energy emitted to
space. This amplifying feedback has been known for centuries and was described remarkably
well by Tyndall [ 104 ]. Ingersoll [ 105 ] discussed the role of water vapours in the ‘runaway
greenhouse effect’ that caused the surface of V enus to eventually become so hot that carbon
was ‘baked’ from the planet’s crust, creating a hothouse climate with almost 100 bars of
CO 2in the air and a surface temperature of about 450◦C, a stable state from which there
is no escape. Arrival at this terminal state required passing through a ‘moist greenhouse’
state in which surface water evaporates, water vapour becomes a major constituent of the
atmosphere and H 2O is dissociated in the upper atmosphere with the hydrogen slowly escaping
to space [ 106 ]. That V enus had a primordial ocean, with most of the water subsequently
lost to space, is conﬁrmed by the present enrichment of deuterium over ordinary hydrogen
by a factor of 100 [ 107 ], the heavier deuterium being less efﬁcient in escaping gravity
to space.
The physics that must be included to investigate the moist greenhouse is principally: (i)
accurate radiation incorporating the spectral variation of gaseous absorption in both the solarradiation and thermal emission spectral regions, (ii) atmospheric dynamics and convection with
no speciﬁcations favouring artiﬁcial atmospheric boundaries, such as between a troposphere
and stratosphere, (iii) realistic water vapour physics, including its effect on atmospheric massand surface pressure, and (iv) cloud properties that respond realistically to climate change.
Conventional global climate models are inappropriate, as they contain too much other detail
in the form of parametrizations or approximations that break down as climate conditions
become extreme.
We use the simpliﬁed atmosphere–ocean model of Russell et al. [108 ], which solves the same
fundamental equations (conservation of energy , momentum, mass and water substance, and the
ideal gas law) as in more elaborate global models. Principal changes in the physics in the current
version of the model are use of a step-mountain C-grid atmospheric vertical coordinate [ 109 ],
addition of a drag in the grid-scale momentum equation in both atmosphere and ocean based on
subgrid topography variations, and inclusion of realistic ocean tides based on exact positioning
of the Moon and Sun. Radiation is the k-distribution method of Lacis & Oinas [ 110 ] with
25k-values; the sensitivity of this speciﬁc radiation code is documented in detail by Hansen
et al. [111 ]. Atmosphere and ocean dynamics are calculated on 3
◦×4◦Arakawa C-grids. There
are 24 atmospheric layers. In our present simulations, the ocean’s depth is reduced to 100 mwith ﬁve layers so as to achieve a rapid equilibrium response to forcings; this depth limitation
reduces poleward ocean transport by more than half. Moist convection is based on a test of
moist static stability as in Hansen et al. [92]. Two cloud types occur: moist convective clouds,
when the atmosphere is moist statically unstable, and large-scale super-saturation, with cloud
optical properties based on the amount of moisture removed to eliminate super-saturation, with
scaling coefﬁcients chosen to optimize the control run’s ﬁt with global observations [ 108 ,112 ]. To
avoid long response times in extreme climates, today’s ice sheets are assigned surface properties on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 16rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................

darker vegetation in warm climates. The model, the present experiments and more extensive
experiments will be described in a forthcoming paper [ 112 ].
The equilibrium response of the control run (1950 atmospheric composition, CO 2approx.
310 ppm) and runs with successive CO 2doublings and halvings reveals that snowball Earth
instability occurs just beyond three CO 2halvings. Given that a CO 2doubling or halving is
equivalent to a 2% change in solar irradiance [ 66] and the estimate that solar irradiance was
approximately 6% lower 600 Ma at the most recent snowball Earth occurrence [ 113 ],ﬁgure 7
implies that about 300 ppm CO 2or less was sufﬁciently small to initiate glaciation at that time.
Climate sensitivity reaches large values at 8–32 ×CO 2(approx. 2500–10 000 ppm; ﬁgure 7 b).
High sensitivity is caused by increasing water vapour as the tropopause rises and diminishinglow cloud cover, but the sensitivity decreases for still larger CO
2as cloud optical thickness and
planetary albedo increase, as shown by Russell et al. [112 ]. The high sensitivity for CO 2less than
4×CO 2is due partly to the nature of the experiments (Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets being
replaced by the tundra). High albedo snow cover on these continents largely disappears between
1×CO 2and 4 ×CO 2, thus elevating the calculated fast-feedback sensitivity from approximately
4◦C to approximately 5◦C. In the real world, we would expect the Greenland and Antarctic ice
sheets to be nearly eliminated and replaced by partially vegetated surfaces already at 2 ×CO 2
(620 ppm) equilibrium climate. In other words, if the Greenland/Antarctic surface albedo change
were identiﬁed as a slow feedback, rather than as a fast-feedback snow effect as it is in ﬁgure 7 ,
the fast-feedback sensitivity at 1–4 ×CO 2would be approximately 4◦C. Thus, the sensitivity
approximately 8◦Cp e rC O 2doubling in the range of 8–32 ×CO 2is a very large increase over
sensitivity at smaller CO 2amounts.
How conﬁdent are we in the modelled fast-feedback sensitivity ( ﬁgure 7 b)? We suspect that
the modelled water vapour feedback may be moderately exaggerated, because the water vapour
amount in the control run exceeds observed amounts. In addition, the area of sea ice in the control
run exceeds observations, which may increase the modelled sensitivity in the 1–4 ×CO 2range.
On the other hand, we probably underestimate the sensitivity at very high CO 2amounts, because
our model (such as most climate models) does not change the total atmospheric mass as the CO 2
amount varies. Mass change due to conceivable fossil fuel loading (up to say 16 ×CO 2) is unlikely
to have much effect, but sensitivity is probably underestimated at high CO 2amounts owing to on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 17rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................self-broadening of CO 2absorption lines. The increased atmospheric mass is also likely to alter the
cloud feedback, which otherwise is a strongly diminishing feedback at very large CO 2amounts.
Atmospheric mass will be important after the Earth has lost its ocean and carbon is baked into
the atmosphere. These issues are being examined by Russell et al. [112 ].
Earth today , with approximately 1.26 times 1950 CO 2, is far removed from the snowball
state. Because of the increase in solar irradiance over the past 600 Myr and volcanic emissions,
no feasible CO 2amount could take the Earth back to snowball conditions. Similarly , a V enus-
like baked-crust CO 2hothouse is far distant because it cannot occur until the ocean escapes
to space. We calculate an escape time of the order of 108–109years even with the increased
stratospheric water vapour and temperature at 16 ×CO 2. Given the transient nature of a fossil
fuel CO 2injection, the continuing forcing required to achieve a terminal V enus-like baked-crust
CO 2hothouse must wait until the Sun’s brightness has increased on the billion year time scale.
However, the planet could become uninhabitable long before that.
The practical concern for humanity is the high climate sensitivity and the eventual climate
response that may be reached if all fossil fuels are burned. Estimates of the carbon content of all
fossil fuel reservoirs including unconventional fossil fuels such as tar sands, tar shale and various
gas reservoirs that can be tapped with developing technology [ 114 ] imply that CO 2conceivably
could reach a level as high as 16 times the 1950 atmospheric amount. In that event, ﬁgure 7
suggests a global mean warming approaching 25◦C, with much larger warming at high latitudes
(see electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S6). The result would be a planet on which humans
could work and survive outdoors in the summer only in mountainous regions [ 115 ,116 ]—and
there they would need to contend with the fact that a moist stratosphere would have destroyed
the ozone layer [ 117 ].
6. Earthsystemsensitivity
GHG and surface albedo changes, which we treated as speciﬁed climate forcings in evaluating
fast-feedback climate sensitivity , are actually slow climate feedbacks during orbit-instigated
Pleistocene glacial–interglacial climate swings. Given that GHG and albedo feedbacks are both
strong amplifying feedbacks, indeed accounting by themselves for most of the global Pleistocene
climate variation, it is apparent that today’s climate sensitivity on millennial time scales must be
substantially larger than the fast-feedback sensitivity .
Climate sensitivity including slow feedbacks is described as ‘Earth system sensitivity’ [ 118 –
120 ]. There are alternative choices for the feedbacks included in Earth system sensitivity .
Hansen & Sato [ 60] suggest adding slow feedbacks one by one, creating a series of increasingly
comprehensive Earth system climate sensitivities; speciﬁcally , they successively move climate-driven changes in surface albedo, non-CO
2GHGs and CO 2into the feedback category , at which
point the Earth system sensitivity is relevant to an external forcing such as changing solar
irradiance or human-made forcings. At each level, in this series, the sensitivity is state dependent.
Our principal aim here is to use Cenozoic climate change to infer information on the all-
important fast-feedback climate sensitivity , including its state dependence, via analysis of Earth
system sensitivity . CO 2is clearly the dominant forcing of the long-term Cenozoic cooling, in
view of the abundant evidence that CO 2reached levels of the order of 1000 ppm in the Early
Cenozoic [ 9], as discussed in the Overview above. Thus, our approach is to examine Earth system
sensitivity to CO 2change by calculating the CO 2history required to produce our reconstructed
Cenozoic temperature history for alternative state-independent and state-dependent climate
sensitivities. By comparing the resulting CO 2histories with CO 2proxy data, we thus assess the
most realistic range for climate sensitivity .
Two principal uncertainties in this analysis are (i) global temperature at the EECO
approximately 50 Myr BP and (ii) CO 2amount at that time. We use EECO approximately 28◦C
(ﬁgure 4 ) as our standard case, but we repeat the analysis with EECO approximately 33◦C( s e e
electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S3), thus allowing inference of how the conclusions
change if knowledge of Eocene temperature changes. on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 18rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................Similarly , our graphs allow the inferred climate sensitivity to be adjusted if improved
knowledge of CO 250 Myr BP indicates a value signiﬁcantly different from approximately
1000 ppm.
To clarify our calculations, let us ﬁrst assume that fast-feedback climate sensitivity is a constant
(state-independent) 3◦C for doubled CO 2(0.75◦Cp e rW m−2). It is then trivial to convert our
global temperature for the Cenozoic ( ﬁgure 4 a) to the total climate forcing throughout the
Cenozoic, which is shown in the electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S4 a, as are results
of subsequent steps. Next, we subtract the solar forcing, a linear increase of 1 W m−2over the
Cenozoic era due to the Sun’s 0.4% irradiance increase [ 121 ], and the surface albedo forcing due
to changing ice sheet size, which we take as linear at 5 W m−2for the 180 m sea-level change
from 35 Myr BP to the LGM. These top-of-the-atmosphere and surface forcings are moderate insize, compared with the total forcing over the Cenozoic, and partially offsetting, as shown in
the electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S4 b. The residual forcing, which has a maximum of
approximately 17 W m
−2just prior to 50 Myr BP , is the atmospheric forcing due to GHGs. Non-
CO 2GHGs contribute 25% of the total GHG forcing in the period of ice core measurements.
Atmospheric chemistry simulations [ 122 ] reveal continued growth of non-CO 2gases (N 2O, CH 4
and tropospheric O 3) in warmer climates, at only a slightly lower rate (1.7–2.3 W m−2for 4×CO 2,
which itself is approx. 8 W m−2). Thus, we take the CO 2forcing as 75% of the GHG forcing
throughout the Cenozoic in our standard case, but we also consider the extreme case in which
non-CO 2gases are ﬁxed and thus contribute no climate forcing.
AC O 2forcing is readily converted to the CO 2amount; we use the equation in table 1 of Hansen
et al. [89]. The resulting Cenozoic CO 2history required to yield the global surface temperature of
ﬁgure 4 ais shown in ﬁgure 8 afor state-independent climate sensitivity with non-CO 2GHGs
providing 25% of the GHG climate forcing. The peak CO 2in this case is approximately 2000 ppm.
If non-CO 2GHGs provide less than 25% of the total GHG forcing, then the inferred CO 2amount
would be even greater. Results for alternative sensitivities, as in ﬁgure 8 b, are calculated for a
temporal resolution of 0.5 Myr to smooth out glacial–interglacial CO 2oscillations, as our interest
here is in CO 2as a climate forcing.
We focus on the CO 2amount 50 Myr BP averaged over a few million years in assessing
the realism of our inferred CO 2histories, because CO 2variations in the Cenozoic remain very
uncertain despite the success of Beerling & Royer [ 9] in eliminating the most extreme outliers.
Beerling & Royer [ 9] ﬁnd a best-ﬁt CO 2at 50 Myr BP of about 1000 ppm—see their ﬁgure 1 ,w h i c h
also indicates that CO 2at 50 Myr BP was almost certainly in the range of 750–1500 ppm, even
though it is impossible to provide a rigorous conﬁdence interval.
We conclude that the average fast-feedback climate sensitivity during the Cenozoic is larger
than the canonical 3◦Cf o r2 ×CO 2(0.75◦Cp e rW m−2) that has long been the central estimate
for current climate. An average 4◦Cf o r2 ×CO 2(1◦Cp e rWm−2) provides a good ﬁt to the target
1000 ppm CO 2, but the sensitivity must be still higher if non-CO 2GHG forcings amplify the CO 2
by less than one-third, i.e. provide less than 25% of the total GHG forcing.
(a) State-dependentclimatesensitivity
More realistic assessment should account for the state dependence of climate sensitivity . Thus,
we make the same calculations for the state-dependent climate sensitivity of the Russell climatemodel, i.e. we use the fast-feedback climate sensitivity of ﬁgure 7 b. In addition, for the purpose
of assessing how the results depend upon climate sensitivity , we consider a second case in which
we reduce the Russell sensitivity of ﬁgure 7 bby the factor two-thirds.
The estimated 1000 ppm of CO
2at 50 Myr BP falls between the Russell sensitivity and two-
thirds of the Russell sensitivity , though closer to the full Russell sensitivity . If the non-CO 2GHG
forcing is less than one-third of the CO 2forcing, the result is even closer to the full Russell
sensitivity . With these comparisons at 50 Myr BP in mind, we can use ﬁgure 9 to infer the likely
CO 2amount at other times. The End-Eocene transition began at about 500 ppm and fell to about
400 ppm. The Mid-Miocene warmth, which peaked at about 15 Myr BP , required a CO 2increase on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 19rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................

is only two-thirds of the Russell sensitivity . The higher (full Russell) sensitivity requires much less
CO 2change to produce the Mid-Miocene warming for two reasons: (i) the greater temperature
change for a speciﬁed forcing and (ii) the smaller CO 2change required to yield a given forcing
from the lesser CO 2level of the higher sensitivity case. The average CO 2amount in the Early
Pliocene is about 300 ppm for the Russell sensitivity , but could reach a few tens of ppm higher ifthe true sensitivity is closer to two-thirds of the Russell sensitivity .
(b) ComparisonwithvandeWal et al.model
van de Wal et al. [123 ] used the same Zachos et al. [4]δ18O data to drive an inverse model
calculation, including an ice sheet model to separate ice volume and temperature, thus inferring
CO 2over the past 20 Myr. They ﬁnd an MMCO CO 2approximately 450 ppm, which falls between
the Russell and two-thirds Russell sensitivities ( ﬁgure 9 ). The van de Wal et al. [123 ]m o d e lh a s
a3 0◦C change in Northern Hemisphere temperature (their model is hemispheric) between the
MMCO and average Pleistocene conditions driven by a CO 2decline from approximately 450 ppm
to approximately 250 ppm, which is a forcing of approximately 3.5 W m−2. Thus, the implied
(Northern Hemisphere) Earth system sensitivity is an implausible approximately 35◦C for a
4Wm−2CO 2forcing. The large temperature change may be required to produce substantial sea-
level change in their ice sheet model, which we suggested above is unrealistically unresponsive on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 20rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................

inferring a fast-feedback sensitivity of only about 3◦Cp e rC O 2doubling.
(c) InferencesfromthePalaeocene–EoceneThermalMaximumandEarlyCenozoicclimate
Finally , we use the largest and best documented of the hyperthermals, the PETM, to test the
reasonableness of the Russell state-dependent climate sensitivity . Global warming in the PETM isreasonably well deﬁned at 5–6
◦C and the plausible range for carbon mass input is approximately
4000–7000 Pg C [ 14]. Given that the PETM carbon injection occurred over a period of a few
millennia, carbon cycle models suggest that about one-third of the carbon would be airborne
as CO 2following complete injection [ 21]. With a conversion factor of 1 ppm CO 2∼2.12 Gt C,
the 4000–7000 Gt C source thus yields approximately 630–1100 ppm CO 2.W ec a nu s e ﬁgure 10 ,
obtained via the same calculations as described above, to see how much CO 2is required to yield
a5◦C warming. The Russell sensitivity requires approximately 800 ppm CO 2for a 5◦Cw a r m i n g ,
whereas two-thirds of the Russell sensitivity requires approximately 2100 ppm CO 2. Given the
uncertainty in the airborne fraction of CO 2and possible non-CO 2gases, we cannot rule out the
two-thirds Russell sensitivity , but the full Russell sensitivity ﬁts plausible PETM carbon sources
much better, especially if the PETM warming is actually somewhat more than 5◦C( s e e ﬁgure 10
for quantitative implications).
This analysis is for Earth system sensitivity with CO 2as the forcing, as is appropriate for
the PETM because any carbon injected as CH 4would be rapidly oxidized to CO 2. Feedbacks on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 21rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................

in the PETM do not include large ice sheets, but non-CO 2GHGs are an unmeasured feedback. If a
warming climate increases the amount of N 2Oa n dC H 4in the air, the required carbon source for
a given global warming is reduced, because the amount of carbon in airborne CH 4is negligible.
Any non-CO 2GHG feedback increases the CO 2-forced Earth system sensitivity , potentially by a
large amount ( ﬁgure 10 ). The CO 2-forced Earth sensitivity is the most relevant climate sensitivity ,
not only for the PETM but for human-made forcings. Although present enhanced amounts of
airborne CH 4and N 2O are mostly a climate forcing, i.e. their increases above the pre-industrial
level are mainly a consequence of human-made sources, they also include a GHG feedback.
Climate sensitivity including this GHG feedback is the most relevant sensitivity for humanity
as the CO 2forcing continues to grow.
If the EECO global temperature exceeded 28◦C, as suggested by multi-proxy data taken at face
value (see above), climate sensitivity implied by the EECO warmth and the PETM warming is
close to the full Russell climate sensitivity (see electronic supplementary material, ﬁgures S7–S9).
We conclude that the existing data favour a climate sensitivity of at least two-thirds of the Russell
sensitivity , and probably closer to the full Russell sensitivity . That lower limit is just over 3◦Cf o r
2×CO 2for the range of climate states of immediate relevance to humanity ( ﬁgure 7 b).
7. Summarydiscussion
Covariation of climate, sea level and atmospheric CO 2through the Cenozoic era is a rich source of
information that can advise us about the sensitivity of climate and ice sheets to forcings, includinghuman-made forcings. Our approach is to estimate Cenozoic sea level and temperature from
empirical data, with transparent assumptions and minimal modelling. Our data are available in
the electronic supplementary material, allowing comparison with other data and model results.
(a) Sea-levelsensitivity
Hansen [ 49,50] argues that real ice sheets are more responsive to warming than in most ice
sheet models, which suggests that large ice sheets are relatively stable. The model of Pollard &
DeConto [ 124 ], for example, requires three to four times the pre-industrial CO 2amount to melt the
Antarctic ice sheet. This stability is, in part, a result of hysteresis: as the Earth warms, the ice sheet
size as a function of temperature does not return on the same path that it followed as temperature
fell and the ice sheet grew. We do not question the reality of mechanisms that cause ice sheet on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 22rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................hysteresis, but we suspect they are exaggerated in models. Thus, as an extreme alternative that
can be compared with ice sheet models and real-world data, we assume that hysteresis effects are
negligible in our approximation for sea level as a function of temperature.
Ice sheets in question are those on Greenland and Antarctica, ice sheets that could shrink with
future warming. Despite the stability of those ice sheets in the Holocene, there is evidence that sealevel was much more variable during the Eemian, when we estimate the peak global temperature
was only +1.0
◦C warmer than in the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century . Rohling et al. [52]
estimate an average rate of Eemian sea-level change of 1.4 m per century , and several studiesnoted above suggest that the Eemian sea level reached heights of +4–6 m or more relative to today .
The MMCO provides one test of hysteresis. Our sea-level approximation ( ﬁgure 2 ) suggests
that the Antarctic ice sheet nearly disappeared at that time. John et al. [125 ] provide support for
that interpretation, as well as evidence of numerous rises and falls of sea level by 20–30 m during
the Miocene. These variations are even larger than those we ﬁnd ( ﬁgure 2 ), but the resolution
of the δ
18O data we use is not adequate to provide the full amplitude of variations during that
period (electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S1).
The Mid-Pliocene is a more important test of ice sheet variability . We ﬁnd sea-level ﬂuctuations
of at least 20–40 m, much greater than in ice sheet models ( ﬁgure 2 ), with global temperature
variations of only a few degrees. Independent analyses designed to separate ice volume and
temperature change, such as Dwyer & Chandler [ 64], ﬁnd sea-level maxima and variability
comparable to our estimates. Altogether, the empirical data support a high sensitivity of the
sea level to global temperature change, and they provide strong evidence against the seeming
lethargy and large hysteresis effects that occur in at least some ice sheet models.
(b) Fast-feedbackclimatesensitivity
Estimates of climate sensitivity cover a wide range that has existed for decades [ 1,48,99]. That
range measures our ignorance; it does not mean that climate response from a speciﬁed stateis stochastic with such inherent uncertainty . God (Nature) plays dice, but not for such large
amounts. Indeed, one implication of the tight ﬁt of calculated and measured temperature change
of the past 800 000 years ( ﬁgure 6 ) is that there is a single well-deﬁned, but unknown, fast-
feedback global climate sensitivity for that range of climate, despite large regional climate
variations and ocean dynamical effects [ 31].
Improved empirical data can deﬁne climate sensitivity much more precisely , provided that
climate-induced aerosol changes are included in the category of fast feedbacks (human-made
aerosol changes are a climate forcing). Empirical assessment of fast-feedback climate sensitivity
is obtained by comparing two quasi-equilibrium climate states for which boundary conditionclimate forcings (which may be slow feedbacks) are known. Aerosol changes between those
climate states are appropriately included as a fast feedback, not only because aerosols respond
rapidly to changing climate but also because there are multiple aerosol compositions, they
have complex radiative properties and they affect clouds in several ways, thus making accurate
knowledge of their glacial–interglacial changes inaccessible.
The temporal variation of the GHG plus surface albedo climate forcing closely mimics the
temporal variation of either the deep ocean temperature ( ﬁgure 6 ) or Antarctic temperature [ 5,31]
for the entire 800 000 years of polar ice core data. However, the temperature change must be
converted to the global mean to allow inference of climate sensitivity . The required scale factor
is commonly extracted from an estimated LGM–Holocene global temperature change, which,
however, is very uncertain, with estimates ranging from approximately 3
◦C to approximately
6◦C. Thus, for example, the climate sensitivity (1.7–2.6◦Cf o r2 ×CO 2) estimated by Schmittner
et al. [94] is due largely to their assumed approximately 3◦C cooling in the LGM, and in lesser part
to the fact that they deﬁned some aerosol changes (dust) to be a climate forcing.
Climate sensitivity extracted from Pleistocene climate change is thus inherently partly
subjective as it depends on how much weight is given to mutually inconsistent estimates
of glacial-to-interglacial global temperature change. Our initial assessment is a fast-feedback on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 23rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................sensitivity of 3 ±1◦Cf o r2 ×CO 2, corresponding to an LGM cooling of 4.5◦C, similar to the
2.2–4.8◦C estimate of PALAEOSENS [ 99]. This sensitivity is higher than estimated by Schmittner
et al. [94], partly because they included natural aerosol changes as a forcing. In addition, we
note that their proxies for LGM sea surface cooling exclude planktic foraminifera data, which
suggest larger cooling [ 126 ], and, as noted by Schneider von Deimling et al. [95], regions
that are not sampled tend to be ones where the largest cooling is expected. It should be
possible to gain consensus on a narrower range for climate sensitivity via a community project
for the LGM analogous to PRISM Pliocene data reconstruction [ 97,98] and PlioMIP model
intercomparisons [ 67,68].
However, we suggest that an even more fruitful approach would be a focused effort to
deﬁne the glacial-to-interglacial climate change of the Eemian period (MIS-5e). The Eemianavoids the possibility of signiﬁcant human-made effects, which may be a factor in the Holocene.
Ruddiman [ 127 ] suggests that deforestation and agricultural activities affected CO
2and CH 4in
the Holocene, and Hansen et al. [91] argue that human-made aerosols were probably important.
Given the level of Eemian warmth, approximately +1.8◦C relative to 1880–1920, with a climate
forcing similar to that for LGM–Holocene ( ﬁgure 5 ), we conclude that this relatively clean
empirical assessment yields a fast-feedback climate sensitivity in the upper part of the rangesuggested by the LGM–Holocene climate change, i.e. a sensitivity of 3–4
◦Cf o r2 ×CO 2. Detailed
study is especially warranted because Eemian warmth is anticipated to recur in the near term.
(c) Earthsystemsensitivity
We have shown that global temperature change over the Cenozoic era is consistent with
CO 2change being the climate forcing that drove the long-term climate change. Proxy CO 2
measurements are so variable and uncertain that we only rely on the conclusion that the CO 2
amount was of the order of 1000 ppm during peak Early Eocene warmth. That conclusion, inconjunction with a climate model incorporating only the most fundamental processes, constrains
average fast-feedback climate sensitivity to be in the upper part of the sensitivity range that is
normally quoted [ 1,48,99], i.e. the sensitivity is greater than 3
◦Cf o r2 ×CO 2. Strictly this Cenozoic
evaluation refers to the average fast-feedback sensitivity for the range of climates from ice ages
to peak Cenozoic warmth and to the situation at the time of the PETM. However, it would be
difﬁcult to achieve that high average sensitivity if the current fast-feedback sensitivity were not
at least in the upper half of the range of 3 ±1◦Cf o r2 ×CO 2.
This climate sensitivity evaluation has implications for the atmospheric CO 2amount
throughout the Cenozoic era, which can be checked as improved proxy CO 2measurements
become available. The CO 2amount was only approximately 450–500 ppm 34 Myr BP when large-
scale glaciation ﬁrst occurred on Antarctica. Perhaps more important, the amount of CO 2required
to melt most of Antarctica in the MMCO was only approximately 450–500 ppm, conceivably onlyabout 400 ppm. These CO
2amounts are smaller than suggested by ice sheet/climate models,
providing further indication that the ice sheet models are excessively lethargic, i.e. resistant to
climate change. The CO 2amount in the earliest Pliocene, averaged over astronomical cycles, was
apparently only about 300 ppm, and decreased further during the Pliocene.
(d) Runawaygreenhouse
Our climate simulations, using a simpliﬁed three-dimensional climate model to solve the
fundamental equations for conservation of water, atmospheric mass, energy , momentum andthe ideal gas law, but stripped to basic radiative, convective and dynamical processes, ﬁnds
upturns in climate sensitivity at the same forcings as found with a more complex global climate
model [ 66]. At forcings beyond these points the complex model ‘crashed’, as have other climate
models (discussed by Lunt et al. [83]). The upturn at the 10–20 W m
−2negative forcing has a
simple physical explanation: it is the snowball Earth instability . Model crashes for large positive
forcings are sometimes described as a runaway greenhouse, but they probably are caused by one on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 24rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................of the many parametrizations in complex global models going outside its range of validity , not by
a runaway greenhouse effect.
The runaway greenhouse effect has several meanings ranging from, at the low end, global
warming sufﬁcient to induce out-of-control amplifying feedbacks, such as ice sheet disintegration
and melting of methane hydrates, to, at the high end, a V enus-like hothouse with crustal carbonbaked into the atmosphere and a surface temperature of several hundred degrees, a climate state
from which there is no escape. Between these extremes is the moist greenhouse, which occurs
if the climate forcing is large enough to make H
2O a major atmospheric constituent [ 106 ]. In
principle, an extreme moist greenhouse might cause an instability with water vapour preventing
radiation to space of all absorbed solar energy , resulting in very high surface temperature and
evaporation of the ocean [ 105 ]. However, the availability of non-radiative means for vertical
transport of energy , including small-scale convection and large-scale atmospheric motions, must
be accounted for, as is done in our atmospheric general circulation model. Our simulations
indicate that no plausible human-made GHG forcing can cause an instability and runawaygreenhouse effect as deﬁned by Ingersoll [ 105 ], in agreement with the theoretical analyses of
Goldblatt & Watson [ 128 ].
On the other hand, conceivable levels of human-made climate forcing could yield the low-
end runaway greenhouse. A forcing of 12–16 W m
−2, which would require CO 2to increase by a
factor of 8–16 times, if the forcing were due only to CO 2change, would raise the global mean
temperature by 16–24◦C with much larger polar warming. Surely that would melt all the ice on
the planet, and probably thaw methane hydrates and scorch carbon from global peat deposits and
tropical forests. This forcing would not produce the extreme V enus-like baked-crust greenhouse
state, which cannot be reached until the ocean is lost to space. A warming of 16–24◦C produces
a moderately moist greenhouse, with water vapour increasing to about 1% of the atmosphere’s
mass, thus increasing the rate of hydrogen escape to space. However, if the forcing is by fossil
fuel CO 2, the weathering process would remove the excess atmospheric CO 2on a time scale of
104–105years, well before the ocean is signiﬁcantly depleted. Baked-crust hothouse conditions on
the Earth require a large long-term forcing that is unlikely to occur until the sun brightens by afew tens of per cent, which will take a few billion years [ 121 ].
(e) Globalhabitability
Burning all fossil fuels would produce a different, practically uninhabitable, planet. Let us ﬁrst
consider a 12 W m−2greenhouse forcing, which we simulated with 8 ×CO 2.I fn o n - C O 2GHGs
such as N 2Oa n dC H 4increase with global warming at the same rate as in the palaeoclimate
record and atmospheric chemistry simulations [ 122 ], these other gases provide approximately
25% of the greenhouse forcing. The remaining 9 W m−2forcing requires approximately 4.8 ×CO 2,
corresponding to fossil fuel emissions as much as approximately 10,000 Gt C for a conservative
assumption of a CO 2airborne fraction averaging one-third over the 1000 years following a peak
emission [ 21,129 ].
Our calculated global warming in this case is 16◦C, with warming at the poles approximately
30◦C. Calculated warming over land areas averages approximately 20◦C. Such temperatures
would eliminate grain production in almost all agricultural regions in the world [ 130 ]. Increased
stratospheric water vapour would diminish the stratospheric ozone layer [ 131 ].
More ominously , global warming of that magnitude would make most of the planet
uninhabitable by humans [ 132 ,133 ]. The human body generates about 100 W of metabolic heat
that must be carried away to maintain a core body temperature near 37◦C, which implies that
sustained wet bulb temperatures above 35◦C can result in lethal hyperthermia [ 132 ,134 ]. Today ,
the summer temperature varies widely over the Earth’s surface, but wet bulb temperature is more
narrowly conﬁned by the effect of humidity , with the most common value of approximately
26–27◦C and the highest approximately of 31◦C. A warming of 10–12◦C would put most of
today’s world population in regions with wet a bulb temperature above 35◦C[132 ]. Given the
20◦C warming we ﬁnd with 4.8 ×CO 2, it is clear that such a climate forcing would produce on July 2, 2014 rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from 25rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org PhilTransRSocA371:20120294......................................................intolerable climatic conditions even if the true climate sensitivity is signiﬁcantly less than the
Russell sensitivity , or, if the Russell sensitivity is accurate, the CO 2amount required to produce
intolerable conditions for humans is less than 4.8 ×CO 2. Note also that increased heat stress
due to warming of the past few decades is already enough to affect health and workplace
productivity at low latitudes, where the impact falls most heavily on low- and middle-incomecountries [ 135 ].
The Earth was 10–12
◦C warmer than today in the Early Eocene and at the peak of the
PETM ( ﬁgure 4 ). How did mammals survive that warmth? Some mammals have higher internal
temperatures than humans and there is evidence of evolution of surface-area-to-mass ratio to
aid heat dissipation, for example transient dwarﬁng of mammals [ 136 ] and even soil fauna [ 137 ]
during the PETM warming. However, human-made warming will occur in a few centuries, asopposed to several millennia in the PETM, thus providing little opportunity for evolutionary
dwarﬁsm to alleviate impacts of global warming. We conclude that the large climate change from
burning all fossil fuels would threaten the biological health and survival of humanity , making
policies that rely substantially on adaptation inadequate.
Let us now verify that our assumed fossil fuel climate forcing of 9 W m
−2is feasible. If we
assume that fossil fuel emissions increase by 3% per year, typical of the past decade and of theentire period since 1950, cumulative fossil fuel emissions will reach 10 000 Gt C in 118 years.
However, with such large rapidly growing emissions the assumed 33% CO
2airborne fraction is
surely too small. The airborne fraction, observed to have been 55% since 1950 [ 1], should increase
because of well-known nonlinearity in ocean chemistry and saturation of carbon sinks, implying
that the airborne fraction probably will be closer to two-thirds rather than one-third, at least for a
century or more. Thus, the fossil fuel source required to yield a 9 W m−2forcing may be closer to
5000 Gt C, rather than 10 000 Gt C.
Are there sufﬁcient fossil fuel reserves to yield 5000–10 000 Gt C? Recent updates of
potential reserves [ 114 ], including unconventional fossil fuels (such as tar sands, tar shale
and hydrofracking-derived shale gas) in addition to conventional oil, gas and coal, suggest
that 5 ×CO 2(1400 ppm) is indeed feasible. For instance, using the emission factor for coal
from IPCC [ 48], coal resources given by the Global Energy Assessment [ 114 ] amount to 7300–
11 000 Gt C. Similarly , using emission factors from IPCC [ 48], total recoverable fossil energy
reserves and resources estimated by GEA [ 114 ] are approximately 15 000 Gt C. This does not
include large ‘additional occurrences’ listed in ch. 7 of GEA [ 114 ]. Thus, for a multi-centennial
CO 2airborne fraction between one-third and two-thirds, as discussed above, there are more than
enough available fossil fuels to cause a forcing of 9 W m−2sustained for centuries.
Most of the remaining fossil fuel carbon is in coal and unconventional oil and gas. Thus, it
seems, humanity stands at a fork in the road. As conventional oil and gas are depleted, will we
move to carbon-free energy and efﬁciency—or to unconventional fossil fuels and coal? If fossil
fuels were made to pay their costs to society , costs of pollution and climate change, carbon-free
alternatives might supplant fossil fuels over a period of decades. However, if governments forcethe public to bear the external costs and even subsidize fossil fuels, carbon emissions are likely to
continue to grow, with deleterious consequences for young people and future generations.
It seems implausible that humanity will not alter its energy course as consequences of burning
all fossil fuels become clearer. Yet strong evidence about the dangers of human-made climate
change have so far had little effect. Whether governments continue to be so foolhardy as to allow
or encourage development of all fossil fuels may determine the fate of humanity .
