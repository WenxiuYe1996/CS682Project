Abstract. The Pliocene epoch has great potential to improve
our understanding of the long-term climatic and environ-
mental consequences of an atmospheric CO 2concentration
near400 parts per million by volume. Here we present
the large-scale features of Pliocene climate as simulated by a
new ensemble of climate models of varying complexity and
spatial resolution based on new reconstructions of bound-ary conditions (the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project
Phase 2; PlioMIP2). As a global annual average, modelled
surface air temperatures increase by between 1.7 and 5.2C
relative to the pre-industrial era with a multi-model mean
value of 3.2C. Annual mean total precipitation rates in-
crease by 7 % (range: 2 %‚Äì13 %). On average, surface air
temperature (SAT) increases by 4.3C over land and 2.8C

over the oceans. There is a clear pattern of polar ampliÔ¨Å-
cation with warming polewards of 60N and 60S exceed-
ing the global mean warming by a factor of 2.3. In the At-
lantic and PaciÔ¨Åc oceans, meridional temperature gradients
are reduced, while tropical zonal gradients remain largely
unchanged. There is a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant relationship be-
tween a model‚Äôs climate response associated with a doubling
in CO 2(equilibrium climate sensitivity; ECS) and its simu-
lated Pliocene surface temperature response. The mean en-
semble Earth system response to a doubling of CO 2(includ-
ing ice sheet feedbacks) is 67 % greater than ECS; this is
larger than the increase of 47 % obtained from the PlioMIP1
ensemble. Proxy-derived estimates of Pliocene sea surface
temperatures are used to assess model estimates of ECS and
give an ECS range of 2.6‚Äì4.8C. This result is in general
accord with the ECS range presented by previous Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Re-
ports.
1 Introduction
1.1 Pliocene climate modelling and overview of the
Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project
Efforts to understand climate dynamics during the mid-
Piacenzian warm period (MP; 3.264 to 3.025 million years
ago), previously referred to as the mid-Pliocene warm period,
have been ongoing for more than 25 years. This is because
the study of the MP enables us to address important scientiÔ¨Åc
questions. The inclusion of a Pliocene experiment within the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)
experimental protocols underlines the general potential of the
Pliocene to address questions regarding the long-term sensi-
tivity of climate and environments to forcing, as well as the
determination of climate sensitivity speciÔ¨Åcally.
Beginning with the initial climate modelling studies of
Chandler et al. (1994), Sloan et al. (1996), and Haywood
et al. (2000), the complexity and number of climate models
used to study the MP has since increased substantially (e.g.
Haywood and Valdes, 2004). This progression culminated
in 2008 with the initiation of a co-ordinated international
model intercomparison project for the Pliocene (Pliocene
Model Intercomparison Project, PlioMIP). PlioMIP Phase 1
(PlioMIP1) proposed a single set of model boundary condi-
tions based on the U.S. Geological Survey PRISM3D dataset
(Dowsett et al., 2010) and a uniÔ¨Åed experimental design for
atmosphere-only and fully coupled atmosphere‚Äìocean cli-
mate models (Haywood et al., 2010, 2011).
PlioMIP1 produced several publications analysing diverse
aspects of MP climate. The large-scale temperature and pre-
cipitation response of the model ensemble was presented in
Haywood et al. (2013a). The global annual mean surface air
temperature was found to have increased compared to the
pre-industrial era, with models showing warming of between1.8 and 3.6C. The warming was predicted at all latitudes but
showed a clear pattern of polar ampliÔ¨Åcation resulting in a
reduced Equator to pole surface temperature gradient. Mod-
elled sea-ice responses were studied by Howell et al. (2016)
who demonstrated a signiÔ¨Åcant decline in Arctic sea-ice ex-
tent, with some models simulating a seasonally sea-ice-free
Arctic Ocean driving polar ampliÔ¨Åcation of the warming. The
reduced meridional temperature gradient inÔ¨Çuenced atmo-
spheric circulation in a number of ways, such as the poleward
shift of the middle-latitude westerly winds (Li et al., 2015).
In addition, Corvec and Fletcher (2017) studied the effect
of reduced meridional temperature gradients on tropical at-
mospheric circulation. They demonstrated a weaker tropical
circulation during the MP, speciÔ¨Åcally a weaker Hadley cir-
culation, and in some climate models also a weaker Walker
circulation, a response akin to model predictions for the fu-
ture (IPCC, 2013). Tropical cyclones (TCs) were analysed by
Yan et al. (2016) who demonstrated that average global TC
intensity and duration increased during the MP, but this result
was sensitive to how much tropical sea surface temperatures
(SSTs) increased in each model. Zhang et al. (2013, 2016)
studied the East Asian and west African summer monsoon
response in the PlioMIP1 ensemble and found that both were
stronger during the MP, whilst Li et al. (2018) reported that
the global land monsoon system during the MP simulated in
the PlioMIP1 ensemble generally expanded poleward with
increased monsoon precipitation over land.
The modelled response in ocean circulation was also ex-
amined in PlioMIP1. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation (AMOC) was analysed by Zhang et al. (2013).
No clear pattern of either weakening or strengthening of the
AMOC could be determined from the model ensemble, a re-
sult at odds with long-standing interpretations of MP merid-
ional SST gradients being a result of enhanced ocean heat
transport (OHT; e.g. Dowsett et al., 1992). Hill et al. (2014)
analysed the dominant components of MP warming across
the PlioMIP1 ensemble using an energy balance analysis.
In the tropics, increased temperatures were determined to
be predominantly a response to direct CO 2forcing, while at
high latitudes, changes in clear sky albedo became the domi-
nant contributor, with the warming being only partially offset
by cooling driven by cloud albedo changes.
The PlioMIP1 ensemble was used to help constrain equi-
librium climate sensitivity (ECS; Hargreaves and Annan,
2016). ECS is deÔ¨Åned as the global temperature response
to a doubling of CO 2once the energy balance has reached
equilibrium (this diagnostic is discussed further in Sect. 2.4).
Based on the PRISM3 (Pliocene Research, Interpretation and
Synoptic Mapping version 3) compilation of MP tropical
SSTs, Hargreaves and Annan (2016) estimated that ECS is
between 1.9 and 3.7C. In addition, the PlioMIP1 model en-
semble was used to estimate Earth system sensitivity (ESS).
ESS is deÔ¨Åned as the temperature change associated with
a doubling of CO 2and includes all ECS feedbacks along
with long timescale feedbacks such as those involving ice

sheets. In PlioMIP1, ESS was estimated to be a factor of 1.47
higher than the ECS (ensemble mean ECS D3:4C; ensem-
ble mean ESSD5:0C; Haywood et al., 2013a).
1.2 From PlioMIP1 to PlioMIP2
The ability of the PlioMIP1 models to reproduce patterns of
surface temperature change, reconstructed by marine and ter-
restrial proxies, was investigated via data‚Äìmodel compari-
son (DMC) in Dowsett et al. (2012, 2013) and Salzmann et
al. (2013) respectively. Although the PlioMIP1 ensemble was
able to reproduce many of the spatial characteristics of SST
and surface air temperature (SAT) warming, the models ap-
peared unable to simulate the magnitude of warming recon-
structed at the higher latitudes, in particular in the high North
Atlantic (Dowsett et al., 2012, 2013; Haywood et al., 2013a;
Salzmann et al., 2013). This problem has also been reported
as an outcome of DMC studies for other time periods in-
cluding the early Eocene (e.g. Lunt et al., 2012). Haywood
et al. (2013a, b) discussed the possible contributing factors
to the noted discrepancies in DMCs, noting three primary
causal groupings: uncertainty in model boundary conditions,
uncertainty in the interpretation of proxy data and uncertainty
in model physics (for example, recent studies have demon-
strated that this model‚Äìproxy mismatch has been reduced
by including explicit aerosol‚Äìcloud interactions in the newer
generations of models; Sagoo and Storelvmo, 2017; Feng et
al., 2019).
These Ô¨Åndings substantially inÔ¨Çuenced the experimen-
tal design for the second phase of PlioMIP (PlioMIP2).
SpeciÔ¨Åcally, PlioMIP2 was developed to (a) reduce uncer-
tainty in model boundary conditions and (b) reduce un-
certainty in proxy data reconstruction. To accomplish (a),
state-of-the-art approaches were adopted to generate an en-
tirely new palaeogeography (compared to PlioMIP1), includ-
ing accounting for glacial isostatic adjustments and changes
in dynamic topography. This led to speciÔ¨Åc changes com-
pared to the PlioMIP1 palaeogeography capable of inÔ¨Çuenc-
ing climate model simulations (Dowsett et al., 2016; Otto-
Bliesner et al., 2017). These include the Bering Strait and
Canadian Archipelago becoming subaerial and modiÔ¨Åcations
of the land‚Äìsea mask in the Indonesian and Australian re-
gion for the emergence of the Sunda and Sahul shelves.
To achieve (b), it was necessary to move away from time-
averaged global SST reconstructions and towards the exam-
ination of a narrow time slice during the late Pliocene that
has almost identical astronomical parameters to the present
day. This made the orbital parameters speciÔ¨Åed in model
experimental design consistent with the way in which or-
bital parameters would have inÔ¨Çuenced the pattern of sur-
face climate and ice sheet conÔ¨Åguration preserved in the ge-
ological record. Using the astronomical solution of Laskar et
al. (2004), Haywood et al. (2013b) identiÔ¨Åed a suitable inter-
glacial event during the late Pliocene (Marine Isotope Stage
KM5c, 3.205 Ma). The new PRISM4 (Pliocene Research, In-terpretation and Synoptic Mapping version 4) community-
sourced global dataset of SSTs (Foley and Dowsett, 2019)
targets the same interval in order to produce point-based SST
data.
Here we brieÔ¨Çy present the PlioMIP2 experimental design,
details of the climate models included in the ensemble and
the boundary conditions used. Following this, we present the
large-scale climate features of the PlioMIP2 ensemble fo-
cused solely on an examination of the control MP simula-
tion designated as a CMIP6 simulation (called midPliocene-
eoi400 ) and its differences to simulated conditions for the
pre-industrial era (PI). We also present key differences be-
tween PlioMIP2 and PlioMIP1. PlioMIP2 sensitivity experi-
ments will be presented in subsequent studies. We conclude
by presenting the outcomes from a DMC using the PlioMIP2
model ensemble and a newly constructed PRISM4 global
compilation of SSTs (Foley and Dowsett, 2019) and by as-
sessing the signiÔ¨Åcance of the PlioMIP2 ensemble in under-
standing equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and Earth sys-
tem sensitivity (ESS).
2 Methods
2.1 Boundary conditions
All model groups participating in PlioMIP2 were required
to use standardized boundary condition datasets for the
core midPliocene-eoi400 experiment (for wider accessibil-
ity, this experiment will hereafter be referred to as Plio Core).
These were derived from the U.S. Geological Survey PRISM
dataset, speciÔ¨Åcally the latest iteration of the reconstruc-
tion known as PRISM4 (Dowsett et al., 2016). They include
spatially complete gridded datasets at 11of latitude‚Äì
longitude resolution for the distribution of land versus sea,
topography and bathymetry, as well as vegetation, soils, lakes
and land ice cover. Two versions of the PRISM4 bound-
ary conditions were produced which are known as enhanced
and standard. The enhanced version comprises all PRISM4
boundary conditions including all reconstructed changes to
the land‚Äìsea mask and ocean bathymetry. However, groups
which are unable to change their land‚Äìsea mask can use the
standard version of the PRISM4 boundary conditions, which
provides the best possible realization of Pliocene conditions
based around a modern land‚Äìsea mask. In practice, all mod-
els except MRI-CGCM2.3 were able to utilize the enhanced
boundary conditions. For full details of the PRISM4 recon-
struction and methods associated with its development, the
reader is referred to Dowsett et al. (2016; this special issue).
2.2 Experimental design
The experimental design for Plio Coreand associated PI con-
trol experiments (hereafter referred to as PI Ctrl) was pre-
sented in Haywood et al. (2016a; this special issue), and
the reader is referred to this paper for full details of the ex-
https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-2095-2020 Clim. Past, 16, 2095‚Äì2123, 20202098 A. M. Haywood et al.: Pliocene climate and climate sensitivity
perimental design. In brief, participating model groups had
a choice of which version of the PRISM4 boundary condi-
tions to implement (standard or enhanced). This approach
was taken in recognition of the technical complexity as-
sociated with the modiÔ¨Åcation of the land‚Äìsea mask and
ocean bathymetry in some of the very latest climate and
earth system models. A choice was also included regard-
ing the treatment of vegetation. Model groups could either
prescribe vegetation cover from the PRISM4 dataset (vege-
tation sourced from Salzmann et al., 2008) or simulate the
vegetation using a dynamic global vegetation model. If the
latter was chosen, all models were required to be initialized
with pre-industrial vegetation and spun up until an equilib-
rium vegetation distribution was reached. The concentration
of atmospheric CO 2for experiment Plio Corewas set at 400
parts per million by volume (ppmv), a value almost iden-
tical to that chosen for the PlioMIP1 experimental design
(405 ppmv) and in line with the very latest high-resolution
proxy reconstruction of atmospheric CO 2of400 ppmv for
3:2 million years ago using boron isotopes (De La Vega
et al., 2018). However, we acknowledge that there are un-
certainties on the KM5c CO 2value; hence, the speciÔ¨Åcation
of Tier 1 PlioMIP2 experiments (Haywood et al., 2016a),
which have CO 2of350 and 450 ppmv, will be used to
investigate CO 2uncertainty at a later date. All other trace
gases, orbital parameters and the solar constant were spec-
iÔ¨Åed to be consistent with each model‚Äôs PI Ctrlexperiment.
The Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) was conÔ¨Åned to high eleva-
tions in the eastern Greenland mountains, covering an area
approximately 25 % of the present-day GIS. The PlioMIP2
Antarctic ice sheet conÔ¨Åguration is the same as PlioMIP1
and has no ice over western Antarctica. The reconstructed
PRISM4 ice sheets have a total volume of 20 :1106km3,
which is equal to a sea-level increase relative to the present
day of less than24 m (Dowsett et al., 2016; this special
issue). The integration length was set to be as long as pos-
sible or a minimum of 500 simulated years; however, all
but two of the modelling groups in PlioMIP2 contributed
simulations that were in excess of 1000 years (Table S1 in
the Supplement). All modelling groups were requested to
fully detail their implementation of PRISM4 boundary con-
ditions along with the initialization and spin-up of their ex-
periments in separate dedicated papers that also present some
of the key scientiÔ¨Åc results from each model or family of
models (see the separate papers within this special volume:
https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/special_issue642.html, last
access: 16 September 2020, Haywood et al., 2016b). NetCDF
versions of all boundary conditions used for the Plio Coreex-
periment, along with guidance notes for modelling groups,
can be found here: https://geology.er.usgs.gov/egpsc/prism/
7.2_pliomip2_data.html (last access: 16 September 2020).2.3 Participating models
There are currently 16 climate models that have completed
the Plio Core experiment to comprise the PlioMIP2 ensem-
ble. These models were developed at different times and
have differing levels of complexity and spatial resolution. A
further model HadGEM3 is currently running the Plio Core
experiment and results from this model will be compared
with the rest of the PlioMIP2 ensemble in a subsequent
paper. The current 16 model ensemble is double the size
of the coupled atmosphere‚Äìocean ensemble presented in
the PlioMIP1 large-scale features publication (Haywood et
al., 2013a). Summary details of the included models and
model physics, along with information regarding the imple-
mentation of PRISM4 boundary conditions and each model‚Äôs
ECS, can be found in Tables 1 and S1. Each modelling group
uploaded the Ô¨Ånal 100 years of each simulation for analysis.
These were then regridded onto a regular 11grid using a
bilinear interpolation to enable each model to be analysed in
the same way. Means and standard deviations for each model
were then calculated across the Ô¨Ånal 50 years.
2.4 Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and Earth
system sensitivity (ESS)
In Sect. 3.6, we use the Plio Coreand PI Ctrlsimulations to in-
vestigate ECS and ESS. The Plio Coreexperiments represent
a 400 ppmv world that is in quasi-equilibrium with respect to
both climate and ice sheets and hence represents an ‚ÄúEarth
system‚Äù response to the 400 ppmv CO 2forcing. The Earth
system response to a doubling of CO 2(i.e. 560‚Äì280 ppmv;
ESS) can then be estimated as follows:
ESSDln560
280
ln400
280(Plio Core[SAT]"
