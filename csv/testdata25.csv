Abstract  
 
TITLE: Building Climate Resilience at NASA Ames  
AUTHORS: Laura Iraci , Chase  Mueller, Jim Podolske  
 
NASA Ames Research Center, located at the southern end of the San Francisco Bay 
(SFB) estuary has identified three primary vulnerabilities to changes in climate. The 
Ames Climate Adaptation Science Investigator (CASI) workgroup has studied each of 
these  challenges to operations and the potential exposure of infrastructure and 
employees to an increased frequency of hazards.   
Sea level rise inundation scenarios for the SFB Area generally refer to projected 
scenarios in mean sea level rather than changes in e xtreme tides that could occur 
during future storm conditions. In the Summer of 2014, high resolution  3-D 
mapping of the low lying portion of Ames was performed. Those data are integrated 
with improved sea level inundation scenarios to identify the building s, basements 
and drainage systems potentially affected. We will also identify the impacts of sea 
level and storm surge effects on transportation to and from the Center. This 
information will help Center Management develop future Master Plans.  
Climate chan ge will also lead to changes in temperature, storm frequency and 
intensity. These changes have potential impacts on localized floods and ecosystems, 
as well as on electricity and water availability. Over the coming decades, these 
changes are going to be im posed on top of ongoing land use and land cover changes, 
especially those deriving from continued urbanization and increase in impervious 
surface areas. These coupled changes have the potential to create a series of 
cascading impacts on ecosystems, includi ng changes in primary productivity and 
disturbance of hydrological properties and increased flood risk.  
The majority of the electricity used at Ames is supplied by hydroelectric dams, 
which will be influenced by reductions in precipitation or changes in th e timing or 
phase of precipitation which reduces snow pack. Coupled with increased demand 
for summertime air conditioning and other cooling needs, NASA Ames is at risk for 
electricity shortfalls. To assess the anticipated energy usage as climate changes, t he 
Ames CASI team is collecting historical energy usage data from Ames facilities, 
historical weather data, and projected future weather parameters from the CASI 
Climate subgroup.  This data will be incorporated into the RETScreen model to 
predict how ener gy usage at Ames will change over the coming century.
