The Arctic is experiencing  rapid climate change  in response to changes in greenhouse gases, 
aerosols and other climate drivers. Emission changes in general, as well as geographical  
shifts in emissions and transport pathways  of short -lived climate forcers , make it necess ary 
to understand the influence o f each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver 
Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five 
different climate drivers separately (CO 2, CH 4, the solar constant, BC and SO 4). We show that 
the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global 
mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between  climate drivers, ranging from 
1.9 (± an inter -model standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (± 0.6 ) for the SO4 
perturbations , with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers . The vertical and 
seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar 
mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For a ll drivers , the precipitation change per 
degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic , with a seasonality following that 
of the Arctic amplification . We find indications that SO 4 perturbations produce a slightly 
stronger precipitation response than the other drivers , particularly compared to CO 2. 
Key Points:  
 Arctic amplification of surface warming is similar between  global  drivers of climate 
change  
 Black carbon induces differing v ertical and seasonal amplification  patterns  
 Sulfa te affects Arctic precipitation responses more strongly  than  other drivers, 
particularly in the summer season

Both observat ions and climate models indicate that the temperature increase in the Arctic 
has been substantially larger than the globally averaged warming  since preindustrial times 
(Cowtan and Way, 2014; Hartmann et al., 2013; Holland and Bitz, 2003) . This phenomenon 
is known as Arctic amplification  (AA) . Locally, th e Arctic amplification  involves  pronounced 
reductions in sea ice cover  (AMAP, 2017; Kay et al., 2011; Notz and Stroeve, 2016) , 
increasing Arctic methane emissions from permafrost degradation (Anthony et al., 2016) , 
changes to the mass balance of glaciers and ice sheets (Shepherd et al., 2012)  and 
detrime ntal influences on Arctic ecosystems (Hinzman et al., 2013)  and indigenous 
peoples  (IPCC, 2014 ). Future changes in shipping and other anthropogenic activities in the 
Arctic  (Peter s et al., 2011)  can induce further climate  change  and health  impacts in this 
sensitive region . The strong Arctic warming  can also have far-reaching global implications  
(Zappa et al., 2018) . For instance, there are signs that  enhanced melting  of Arctic sea ice 
and glaciers  influences  the Atlantic overturning circulation  (Caesar et al., 2018; Yang et 
al., 2016) . Cohen et al. (2014)  and Coumou et al. (2018)  point out that the AA can influence 
mid-latitude weather via changes in storm tracks, the jet stream, and planetary waves and 
their associated energy propagation.  Similarly, teleconnections between the Arctic and 
the Asian continent ha ve been demonstrated through influences on the winter monsoon 
(Gong et al., 2001)  and on the frequency of unusually hard winters (Kug et al., 2015)  in 
East Asia.  
The AA is caused by local forcings  and feedbacks as well as by remote forcing, but the 
relative importance of these impacts is still debated. While previous invest igations 
commonly attributed the main cause of AA to the snow and ice albedo feedbacks (Hall, 
2004; Manabe and Stouffer, 1980) , an idealized model experiment by Alexeev et al. (2005) , 
in which the surface albedo was fixed, demonstra ted that poleward energy transport from 
lower latitudes alone could create an AA. The importance of lower -latitude impacts on the 
Arctic through transport of heat and moisture has been stressed by many studies 
(Graversen and Wang, 2009; Screen et al., 2012; Yoshimori et al., 2017) , and a  recent 
analysis  by Yoshimori et al. (2017)  found that the effect of remote forcing is predominant in 
the Arctic warming.  Other  studies report that the AA is dominated by local forcings and 
feedbacks (Stuecker et al. 2016), and point to the importance of processes such a s the water 
vapor and cloud feedbacks (Graversen and Wang, 2009)  or the lapse -rate and Planck 
feedbacks  (Pithan and Mauritsen, 2014) , in addition to the ice albedo feedback (Laîné et al., 
2016; Screen and Simmonds, 2010) . Whether or not local processes dominate, the 
possibility of an influence from forcing at lower latitudes remain. This makes the origin of 
this forcing  relevant , as h omogeneously distributed greenhouse gases and highly regional 
aerosols may influence  the AA differently .  
While several multi -model studies based on CMIP5 models have focused on the Arctic 
(Barnes and Polvani, 2015; Clara and Dirk, 2017; Franzke et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2017) , 
none have , to our knowledge , looked at different drivers independently. The Precipitation  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP) (Myhre et al., 2017)  provides a 
unique dataset  that allows  for investigations into climate responses to separate and clearly 
defined climate drivers, such as greenhouse gases or aerosols , in a multi -model framework . 
This has led the way for several studies that have investigated various aspects of climate 
driver -response  relationships from  a global perspective  (Liu et al., 2018; Samset et al., 2018; 
Samset et al. , 2016; Stjern et al., 2017) . Here we use the PDR MIP data set to analyze the 
climate response in the Arctic (defined as the region north of 60°N ). Our main object ive is to 
see whether clear differences exist with respect to how different climate drivers influence 
the Arctic . We do this by providing  descriptive accounts of how changes to precipitation and 
the Arctic amplification vary between the drivers . Our ma in focus is on experiments where 
the drivers are perturbed globally, but w e also examine the response to isolated 
perturbations of aerosols i n two  different source regions. For aerosols and other short -lived 
climate drivers, the location of emissions can be important to the subsequent impact on 
global and regional climate (Lund et al., 2014; Sand et al., 2013; Sand et al ., 2016; Screen et 
al., 2012; Shindell et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2018) . Wobus et al. (2016)  find that different 
future emission scenarios produce large variations in the resulting Arctic temperature 
change . Hence, as future changes in emissions and transport pathways (Jiao and Flanner, 
2016)  may shift the role of drivers, and their sources, in Arctic climate change , quantifying 
regional depe ndence of the forcing and response relationship is important . Combined, t his 
will improve our understanding of the processes governing Arctic climate change today and 
allow us to make more informed predictions for future changes under various emission 
path way scenario s. 
The next  section gives an account of the data and methodology used in the present 
analyses. Section 3 shows spatially and temporally resolved Arctic temperature respon ses to 
global perturbations of five climate drivers , including a quantification of  the slow 
temperature -driven feedback response . A similar account of precipitation responses is given 
in Section 4, including a n energy budget analysis of differences between drivers. A separate 
analysis of Arctic responses to regional aerosol perturbations is presented in Section 5. 
Results are discussed in Section 6 and summarized in Section 7.   
 
2 Methods  
The PDRMIP dataset is  described in detail by Myhre et al. (2017) . Briefly, ten global climate 
models performed experiments where five different climate drivers were perturbed 
separately . Relative to a baseline, the perturbations involve d a doubling of CO 2 
concentrations (CO2x2) , a tripling of CH 4 concentrations (CH4x3) , a two percent increase in 
the solar constant  (SOL) , a tenfold increase in BC concentrations or emissions (BCx10) , and a 
fivefold increase in SO4 concentrations or emissions (SO4x5) , respectively . In addition, seven  
of the models (see Table S1) performed three regional experiments, which simulated the 
effects of a tenfold increase in BC over  Asia (BCx10asia) and in SO4 over  Asia and Europe  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  (SO4x10asia and SO4x10europe). Here, Asia was defined as 10 -50°N and 60 -140°E, and 
Europe as 35 -70°N and 10 -40°E. These results will be described in Section 5.  
All perturbations were instantaneous, and simulations were performed in two mod es for 
both the baseline and perturbed states;  
1) A fully coupled mode , for which  equilibrium simulations were run for 100 years . 
Years 51 -100 were used  in our analyses.  These simulations give the total climate 
response.  
2) A set -up with fixed sea surface temperatures (fixed -SST), which were run for  15 
years . Years  6 to 15 were used in the analyses. These simulations give the fast (on 
the order of days to months) climate response.  
The baseline represents present -day conditions focuse d at the beginning of this century  
(except HadGEM2 -ES, which used preindustrial conditions) , but the exact year and emission 
dataset used varies slightly between models (see Table S1). For the aerosol experiments, 
five of the models  (Table S1)  performed co ncentration -driven simulations  using identical 
aerosol concentrations based on the year 2000 monthly multi -model mean of the models in 
AeroCom Phase II (Myhre et al., 2013; Samset et al., 2013)  as a baseline . Of the remaining 
models, one was not able to perform aerosol perturbations at all, while four used present -
day aerosol emissions as a baseline. In the emission -driven models, responses to the 
increase in aerosols (e.g., increased precipitation) can feed back on the aerosol 
concentrations (e.g., increased wet removal of the aerosols) and potentially dampen or 
amplify the change. Sand e t al. (2015)  found in a comparison of emission -driven and 
concentration -driven BC perturbation experiments that Arctic responses were stronger in 
the emission -driven simulations. These model differences will therefore be kept in mind in 
the subsequent a nalyses.  
The ten models represent a selection of Earth System Models with a broad variation in 
schemes and formulations. Three of the models include a represent ation of  the radiative 
impact  of BC on snow  (Table S1) . Furthermore, microphysical aerosol inter actions with 
clouds (aerosol indirect effects) is accounted for in eight models  (three of these  also include 
an indirect effect of BC).   
The fixed -SST simulations were utilized to calculate effective radiative f orcing (ERF) as 
recommended in Forster et al. (2016) , i.e., the change in net radiative long -wave (LW) plus 
short -wave (SW) fluxes at the top of atmosphere (TOA).  As indicated above, the f ixed-SST 
simulations are also used to study the fast (on the order of days to months) response of the 
climate system to the initial perturbation , also refer red to as rapid adjustments.  The total 
climate response, often (but not always) dominated by the surface -temperature change, is 
derived from the coupled simulations.  These two sets of simulations then allow us also to 
extract the pure surface temperature -driven feedback response  (also referred to as the slow 
response) as the total response minus the fast response.

In this section, we document and discuss the Arctic temperature responses to the global 
perturbations. We cover annual mean and seasonally resolved surface responses, the 
separation between rapid responses and global surface temperature driven changes, and 
the vertical structure of the temperature response. We then conclude the section with a  
discussion on inter -model differences  due to the inclusion of radiative effects of BC on snow 
in some of the models .    
3.1 Annual ly and seasonally resolved temperature responses  
As shown in previous PDRMIP studies  (Myhre et al., 2017; Samset et al., 2016; Stjern et al., 
2017) , the different perturbations cause very dissimilar responses in global mean 
temperature and ERF, with model mean warming ( and ERF) varying from 2.45  K (3.78 Wm-2) 
for CO2x2 to  0.61  K (0.66  Wm-2) for BCx10. To facilitate comparison between the different 
climate drivers, Fig . 1 shows changes per degree global temperature change in Arctic surface 
temperature  (the AA) and precipitation for each given model and experiment. Hatched bars 
indicate the regional aerosol perturbation experiments, which will be discussed in Section 5. 
For absolute changes for individual models the reader is referred to Fig. S1. Note here and 
throughout the paper that an increase in SO 4 gives a positive normalized temperature (and 
precipitation) change since the negative response it causes  in the Arctic  is normalized by a 
negative global temperature change . The horizontal grey line shows the average AA of the 
five global perturbations .

the axes limits. Graphs show monthly mean changes (for the global experiments only).  
 
We find that the AA is not significantly different ( at the 95 % confidence level, by using a 
Student’s t -test) between any of the  global  experiments . The multi -model median AA ranges 
from 1.9 (SOL ; ± an inter -model standard deviation of 0.4 ) to 2.3 (SO4x5 ; ± 0.6 ) between the 
drivers.  The horizontal grey line shows the average AA of the five global perturbations, and 
none of the solid bars deviate much from this line. Note, however, that  the inter -model 
spread is substantially larger tha n the differences in model median AA between 
experiments. This inter -model range  is partly due to the large spread in Arctic responses, 
but also due to large model differences in the global response . For instance , the outlier in 
the upper panel of Fig. 1  is CE SM-CAM5, for which a very small global response to the BCx10 
experiment produces an anomalously high AA.  CESM -CAM5’s weak temperature response is 
linked to the model’s short BC lifetime for the BCx10 experiment (Stjern et al., 2017) . With a 
few exceptions, we find that models with an above -average AA for one driver tends to have 
high values for all drivers  (and vice versa). This means that the tendency of similar AA 
regardless of driver is found both for the multi -model medians and for individual model s. 
The AA is smallest  during summ er for all the climate drivers  (Fig. 1, upper rightmost panel) . 
That  amplification is weakest during Arctic summer is well documented elsewhere: I n 
studies based on realistic historical or future scenarios with emission changes in both 
greenhouse gases and aerosols (Acosta Navarro et al., 2016; Laîné et al., 2016; Screen et al., 
2012) , in single -perturbation experime nts for e.g. SO 4 (Yang et al., 2018)  or CO 2 (Yoshimori 
et al., 2017) , and in observations (Graversen et al., 2008) . The positive ice albedo feedback is 
strong est in spring and summer , but is counteracted  by strong energy uptake by the Arctic 
ocean (Laîné et al., 2016) , as well as by an increase in evaporation (Acosta Navarro et al., 
2016; Laîné et al., 2016)  and potentially also cloud  response s (Crook et al., 2011; Yoshimori 
et al., 2017) . During winter , on the other hand, the warming from heat release by the ocean  
is strengthened by positive cloud and lapse rate feedbacks  (Laîné et al., 2016; Sejas et al., 
2014) . The dominating mechanisms contributing to this seasonal cycle differ between land 
and ocean surfaces,  with the tendency for a stronger seasonal AA cycle over oceans (Laîné 
et al., 2016) . Here, we confirm that this seasonality is not a greenhouse gas -specific 
response but is in fact climate driver independent.  To study the  land -/ocean -contrast in 
seasonality , we have repeat ed the analysis behind Fig. 1  for Arctic land -only and ocean -only 
responses . Figure S2 shows that the annually avera ged AA are consistently stronger over 
ocean than over land , supporting Laîné et al. (2016) . This is true  for all drivers. W e note  that 
the land/ocean difference can partly be an effect of latitude: the higher Arctic (where AA is 
found to be stronger , see  Fig. 2) consist s mostly of oceans while lower latitudes include 
much more land . Interestingly, over Arctic land surfaces there seems to be a secondary 
maximum in spring/early summer for BCx10. This is potentially related to the inclusion of  
the radiative effect of BC on snow (which is strongest in this season ) in some models  – see

3.2     Separating Arctic amplification into rapid responses and feedbacks from global 
temperature change  
A key methodology in PD RMIP is to separate the climate response to an instantaneous 
perturbation into rapid responses (diagnosed from fixed sea -surface temperature 
simulations), and the slow feedback response to a change in global mean surface 
temperature. In Figure S 3, we perform this separation for the AA shown in Fig . 1.  
Overall, we find weak rapid response contributions to AA. However, when removing the fast 
response to isolate the global mean temperature induced AA  (the slow feedback response) , 
the driver differences s een in Fig . 1 are reduced  (Fig. S 3). While the standard deviation of 
the multi -model median AA between these four drivers is 0.16 for the total AA (Fig. 1), the 
feedback response has a much smaller standard deviation of 0.03. SO 4, on the other hand, 
which had a non -significantly stronger AA than the other drivers for the total response, has 
an AA feedback response that is 40 % stronger than the other drivers, and the difference is 
now statistically significant.  
The only driver to show a rapid adjustment AA  significantly different from zero is CO 2. We 
interpret this to be due to its atmospheric absorption, which will act to heat the 
atmospheric column. The other driver with significant absorption, BC, has relatively little 
change in the Arctic, as discussed below.   
Recently, Huneeus et al. (2014)  compared climate effects of pert urbations to CO 2 and the 
solar constant. They found that particularly for the feedback response, the similarity was 
remarkable, while rapid adjustments introduced more dissimilar responses. Ov erall, our 
results are consistent with this finding.  
 
3.3 Geographical  temperature  response patterns  
In Figure 2, we show the multi -model geographical pattern of AA.  Overall the different 
drivers produce qualitatively similar patterns , with a maximum around the northernmost 
parts of the Barents Sea , correspond ing to the  region where all climate drivers produce the 
greates t loss in sea ice  (Fig. S 4). It should be noted that the location of this maximum 
warming may – at least partly – be an artifact of the tendency for models to have a low 
temperature bias in this region. For instance, Chapman and Walsh (2007)  found that 12 out 
of 14 models have a cold temperature bias in the Barents sea  due to too extensive sea i ce, 
and that the same models showed strongest projected temperature changes in this region . 
Still, the main point – that warming patterns are similar between drivers – remains. Maps of 
ERF demonstrate that the radiative forcing for all drivers is larger at  the lower latitudes than 
in the Arctic, meaning that  the regional ERF pattern is not an important contribution to the  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  AA (Fig. 3 ). This is also true when we look at the pattern of ERF at the surface (not shown), 
which might be more indicative of regional responses than the TOA forcing. The similarity in 
AA patterns and the decoupling of the AA from the original forcing pattern  further  imply  
that the A A is not driver specific.

3.4 Vertical structure of the Arctic amplification  
In Figure 4, we show the vertical structure of the Arctic amplification. Some studie s have 
suggested  that the vertical dimension can provide further insights into the processes driving 
surface heating in the Arctic region. Sea ice or sea surface temperature changes are typically 
found to induce strongest response near the Arctic surface (Screen et al., 2012) , while 
changes driven by processes such as changes in poleward heat transport or concentrations 
of water vapor or clouds will have a maximum response in the mid -troposphere (Chung and 
Räisänen, 2011; Graversen and Wa ng, 2009; Yang et al., 2010) . Note, however, that local 
responses and feedbacks will complicate such a clear interpretation.   
As seen from Fig. 4 a, increases in CO 2, CH 4, the solar constant and SO 4 cause very similar 
vertical patterns in the Arctic, with a strong surface AA  and an upper -level (a round  200 hPa) 
negative AA, visible  as areas over Arctic latitudes  with blue shades in the figure . This upper 
tropospheric cooling is a typical sign of a warming climate and an associated lifting of the 
tropopause, which cau ses temperatures to drop at pressure levels that used to be a part of 
the warmer stratosphere in the baseline simulations, but are included in the (colder) upper 
troposphere in the perturbed climate  (see e.g. Gillett et al., 2003) . This is not to be confused 
with the well -known stratospheric cooling following increased CO 2 (Ramanathan and 
Dickinson, 1979) , which is also visible in Fig. 2a for CO2x2, but at higher altitudes. Th e upper 
tropospheric  cooling is not visible for BC in the annual mean, but in Fig. 4b , where  we show 
monthly mean Arctic changes , we find that BC causes a similar  upper  tropospheric  cooling 
as the other climate drivers  during January through March .

Figure 4.  Multi -model median vertically resolved change in Arctic amplification for a) the annual mean for 
latitudes 0 to 90 °N and for b) the Arctic (60 to 90 °N) average for each month of the year. Hatching 
indicates where fewer than 75 % of the models agr ee on the sign of the change.  
 
For the rest of the year, however, the warming from BC extends throughout the 
atmospheric column. BC is known to induce efficient local heating of the atmosphere, and 
has an  absorption efficiency that increases with height (Samset and Myhre, 2011) . In the 
Arctic, the atmospheric warming from  BC absorption is particularly strong due to the high 
surface albedo. The warming pattern is therefore linked to the spatiotemporal distribution 
of BC concentrations. Figure S 5a shows the BC x10 mass mixing ratio that the concentration -
based models use as input. The largest BC concentration changes occur, as expected, at the 
surface aro und 40°N, where emissions are largest. At these latitudes, air masses are 
effectively lifted by convection, resulting in elevated concentrations also at higher altitudes, 
where aerosols are transported northwards. This transport is most effective during su mmer

corresponding warming in Fig. 4 b. The strong decline in available SW radiation towards fall 
and winter also means that the radiative effect of increasing concentrations ( i.e., absorption 
of SW and consequent atmospheric warming) will be highest in the summer . At lower 
altitudes, the polar dome limits the meridional transport into the Arctic, in particular during 
winter  (Stohl, 2006) . In addition, the aerosols that are lofted at lower latitudes give strong 
high -altitude warming, as illustrated in Fig. S 5c, where the seasonal warming averaged over 
East Asia, the major source region (Fig. S 5a), for the g lobal BCx10 experiment is shown. This 
heat (and the associated increase in water vapor ) therefore does not need to be elevated 
from the surface through convection but can be transported directly  poleward . 
Comparing  the AA profile  pattern s between  0 to 90°N for winter and summer months  
separately (Fig. S 6), we find that the warming pattern for BCx10 has a much stronger 
pole ward extension in summer , consistently  with  the strong within -Arctic  summertime 
warming around 500 hPa . Graversen et al. (2008)   found a similar upper -level summertime 
amplification in reanalysis data . They  pointed out that the source of this hig h-altitude AA 
could not be surface driven (i.e., snow and ice feedbacks) and attribute d it instead to 
summertime changes in the northward energy transport.  This upper -level AA is however not 
visible in all reanalysis data sets  (Bitz and Fu, 2008; Grant et al., 2008) . While most 
pronounced for BC,  the pattern of uppe r-level summertime warming is present for all 
climate drivers  in our simulations . Dedicated studies are needed to further quantify  the role 
of northward heat transport to the consistent heating around 500 hPa . 
For all drivers , the surface AA is lowest in summer . Previous studies have found that one 
reason  for this is that (surface) warming from the ice albedo effect can be partially cancelled 
by an increase in summertime cloud cover (Crook et al., 2011) . However, while  an increase 
in summertime cloud cover is an expected response to the reduced sea ice cover  in climate 
models (Vavrus, 2004; Yoshimori et al., 2014) , observations indicate that the summer is the 
only season  which lacks a cloud -response to sea ice changes (Morrison et al., 2018) , and 
that the  cloud response tends to be strongest in  fall (Kay and Gettelman, 2009) . Here, we 
find that  while the s ea ice reductions are similar  between the drivers (Fig. S 4), changes in  
cloud amounts vary (Fig. 5) , with no general tendency of a summertime increase  for any of 
the drivers except BC . BCx10  causes a 5 % increase in summertime low cloud cover  (defined 
as the vertical average of cloud fractions between the surface and 680 hPa) , contrasting a 
very weak increase or (for CO2x2) a reduction for the other climate drivers. The BC -induced 
increase in low level clouds would act both to dampen the summe rtime surface warming, 
and (by reflecting incoming SW back towards the aerosol layer and adding to the amount of 
SW available for absorption) enhance the strong upper -level warming . Note also that 
around 500 hPa, all climate drivers cause a reduction in cl ouds, consistent with the upper -
level summertime warming  (Fig. 4b) . This response  is strongest for BC, for which the 
warming is greatest.

In the wintertime, there is an upward shift  the lowe r-most  clouds  in response to all  drivers , 
conceivably associated with an increase in specific humidity and therefore the lifting 
condensation level, as the atmosphere  warms. A similar Arctic cloud response was found in 
a modelling study by (Gillett et al., 2003)  as a response to CO 2 doubling. Li et al. (2014)  
noted a link between reduced Arctic boundary layer stability and a deepening of the 
boundary layer  in satellite data . The same features are found in our results during winter , 
seen as a thickening of the low -level c loud layer . This change in low-level wintertime cloud is 
important as it  will primarily act to enhance the surface warming through their long wave 
warming effect  in the absence of incoming solar radiation . 
3.5 Model differences  in BC-induced Arctic Amplification  
Light -absorbing particles , such as BC , deposited on snow and ice  may reduce the albedo and 
enhance  melting, with potentially large impact s on the radiative budget  . Of the ten PDRMIP  
models , three include the radiative effect of BC on snow . Figure 6 shows AA responses to 
the BCx10  experiment  from individu al models. M odel names are marked with [S] if they 
include BC on snow  and are shown as solid lines in the righthand panel . We focus on land -
average AA, where BC snow -albedo effects are expected to be largest  (Goldenson et al., 
2012) . Note that the CESM -CAM5 model has a particularly strong annual mean AA partly 
due to its very small global warming.

mean temperature change) AA for the BCx10 experiment, for all contributing models. [S] indicates models 
with effect of BC on snow/ice. These are marked with s olid lines , while dashed lines show models without 
the effect of BC on snow.  
 
There does not seem to be a systematic  difference in the seasonal AA cycle between the 
models with and without BC -on-snow treatment , except for a general tendency for higher 
AA in late fall/early winter . The exception is  CESM -CAM5 , which has a very strong BC -
induced amplification in spring/summer.  This is consistent with Qian et al. (2014) , who  
found that the Arctic forcing from BC on snow in the CAM5 model is substantial , and is at its 
maximum around mid-summer . There is a similar although weaker summertime maximum 
in NorESM1 , but n o such feature is discernible in MIROC -SPRINTARS.  However , due to the  
wide variety of parameterizations  and limited number of available models , these results 
should be interpreted with care . Further investigation of this effect requires more a 
dedicated stud y, where  a larger  number of model s perform sensitivity studies with and 
without the effect of BC on snow .  
 
4 Arctic precipitation responses to global perturbations  
In this section, we discuss the Arctic precipitation response to the five global pertur bations. 
As for temperature, we begin with the annual and seasonal mean responses and the impact 
of rapid adjustments. Then, we discuss precipitation change through the application of 
energy and moisture balance analyses.  
4.1  Annual ly and seasonally resolved precipitation responses  
While the Arctic surface  temperature  amplification has been thoroughly investigated, less 
attention has been given to changes in Arctic precipitation. Here we find that A rctic 
precipitation  change per degree  warming , often termed the apparent hydrological 
 
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  sensitivity  (HS), is similar ( 6-8 %/K) for all the global perturbations  (Fig. 1) . Samset et al. 
(2016)  analyzed the glob ally averaged precipitation c hange for the PDRMIP data set  and 
found a stronger apparent HS for changes in aerosols and solar insolation (around 3 %/K) 
than for greenhouse gas perturbations (around 2 %/K) . It was also found that the global 
average response  to BCx10 was negative  (i.e., a decrease) . The Arctic hydrological 
sensitivity is thus found to be stronger than the global averages, consistent with previous 
findings from simulations using the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios for a range of 
CMIP5 models (Bintanja and Selten, 2014) . Here, we are able to conclude that this is a 
robust feature among all drivers.  Testing the ten annual mean model values of SO 4-induced  
precipitation change against the other drivers using Student’s t -test we find that SO4 is 
associated with a slightly higher precipitation change, which is significantly (at the 95% 
level) different from the three other non -aerosol drivers.  
As trends in Ar ctic precipitation follows  the Arctic warming (Bintanja and Selten, 2014) , the 
seasonal variation in the change generally resembles that of the AA, with a maxim um in 
winter and smallest change during summer.  Deser et al. (2010)  performed idealized model 
experiments isolating the impact of future sea ice loss and found the same seasonality in sea 
ice and  precipitation  changes , indicating a close link. Our results also show  the strongest 
precipitation change s coincide nt with the regions of strongest warming (Fig. 2) and loss in 
sea ice (Fig. S 4), and we find that this  also is where surface evaporation increases the most 
(not shown). Th e seasonal cycle in precipitation changes is most similar between the non -
aerosol  drive rs (CO2x2, CH4x3 and SOL) . For BCx10 the changes are stronger in late 
winter/spring than in November/December . For SO4x5 there is no clear summer minimum , 
and SO4-induced precipitation changes in April through October are the highest of all 
drivers. All dr ivers have a strong relative increase in summertime convective precipitation 
(not shown), particularly over land, except fo r BC which causes a strong reduction  due to 
increased  stabilization connected with the strong upper -level warming shown in Fig. 4b. 
However, the Arctic summertime precipitation is dominated by stratiform precipitation 
formation, so changes in convective clouds play a smaller role in the  seasonal cycle of total 
precipitation . Instead, the seasonalit y can likely be attributed to seasonal variation in 
surface evaporation  or moisture transport .  
 
4.2  Separating Arctic precipitation amplification into rapid responses and feedbacks 
from global temperature change  
Like for temperature, we can separate the precipitation response into rapid adjustments 
and a slow change that scales with global mean surface temperature change. See Figure S 3. 
Here, the BC perturbation  produces precipitation response in the Arctic of opposit e sign 
from the global response  (Samset et al., 2016; Stjern et al., 2017) . Globally, the BC -induc ed 
drying has been shown to originate from the strong atmospheric absorption by the aerosols, 
which produces a very strong negative rapid adjustment that outweighs the final surface -
temperature driven increase (Andre ws et al., 2010; Kvalevåg et al., 2013; Samset et al.,  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  2016) . However, Samset et al. (2016)  demonstrated a regional dependency on the 
distribution between slow and fa st changes, with a dominance of the slow response 
(increasing precipitation) in the Arctic region.  This characteristic is confirmed in  Fig. S 3, 
where the rapid  precipitation response  for BCx10 is close to zero . 
 
4.3 Arctic precipitation changes through an energy balance perspective  
To understand the mechanisms behind the Arctic precipitation changes  for individual 
drivers , we utilize the energy budget approach (O’Gorman et al., 2011; Richard son et al., 
2016) . Wh en we calculate the atmospheric energy budget , contributions to the total 
precipitation change can be subdivided into changes in longwave atmospheric cooling LWC, 
shortwave atmospheric heating SWH, the net upward sensible heat at the surface, SH,  and 
the dry static energy flux divergence  Hdry: 
𝑳𝒅𝑷 =𝒅𝑳𝑾𝑪  – 𝒅𝑺𝑾𝑯  – 𝒅𝑺𝑯  + 𝒅𝑯 𝒅𝒓𝒚                (1) 
Above, L is the latent heat of condensation of water vapor  and P is the surface precipitation . 
The column -integrated dry static energy flux divergen ce change  dHdry is calculated as the 
residual between the preci pitation  change  LdP and the other terms , and contributes 
positively to precipitation change if more dry static energy  is transported out of  the Arctic 
atmospheric column in the perturbed climate . Alternatively, we may use a simplified 
moisture budget , following Bintanja and Selten (2014) :  
𝑳𝒅𝑷 =𝒅𝑬+ 𝒅𝑭 𝒎𝒐𝒊 𝒔𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆                 (2) 
Here, E denotes the evaporation  from the surface, and the transport of moist ure into the 
Arctic  (dFmois ture) is calculated as the difference between LdP and dE. 
The energy and moisture budget analys es of total Arctic precipitation changes are shown in 
Fig. 7a, again normalized by the global mean temperature change. Note that LdP indicates 
the total Arctic precipitation change per global warming, but in contrast to Fig. 1 , it shows  
model means (a s opposed to model medians)  and absolute changes (as opposed to relative 
changes) . This is necessary  to produce meaningful energy budget s and calculat e residuals  
but gives rise to some differences  between this figure and Fig. 1 . Immediately apparent 
from Fig. 7 a is how different the energy budget components are  for the global BC 
perturbation compared to the other drivers. Even so, the total precipitation change is 
similar between BC and the other drivers , as in Fig.1 .  
Short wave heating is shown with a negative prefix in Fig. 7a, since a reduction in short wave 
heating contributes to increased precipitation. For all drivers, this budget term is  negative, 
indicating  increases in short wave atmospheric heating.  In general, short wave heating  is 
driven by elevated  atmospheric water vapor concentrations in the warmer climate  (recall  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  that the sign of the SO 4 responses are turned in the normalization by the global mean 
temperature change) . However, due to  the strong additional absorption by atmos pheric BC 
particles, this term is by far strongest for BC . It is also stronger over land than over oceans 
(not shown ) where BC concentrations are highest . Changes in long wave co oling are positive 
for all driver s, again a s a general response to the warming  climate . The long wave cooling is  
strongest for BC  since  long wave radiation is re -emitted from high -altitude BC particles  after 
their absorption of solar radiation . The smaller long wave cooling of CO2x2 than SO4x4  is 
because in the Arctic, as opposed to  in the global average, the rapid response to an increase 
in CO 2 is a reduction in long wave cooling , which lowers its total increase . The sensible heat 
flux is affected by changes in the temperature difference between the surface and the 
overlaying air, as well as by changes in turbulen ce and convection.  Globally, the change in 
this quantity is minor  for all drivers but BC, as shown in a previous PDRMIP study (Myhre et 
al., 2018) . We find that this is true also in the Arctic . The strong atmospheric  warming 
caused by BC (Fig. 4 ) leads to a marked  reduction in the sensible heat flux , which is stronger 
over land than over oceans . Finally, all drivers cause an increase  in the dry static energy flux 
divergence. This term is negative (indicating energy transport into the Arctic) in the baseline 
climate but slightly less negative in t he perturbed climate, meaning that  the poleward 
energy transport  is reduced. This is a natural consequence of the Arctic amplification, by 
which the high latitudes warm more than the lower latitudes and the meridional 
temperature gradient is reduced. For all drivers, but especially for BC, the reduced dry static 
energy  flux diver gence  is strongest in the summer season (not shown) . 
Previous studies highlight the role of moisture transport from lower latitudes to Arctic 
precipitation changes (Bengtsson et al., 2011; Kug et al., 2010) . Still, in dications from both 
observations (Kattsov and Wals h, 2000)  and model simulations (Bintanja and Selten, 2014)  
are that the dominating cause of the precipitation change may be the strong intensification 
of local surface evaporation . Here, we find that the change in moisture transport  (dF moisture ) 
is of similar magnitude as  increased evaporation ( dE) for CO2x2, CH4x3 and SOL . For SO 4, 
contribution from evaporation  is higher than that from moisture transport  and for BC there 
is a statistically significant higher impact from the latter , whereas the evaporation change  is 
negligible . This means that the dominating processes behind Arctic precipitation changes 
may shift depending on what climate driver has the dominating impact in the Arctic.  
We next  examine the  seasonal variations in the dFmoisture  and dE terms, and their 
contribution  to the  total  precipitation change . In Fig. 7 b the seasonal absolute change in 
precipitation is shown as a solid black line  and t he monthly contribution of evaporation and 
moisture transport changes to this precipitation change is indicated by the bars. Fo r CO2x2, 
CH4x3, SOL and SO4x5 , the  increase in surface evaporation is greatest in June, with a 
secondary maximum in late fall/early winter.  BC, on the other hand, causes a small increase 
in evaporation in all seasons except  summer, when  there is a notable  reduction . This is 
when available incoming solar radiation and enhanced BC concentrations combine to 
produce the seasonally strongest reduction in the amount of short -wave radiation that  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  reaches the surface, an effect known as solar dimming . For BC, the moisture transport term 
is much larger than for the other drivers, and it is the dominant cause of the BC -induced 
Arctic precipitation changes. During winter, the relative importance of evaporation and 
moisture transport changes for SO 4 are com parable to the other (non -BC) drivers , while 
evaporation changes dominate in the summer . Recall, however, that the sign is turned by 
the normalization by a negative global mean temperature change. In reality, increased 
concentrations of SO4 causes reduced moisture transport and evaporation throughout the 
year, but like for BC, there is a particularly strong  reduction in  evaporation in the summer 
months  due to  enhanced  solar dimming. Conversely, CO 2 induces  the weakest evaporation 
change of all the drivers  in this season  due to a negative rapid response (not shown) that 
lowers the total positive change . These differences explain the stronger precipitation -
response to SO 4 than to the other non -aerosol drivers, as shown in Fig. 1. 
 
Figure 7. a) Model mean atmospheric energy budget and moisture budget analysis for the Arctic, 
normalized by global mean temperature change. The sign convention is such that positive values indicate 
 
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  that the term contributes to increased precipitation. LdP is the total precipitat ion change. Components of 
the energy budget are shown in between the two vertical lines, where dLWC is the change in longwave 
atmospheric cooling, dSWH is the change in shortwave atmospheric heating, dSH is the change in 
sensible heat at the surface and dH dry is the change in dry static energy flux divergence. Components of 
the moisture budget are at the rightmost side, where dE is change in surface evaporation and dF moisture  is 
moisture transport into the Arctic. Vertical lines show the inter -model standar d deviation. b) Contribution 
of the moisture budget terms to the absolute monthly precipitation change.  
 
For all drivers we find a maximum change in poleward moisture transport around  August 
through October . This summer/autumn maximum is likely a contributing cause for the 
strong seasonal upper -level warming for BC , for which the moisture transport term is 
particularly strong . Moisture from lower latitudes can be a source of heat within the Arctic, 
in the fo rm of latent heat release, increased water vapor greenhouse effect or changes to 
clouds.  Sedlar and Tjernström (2017)  found a clear pattern of increased lower -level and 
decrease d upper -level clouds in months with particularly strong moisture a dvection into the 
Arctic, similar to the cloud change pattern we see during summer for BCx10 (Fig. 5).  
We note for consistency that Bintanja and Selten (2014)  found  strongest late-century 
increases in moisture transport in summer /early autumn  for a range of CMIP5 models under 
the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5  emission scenarios . The later seasonal maximum in our data is 
related to our broad definition of the Arctic  as all area north of 60° N: using  70°N instead  
shifts  the maximum transport change towards mid-summer (see Fig. S 7). 
 
5 Arctic  responses to regional perturbations  
Seven of the ten models performed additional simulations , where BC was  perturb ed in a 
subregion of  Asia and SO 4 was perturbed in parts of Asia and Europe  (see Section 2 for 
detailed description of these regions) . Two of these models ran emission -based simulations , 
leading to additional model differences due to differences in  transport, wet removal and 
other processe s. The remaining five used concentration -based set -ups, which diminishes the 
sources for model differences , and allows for more focus on dynamical responses . Given 
these differences , we have here chosen to present the concentration -based and the 
emission -based results separately, even if the latter will only show the mean of two models.  
Figure 8 shows the equivalent of Fig. 1, where solid and hatched bars represent  global and 
regional perturbations, respectively, but for the subset of five  concentration -based models 
in Fig. 8a and two emission -based in Fig. 8b.   
Starting with the concentration -driven  models, we find that t he Asian BC perturbation 
produces a stronger Arctic amplification , as well as a stronger precipitation response, than 
the global perturbation. This contrasts the response to the regional SO 4 perturbations,  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  which both cause an AA more like the global experiment . There is a tendency for a stronger 
AA and stronger precipitation response from the European than from the Asian SO 4 
perturbation, but the difference s are not statistically significant.  Figure 9 a shows vertical AA 
profiles by latitude north, similar to Fig. 4 a, for the concentration -driven models . The 
warming pattern for BCx10asia is more focused around the latitudes o f the regional 
emissions (around 40°N), but otherwise resembles  the global pattern. The AA signal s from 
the regional SO 4 perturbation s have much clearer maxima over the emission latitudes than 
the global signal, but as opposed to the regional BC perturbation they do not show the same 
clear poleward extension of the AA.  
The two emission -driven models (Fig. 8b) have stronger AA than the concentrat ion-driven 
models, both for the global and the regional experiments. As mentioned  in Section 2, 
emission -driven models have the potential for an amplified  or dampened  response since  the 
model’s climate response may feed back on the BC concentrations , as found in Sand et al. 
(2015) . Notably , while regional BC perturbations caused stronger AA  than global for the 
concentration -driven models, the opposite is true for the emission -driven , due to a very 
strong AA for the global perturbation. However, this  includes results from  NCAR -CAM5 , 
which was seen to be an outlier (Fig. 1 ). With the exception of the BCx10 experiment, the 
AA responses of the two individual emission -driven models a re very similar  (note the circles 
in the figure, indicating individual model values) .

change) to global (solid bars) versus regional (hatched bars) perturbations in BC and SO 4, averaged over

show annual model median values, individual model values are shown as circles. Horizontal bars indicate 
± one standard deviation, and triangles are used to indicate when standard deviations are outside the 
range of the axes limits.  
 
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  While the concentration -driven models had no discernible AA difference between the two 
regional SO 4 perturbations, the tenfold increase in SO 4 in Europe causes a significantly 
stronger AA than a tenfold increase in Asia  for the emission -driven models . This difference is 
particularly clear in the summ ertime, while wint ertime responses are more similar  (not 
shown) . The similarity in wintertime responses can be explained by that fact that d uring 
winter, Europe and  Eurasia are both located within the polar d ome ( i.e., the surfaces of 
constant potential temperature) . This, and the fact that parts of these regions are covered 
in snow in winter, which cools the near -surface air and eases transport into the polar dome,  
allows air masses from both these regions to reach the Arctic through l ow-level transport 
(Stohl, 2006) . Air masses that are too warm (i.e., air originating from lower latitudes in 
summer)  for isentropic transport reach the Arctic through lifting outside the polar dome and 
may subsequently slowly d escen d within. Indeed, c omparing seasonal vertical warming 
patterns between the European and the Asian SO 4 perturbations in Fig. S6, we see that 
while the summertime Arctic response to SO 4 perturbations in the (warmer , more remote  
and with more effective convective lifting ) Asian region  is mostly confined to the mid -
troposphere, the impact from European SO 4 extends all the way to the surface.  This 
produces notable differences in surface AA (Fig. 8b) between the two experiments. A 
wintertime warming , on the other hand, is visible at the Arctic surface in both the European 
and the Asian SO 4 perturbation experiment s. The Europe -only perturbation also y ields a 
higher precipitation response than the Asian -only perturbation.

to 90 °N and for the model median on a) five concentration -based models and b) two emission -based 
models. Hatching indicates where fewer than 75 % of the models agree on the sign of the change.  
 
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  Our findings for the emission -driven models , that Arctic temperature and precipitation 
responses are significantly  stronger for the Europ ean than for Asian  perturbations , are in 
line with previous findings (Aamaas et al., 2016; Bellou in et al., 2016; Sand et al., 2016; 
Stjern et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2013) . For instance , Sand et al. (2016)  shows that Europe and 
Russia are the regions that influence Arctic temperatures th e most per unit emissions , and  
the large sulfate emission change  in Europe over the past decades  have been linked to 
changes  in Arctic sea ice cover (Acosta Navarro et al., 2016; Gagné et al., 2017; Mueller et 
al., 2018) . The greater  impact of European emissions  is likely due to factors connected with 
the nearer proximity of Europe to the Arctic, but may also be related to a saturation of 
aerosol -cloud interactions over East Asia, as well as a greater climatological cloud cover, 
which could mask the direct aerosol forcing in that region (Kasoar et al., 2018) . In another 
PDRMIP  analysis Liu et al. (2018)  also found  that the forcing from European SO 4 increases 
had a stronger efficacy in terms of global temperatures and precipitation effects than that 
from the Asian region. In the present study we find the concentration -based models do not 
show this difference , at l east in the Arctic . However, the regional PDRMIP simulations is 
limited in terms of number of regions, making it difficult  to confidently conclude on regional 
impacts on Arctic climate.  
 
6 Discussion  
Common for the Arctic impact  studies mentioned in the previous section  is that they focus 
on responses per unit emissions . In reality , SO2 emissions in Europe are relatively low  today , 
while SO 2 emissions in India are currently increasing strongly  (Li et al., 2017) . Sand et al. 
(2016)  stress that due to the large absolute emissions of SLCF (particularly BC) from the 
Asian continent, this is presently the largest source of SLCF -driven Arctic warming – both 
due to long -range transport and  due to  localized radiative impact and subsequent transport 
of heat and moisture. However, large emission changes in this  region are ongoing (van der A 
et al., 2017) . Recent studies suggest that emissions of sulfur dioxide in China has decreased 
by 75 % over the past decade and that India is taking over as the lar gest single -region 
emitter (Li et al., 2017) . In contrast, emissions of BC and CO 2 have continued to increase in 
both regions (e.g., Hoesly et al., 2017) . Persad and Caldeira (2018)  looked at impacts from 
anthropogenic aerosol (including both SO 4 and BC) changes in a range of regions, using the 
NCAR -CAM5 model , and found substantial variations in how emissions from different 
regions influence the global temperature. They found that regions which historically or 
presently account for the majority of anthropogenic aerosol emissions have the largest 
impacts on temperature , while regions where emissions currently have or are projected to 
have strong tr ends (i.e., India or East Africa)  have smaller temperature impacts.  This 
suggests that, globally averaged, the future distribution of main emission regions may have 
a smaller cooling potential than historically.  Importantly, however,  one reason for the sma ll 
global temperature impact of Indian emissions was a regionally heterogeneous pattern of  
 
© 2019 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.  both positive and negative temperature responses. And while increased aerosol emissions 
in general cause a cooling, the Arctic response to Indian emission changes in this study was 
a warming.   
Energy and moisture transport from lower latitudes play an important role in the impact on 
Arctic climate. Recent research ha s looked closer into how poleward energy tr ansport  
contributes to current and future AA, and to how it will react to the reduced meridional 
temperature gradient  following an AA  (Graversen, 2006; Jonas et al., 2016; Kapsch et al., 
2013) . They find that it is the transport of latent heat, and not of dry -static energy, that 
dominates the contribution t o AA. As for future changes in these energy transport terms, 
simulations show that while models do not agree on the sign of the change in the total 
poleward heat transport, they all predict a reduction in the dry static energy transport (as 
the faster Arct ic warming reduces the temperature gradient between high and low 
latitudes), and an increase in the latent heat transport (Hwang et al., 2011) . Here, we find 
that the contribution from the dry -static energy flux divergence to the Arctic precipitation 
change differs between climate drivers, but is particularly important for BC. It is however 
positive for all drivers and all individual models, indicating a r eduction in northward energy 
transport . We  also find , for all drivers,  an increase in the northward transport of moisture, 
consistent with Hwang et al. (2011) . We note that t he o cean has been shown to play an 
important role in the poleward heat transport (Nummelin et al., 2017) , but here , we have 
not looked at changes in this component. A separate study investigating how  different 
climate drivers influence the various elements of the poleward energy tr ansport could 
improve our ability to predict how the Arctic would respond to future emission and climate 
changes.  
Many of the processes involved when simulating climate resp onses in the Arctic are 
associated with high levels of uncertainty. One example  is the effect of BC aerosols on ice 
and snow , with estimates ranging from  relatively  weak (Bond et al., 2013)  to strong er 
(Flanner et al., 2007)  effects. Here, three of the contributi ng models (NorESM1, CESM -CAM5  
and MIROC -SPRINTARS ) include estimates of the radiative effect of BC on snow in their 
models , but in only one of these (CESM -CAM5) do we see a clear signal from this effect in 
the seasonal  warming in the Arctic. Differences in how models treat processes such as BC on  
snow nevertheless contributes to be a source of uncertainty and deviations between 
models. Previous multi -model studies have found that the spread in model responses is 
particularly large in the Arctic (Sand et al., 2017) , and this is also the case here: Table S3 
shows that the inter -model standard deviation for both temperature and precipitation is 
typically a factor three or more larger in the Arctic than gl obally.

The Arctic is influenced by both local and remote emissions (Acosta Navarro et al., 2016; 
Gagné et al., 2017) . Presently, global and regional trends  in emissions are shifting rapidly.  
While global CO 2 emissions are still increasing (Le Quéré et al., 2018) , there are significant 
regional differences in air pollutant trends (Hoesly et a l., 2017; Li et al., 2017) . Combined 
with underlying climate change, potentially affecting transport pathways (Jiao and Flanner, 
2016) , this may shift the relative importance of individual climate drivers for Arctic climate 
change. Moreover, a erosol emissions  in individual regions may have a different impact on 
Arctic climate t o global perturbations.  
The present study analyzes the response of perturbations to five individual climate drivers  
(CO 2, CH 4, the solar constant, SO 4 and BC) , investigating effects on Arctic temperature and 
precipitation . While some notable differences exist, particularly for BC, response patterns in 
the vertical temperature profile are broadly similar between climate drivers. The Ar ctic 
amplification in surface temperature ranges only from 1.9 [± 0.4] (SOL) to 2.3  [± 0.6 ] (SO4x5) 
between drivers , and inter -driver differences are not statistically significant . As indicated in 
previous studies, the majority of the Arctic response seems  to originate from a generalized 
dynamical response to the climate warming. This is also reflected in the present analysis 
through the  similar surface Arctic amplification (AA) pattern across  all drivers and in the fact 
that all drivers cause the strongest surface warming in winter. All drivers  display  a similar 
pattern of upper -level (~400 hPa) AA in the summer , and a reduction in cloud cover in the 
same altitude and season . For BC, we see  a much stronger upper -level AA than for the other 
climate drivers . This is likely connected to increased high -level concentrations of BC in 
summer, as well as a very strong BC-induced summertime increase in poleward moisture 
transport, which may induce additional warming through short wave absorption by BC 
particles and an added water vapor greenhouse effect. T his warming does not propagate 
down to the Arctic surface. A stronger increase in summertime low cloud cover (which tend s 
to cool the surface)  for the BC perturbations may instead act as a buffering effect, so that all 
climate drivers end up causing relatively similar surface AA, with maxima in winter and 
minima in summer . 
Global temperature change -normalized p recipitation responses are also relatively similar 
between drivers, although less so than for temperature. SO 4 cause s significantly stronger  
(normalized)  precipitation increases than the other non -aerosol  drivers , driven by a much 
stronger evaporation change . This difference is particularly pronounced in the summer. An 
energy budget break -down of the contribution of different processes to the precipitation 
change shows that the BC response is substantially stronger than those of the other climate 
drivers in in all these processes. In total, however, the different contributions cancel out to 
leave a precipitation change similar to that from the other climate drivers.  While changes in 
poleward moisture transport and changes in evaporation have similar contribution s to the 
total precipitation change for CO2x2, CH4x3 and SOL, the aerosol -driven precipitation

dominance of evaporation changes for SO4x4.  
Our study present s a first, comprehensive overview of how Arctic temperature and 
precipitation responds to individual climate drivers. While further analysis is needed to fully 
disentangle all the processes that act to shape the Arctic climate response, we conclude that 
overall, responses are similar enough to provide confidence in scenario -based projections 
for Arctic climate change regardless of the detailed balance between components of future 
emissions.

Table S1. Overview of models included in the study . Models driven by fixed concentrations in 
the aerosol experiments are marked by a subfix [C] while the emission -driven models are 
marked with [E]  (MPI -ESM did not perform the aerosol experiments and is therefore marked as 
neither) . An asterisk means that i ndirect aerosol effects of BC aerosols are not included in the 
model’s microphysical scheme.
