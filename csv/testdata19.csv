Climate forcing growth rates: doubling
down on our Faustian bargain
James Hansen,
Pushker Kharecha andMakiko Sato
Goddard Institute for Space
Studies and Columbia EarthInstitute, 2880 Broadway,New York, NY 10025, USAjames.e.hansen@nasa.govRahmstorf et al ’s (2012 ) conclusion that observed climate change is comparable
to projections, and in some cases exceeds projections, allows further inferences ifwe can quantify changing climate forcings and compare those with projections.The largest climate forcing is caused by well-mixed long-lived greenhouse gases.Here we illustrate trends of these gases and their climate forcings, and we discussimplications. We focus on quantities that are accurately measured, and we includecomparison with ﬁxed scenarios, which helps reduce common misimpressionsabout how climate forcings are changing.
Annual fossil fuel CO
2emissions have shot up in the past decade at about
3% yr−1, double the rate of the prior three decades (ﬁgure 1). The growth rate
falls above the range of the IPCC ( 2001 ) ‘Marker’ scenarios, although emissions
are still within the entire range considered by the IPCC SRES ( 2000 ). The surge
in emissions is due to increased coal use (blue curve in ﬁgure 1), which now
accounts for more than 40% of fossil fuel CO 2emissions.
The resulting annual increase of atmospheric CO 2(12-month running mean)
has grown from less than 1 ppm yr−1in the early 1960s to an average
∼2 ppm yr−1in the past decade (ﬁgure 2). Although CO 2measurements were not
made at sufﬁcient locations prior to the early 1980s to calculate the global meanchange, the close match of global and Mauna Loa data for later years suggeststhat Mauna Loa data provide a good approximation of global change (ﬁgure 2),
thus allowing a useful estimate of annual global change beginning with theinitiation of Mauna Loa measurements in 1958 by Keeling et al (1973 ).
Interannual variability of CO
2growth is correlated with ENSO (El Nino
Southern Oscillation) variations of tropical temperatures (ﬁgure 2).
Ocean–atmosphere CO 2exchange is affected by ENSO (Chavez et al 1999 ), but
ENSO seems to have a greater impact on atmospheric CO 2via the terrestrial
carbon cycle through effects on the water cycle, temperature, and ﬁre, asdiscussed in a large body of literature (referenced, e.g., by Schwalm et al 2011 ).
In addition, volcanoes, such as the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, slow theincrease of atmospheric CO
2(Rothenberg et al 2012 ), at least in part because
photosynthesis is enhanced by the increased proportion of diffuse sunlight (Guet al 2003 , Mercado et al 2009 ). Watson ( 1997 ) suggests that volcanic dust
deposited on the ocean surface may also contribute to CO
2uptake by increasing
ocean productivity.
An important question is whether ocean and terrestrial carbon sinks will tend
to saturate as human-made CO 2emissions continue. Piao et al (2008 ) and Zhao
and Running ( 2010 ) suggest that there already may be a reduction of terrestrial
carbon uptake, while Le Qu ´er´eet al (2007 ) and Schuster and Watson ( 2007 ) ﬁnd
evidence of decreased carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean and North AtlanticOcean, respectively. However, others (Knorr 2009 , Sarmiento et al 2010 ,

Ballantyne et al 2012 ) either cast doubt on the reality of a reduced uptake
strength or ﬁnd evidence for increased uptake.
An informative presentation of CO 2observations is the ratio of annual CO 2
increase in the air divided by annual fossil fuel CO 2emissions (Keeling et al
1973 ), the ‘airborne fraction’ (ﬁgure 3, right scale). An alternative deﬁnition of
airborne fraction includes in the denominator of this ratio an estimated netanthropogenic CO
2source from changes in land use, but this latter term is much
more uncertain than the two terms involved in the Keeling et al (1973 ) deﬁnition.
For example, analysis by Harris et al (2012 ) reveals a range as high as a factor of
2–4 in estimates of recent land use emissions; see also the discussion bySarmiento et al (2010 ). However, note that the airborne fraction becomes smaller
when estimated land use emissions are included, with the uptake fraction (oneminus airborne fraction) typically greater than 0.5.

Figure 3. Fossil fuel CO 2emissions (left scale) and airborne fraction, i.e., the ratio of observed
atmospheric CO 2increase to fossil fuel CO 2emissions. Final three points are 5-, 3- and 1-year means.
The simple Keeling airborne fraction, clearly, is not increasing (ﬁgure 3). Thus
the net ocean plus terrestrial sink for carbon emissions has increased by a factorof 3–4 since 1958, accommodating the emissions increase by that factor.
Remarkably, and we will argue importantly, the airborne fraction has declined
since 2000 (ﬁgure 3) during a period without any large volcanic eruptions. The
7-year running mean of the airborne fraction had remained close to 60% up to2000, except for the period affected by Pinatubo. The airborne fraction is affectedby factors other than the efﬁciency of carbon sinks, most notably by changes inthe rate of fossil fuel emissions (Gloor et al 2010 ). However, it is the dependence
of the airborne fraction on fossil fuel emission rate that makes the post-2000downturn of the airborne fraction particularly striking. The change of emissionrate in 2000 from 1 .5% yr
−1to 3 .1% yr−1(ﬁgure 1), other things being equal,
would have caused a sharp increase of the airborne fraction (the simple reasonbeing that a rapid source increase provides less time for carbon to be moveddownward out of the ocean’s upper layers).
A decrease in land use emissions during the past decade (Harris et al 2012 )
could contribute to the decreasing airborne fraction in ﬁgure 3, although Malhi
(2010 ) presents evidence that tropical forest deforestation and regrowth are
approximately in balance, within uncertainties. Land use change can be only apartial explanation for the decrease of the airborne fraction; something more thanland use change seems to be occurring.
We suggest that the huge post-2000 increase of uptake by the carbon sinks
implied by ﬁgure 3is related to the simultaneous sharp increase in coal use
(ﬁgure 1). Increased coal use occurred primarily in China and India (Boden et al
2012 ;B P 2012 ; see graphs at www.columbia.edu/ ∼mhs119/Emissions/Emis
moreFigs/ ). Satellite radiance measurements for July–December, months when
desert dust does not dominate aerosol amount, yield an increase of aerosol opticaldepth in East Asia of about 4% yr
−1during 2000–2006 (van Donkelaar et al
2008 ). Associated gaseous and particulate emissions increased rapidly after 2000
in China and India (Lu et al 2011 , Tian et al 2010 ). Some decrease of the sulfur
component of emissions occurred in China after 2006 as wide application ofﬂue-gas desulfurization began to be initiated (Lu et al 2010 ), but this was largely
offset by continuing emission increases from India (Lu et al 2011 ).
We suggest that the surge of fossil fuel use, mainly coal, since 2000 is a basic
cause of the large increase of carbon uptake by the combined terrestrial and oceancarbon sinks. One mechanism by which fossil fuel emissions increase carbonuptake is by fertilizing the biosphere via provision of nutrients essential for tissuebuilding, especially nitrogen, which plays a critical role in controlling net primaryproductivity and is limited in many ecosystems (Gruber and Galloway 2008 ).
Modeling (e.g., Thornton et al 2009 ) and ﬁeld studies (Magnani et al 2007 )

Figure 4. Observed atmospheric CH 4amount and scenarios for twenty ﬁrst century. Alternative
scenario (Hansen et al 2000 , Hansen and Sato 2004 ) yields maximum global warming ∼1.5◦C above

relative to values in 2000 (Hansen et al 2007 ).
conﬁrm a major role of nitrogen deposition, working in concert with CO 2
fertilization, in causing a large increase in net primary productivity of temperate
and boreal forests. Sulfate aerosols from coal burning also might increase carbonuptake by increasing the proportion of diffuse insolation, as noted above forPinatubo aerosols, even though the total solar radiation reaching the surface isreduced.
Thus we see the decreased CO
2airborne fraction since 2000 as sharing some
of the same causes as the decreased airborne fraction after the Pinatubo eruption(ﬁgure 3). CO
2fertilization is likely the major effect, as a plausible addition of
5 TgN yr−1from fossil fuels and net ecosystem productivity of 200 kgC kgN−1
(Magnani et al 2007 ,2008 ) yields an annual carbon drawdown of 1 GtC yr−1,
which is of the order of what is needed to explain the post-2000 anomaly inairborne CO
2. However, an aerosol-induced increase of diffuse radiation might
also contribute. Although tropospheric aerosol properties are not accuratelymonitored, there are suggestions of an upward trend of stratospheric backgroundaerosols since 2000 (Hofmann et al 2009 , Solomon et al 2011 ), which could be a
consequence of more tropospheric aerosols at low latitudes where injection oftropospheric air into the stratosphere occurs (Holton et al 1995 ). We discuss
climate implications of the reduced CO
2airborne fraction after presenting data
for other greenhouse gases.
Atmospheric CH 4is increasing more slowly than in IPCC scenarios (ﬁgure 4),
which were deﬁned more than a decade ago (IPCC 2001 ). However, after
remaining nearly constant for several years, CH 4has increased during the past
ﬁve years, pushing slightly above the level that was envisaged in the AlternativeScenario of Hansen et al (2000 ). Reduction of CH
4, besides slowdown in CO 2
growth in the twenty ﬁrst century and a decline of CO 2in the twenty second
century, is a principal requirement to achieve a low climate forcing that stabilizesclimate, in part because CH
4also affects tropospheric ozone and stratospheric
water vapor. The Alternative Scenario, deﬁned in detail by Hansen and Sato(2004 ), keeps maximum global warming at ∼1.5
◦C relative to 1880–1920, under
the assumption that fast-feedback climate sensitivity is ∼3◦C for doubled CO 2
(Hansen et al 2007 ). The Alternative Scenario allows CO 2to reach 475 ppm in
2100 before declining slowly; this scenario assumes that reductions of non-CO 2
greenhouse gases and black carbon aerosols can be achieved sufﬁcient to balancethe warming effect of likely future decreases of reﬂective aerosols.
There are anthropogenic sources of CH
4that potentially could be reduced,
indeed, the leveling off of CH 4amount during the past 20 years seems to have

update of ﬁgure 4 of Hansen and Sato ( 2004 ). Forcing calculations use equations of Hansen et al

gas results equally and thus do not alter the conclusion that the actual forcing falls below that of the
IPCC scenarios.
been caused by decreased venting in oil ﬁelds (Simpson et al 2012 ), but the
feasibility of overall CH 4reduction also depends on limiting global warming
itself, because of the potential for amplifying climate-CH 4feedbacks (Archer
et al 2009 , Koven et al 2011 ). Furthermore, reduction of atmospheric CH 4might
become problematic if unconventional mining of gas, such as ‘hydro-fracking’,expands widely (Cipolla 2009 ), as discussed further below.
The growth rate for the total climate forcing by well-mixed greenhouse gases
has remained below the peak values reached in the 1970s and early 1980s, hasbeen relatively stable for about 20 years, and is falling below IPCC ( 2001 )
scenarios (ﬁgure 5). However, the greenhouse gas forcing is growing faster than
in the Alternative Scenario. MPTGs and OTGs in ﬁgure 5are Montreal Protocol
Trace Gases and Other Trace Gases (Hansen and Sato 2004 ).
If greenhouse gases were the only climate forcing, we would be tempted to
infer from Rahmstorf’s conclusion (that actual climate change has exceededIPCC projections) and our conclusion (that actual greenhouse gas forcings areslightly smaller than IPCC scenarios) that actual climate sensitivity is on the highside of what has generally been assumed. Although that may be a valid inference,the evidence is weakened by the fact that other climate forcings are not negligiblein comparison to the greenhouse gases and must be accounted for.
Natural forcings, by changing solar irradiance and volcanic aerosols, are
well-measured since the late 1970s and included in most IPCC ( 2007 ) climate
simulations. The difﬁculty is human-made aerosols. Aerosols are readily detectedin satellite observations, but determination of their climate forcing requiresaccurate knowledge of changes in aerosol amount, size distribution, absorptionand vertical distribution on a global basis—as well as simultaneous data onchanges in cloud properties to allow inference of the indirect aerosol forcing viainduced cloud changes. Unfortunately, the ﬁrst satellite mission capable ofmeasuring the needed aerosol characteristics (Aerosol Polarimetry Sensor on theGlory satellite, (Mishchenko et al 2007 )) suffered a launch failure and as yet there
are no concrete plans for a replacement mission.
The human-made aerosol climate forcing thus remains uncertain. IPCC ( 2007 )
concludes that aerosols are a negative (cooling) forcing, probably between −0.5
and−2.5Wm
−2. Hansen et al (2011 ), based mainly on analysis of Earth’s
energy imbalance, derive an aerosol forcing −1.6±0.3Wm−2, consistent with
an analysis of Murphy et al (2009 ) that suggests an aerosol forcing about
−1.5Wm−2(see discussion in Hansen et al (2011 )). This large negative aerosol
forcing reduces the net climate forcing of the past century by about half (IPCC2007 ; ﬁgure 1 of Hansen et al 2011 ). Coincidentally, this leaves net climate
forcing comparable to the CO
2forcing alone.

Figure 6. Fossil fuel CO 2emissions and carbon content (1 ppm atmospheric CO 2∼2.12 GtC).
Historical emissions are from Boden et al (2012 ). Estimated reserves and potentially recoverable
resources are based on energy content values of Energy Information Administration (EIA 2011 ),
German Advisory Council (GAC 2011 ), and Global Energy Assessment (GEA 2012 ). We convert
energy content to carbon content using emission factors of Table 4.2 of IPCC ( 2007 ) for coal, gas, and
conventional oil, and, following IPCC, we use an emission factor of unconventional oil the same as thatfor coal.
Reduction of the net human-made climate forcing by aerosols has been
described as a ‘Faustian bargain’ (Hansen and Lacis 1990 , Hansen 2009 ), because
the aerosols constitute deleterious particulate air pollution. Reduction of the netclimate forcing by half will continue only if we allow air pollution to build up togreater and greater amounts. More likely, humanity will demand and achieve areduction of particulate air pollution, whereupon, because the CO
2from fossil
fuel burning remains in the surface climate system for millennia, the ‘devil’spayment’ will be extracted from humanity via increased global warming.
So is the new data we present here good news or bad news, and how does it
alter the ‘Faustian bargain’? At ﬁrst glance there seems to be some good news.First, if our interpretation of the data is correct, the surge of fossil fuel emissions,especially from coal burning, along with the increasing atmospheric CO
2level is
‘fertilizing’ the biosphere, and thus limiting the growth of atmospheric CO 2.
Also, despite the absence of accurate global aerosol measurements, it seems thatthe aerosol cooling effect is probably increasing based on evidence of aerosolincreases in the Far East and increasing ‘background’ stratospheric aerosols.
Both effects work to limit global warming and thus help explain why the rate
of global warming seems to be less this decade than it has been during the priorquarter century. This data interpretation also helps explain why multiple warningsthat some carbon sinks are ‘drying up’ and could even become carbon sources,e.g., boreal forests infested by pine bark beetles (Kurz et al 2008 ) and the
Amazon rain forest suffering from drought (Lewis et al 2011 ), have not produced
an obvious impact on atmospheric CO
2.
However, increased CO 2uptake does not necessarily mean that the biosphere
is healthier or that the increased carbon uptake will continue indeﬁnitely (Matsonet al 2002 , Galloway et al 2002 , Heimann and Reichstein 2008 , Gruber and
Galloway 2008 ). Nor does it change the basic facts about the potential magnitude
of the fossil fuel carbon source (ﬁgure 6) and the long lifetime of the CO
2in the
surface carbon reservoirs (atmosphere, ocean, soil, biosphere) once the fossilfuels are burned (Archer 2005 ). Fertilization of the biosphere affects the
distribution of the fossil fuel carbon among these reservoirs, at least on the shortrun, but it does not alter the fact that the fossil carbon will remain in thesereservoirs for millennia.
Humanity, so far, has burned only a small portion (purple area in ﬁgure 6)o f
total fossil fuel reserves and resources. Yet deleterious effects of warming areapparent (IPCC 2007 ), even though only about half of the warming due to gases
6Environ. Res. Lett. 8(2013) 011006 Perspective
now in the air has appeared, the remainder still ‘in the pipeline’ due to the inertia
of the climate system (Hansen et al 2011 ). Already it seems difﬁcult to avoid
passing the ‘guardrail’ of no more than 2◦C global warming that was agreed in
the Copenhagen Accord of the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change (UNFCCC 2010 ). And Hansen et al (2008 ), based primarily on
paleoclimate data and evidence of deleterious climate impacts already at 385 ppmCO
2, concluded that an appropriate initial target for CO 2was 350 ppm, which
implied a global temperature limit, relative to 1880–1920 of about 1◦C. What is
clear is that most of the remaining fossil fuels must be left in the ground if we areto avoid dangerous human-made interference with climate.
The principal implication of our present analysis probably relates to the
Faustian bargain. Increased short-term masking of greenhouse gas warming byfossil fuel particulate and nitrogen pollution represents a ‘doubling down’ of theFaustian bargain, an increase in the stakes. The more we allow the Faustian debtto build, the more unmanageable the eventual consequences will be. Yet globallythere are plans to build more than 1000 coal-ﬁred power plants (Yang and Cui2012 ) and plans to develop some of the dirtiest oil sources on the planet (EIA
2011 ). These plans should be vigorously resisted. We are already in a deep
hole—it is time to stop digging.
