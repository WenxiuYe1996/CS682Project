Abstract 31
The methods to quantify equilibrium climate sensitivity are still debated. We collect 32
millennial-length simulations of coupled climate models and show that the global mean equi- 33
librium warming is higher than those obtained using extrapolation methods from shorter 34
simulations. Specically, 27 simulations with 15 climate models forced with a range of CO 2 35
concentrations show a median 17% larger equilibrium warming than estimated from the rst 36
150 years of the simulations. The spatial patterns of radiative feedbacks change continu- 37
ously, in most regions reducing their tendency to stabilizing the climate. In the equatorial 38
Pacic, however, feedbacks become more stabilizing with time. The global feedback evo- 39
lution is initially dominated by the tropics, with eventual substantial contributions from 40
the mid-latitudes. Time-dependent feedbacks underscore the need of a measure of climate 41
sensitivity that accounts for the degree of equilibration, so that models, observations, and 42
paleo proxies can be adequately compared and aggregated to estimate future warming. 43
1 Estimating equilibrium climate sensitivity 44
The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is dened as the global- and time-mean, 45
surface air warming once radiative equilibrium is reached in response to doubling the atmo- 46
spheric CO 2concentration above pre-industrial levels. It is by far the most commonly and 47
continuously applied concept to assess our understanding of the climate system as simulated 48
in climate models and it is used to compare models, observations, and paleo-proxies (Knutti 49
et al., 2017; Charney et al., 1979; Houghton et al., 1990; Stocker, 2013). Due to the large 50
heat capacity of the oceans, the climate system takes millennia to equilibrate to a forcing, 51
but performing such a long simulation with a climate model is often computationally not 52
feasible. As a result, many modeling studies use extrapolation methods on short, typically 53
150-year long, simulations to project equilibrium conditions (Taylor et al., 2011; Andrews 54
et al., 2012; Collins et al., 2013; Otto et al., 2013; Lewis & Curry, 2015; Andrews et al., 55
2015; Forster, 2016; Calel & Stainforth, 2017). These so-called eective climate sensitiv- 56
ities (Murphy, 1995; Gregory et al., 2004) are often reported as ECS values (Hargreaves 57
& Annan, 2016; Tian, 2015; Brient & Schneider, 2016; Forster, 2016). Research provides 58
evidence for decadal-to-centennial changes of feedbacks (e.g., Murphy (1995); Senior and 59
Mitchell (2000); Gregory et al. (2004); Winton et al. (2010); Armour et al. (2013); Prois- 60
tosescu and Huybers (2017); Paynter et al. (2018)) but the behavior on longer timescales has 61

surface temperature anomalies (14 small panels). The rst 150 years of step forcing simulations
are depicted in light gray. For experiments which are not step forcing simulations only the period
after stabilizing CO 2concentrations is shown. The black line shows the linear regression of TOA
imbalance and surface warming for the last 15% of warming. The panel on the lower right shows the
